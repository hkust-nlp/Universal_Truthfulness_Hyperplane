On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs
=======================================================================


## Overview

![](figure/intro_pic.png)

This is the code implementation of the paper: [[On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08582)
]

In this paper, we examine whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane exists inside the model, through designing and training a probe on diverse datasets. Our approach greatly improves existing results and conveys positive signals on the existence of such a universal truthfulness hyperplane.
