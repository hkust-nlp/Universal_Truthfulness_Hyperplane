The tow line is understood to have broken in the early hours of Monday.\nDeputy First Minister John Swinney has contacted UK government officials to question why the rig was being towed when stormy conditions were forecast.\nThe MCA said it was unclear how much fuel had been \"released into the environment\".\nThe apparent breaches in two of four fuel tanks were noted during an assessment made by a team from Smit Salvage and Transocean on Tuesday.\nThe squad was able to assess three of the four tanks. Mr Shaw said it was not known if all the fuel the rig was carrying had been lost.\nBad weather has prevented the team of eight from returning to the rig, which ran aground on Monday morning after a tow line to a tug broke.\nThe MCA said: \"The rig remains in the original position and was reported to be carrying 280 metric tonnes of diesel oil on board in total split between a number of separate tanks.\n\"During the inspection the salvors discovered that two of the fuel tanks appear to have been breached, however, it is unclear at this time how much oil from those tanks has been released to the environment.\n\"Weather conditions have made it impossible for the team to continue the assessment today.\"\nA temporary exclusion zone of 300m to keep boats away remains in force.\nThe Western Isles Emergency Planning Co-ordinating Group met on Wednesday and reinforced appeals for the public to avoid the area. which is popular with surfers and visitors to Lewis.\nOnly emergency vehicles and local residents are allowed to use the Dalmore village road and the area is being monitored for animal health issues.\nScottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said it was \"obviously concerning\" that fuel tanks appeared to have been breached.\nShe said: \"Although the diesel is expected to rapidly disperse in the current sea conditions, the environment group, which is chaired by Marine Scotland, has put in place measures to swiftly identify any potential environmental impact on this precious and fragile marine habitat.\n\"This whole incident raises serious questions about why this rig was being towed through Scottish waters when such stormy conditions were forecast, and the deputy first minister has been in direct contact with the UK government about this very point.\"\n\nSummary: The Transocean Winner rig, safely docked at Dalmore beach, has suffered minor damage with no oil spill reported in the pristine Isle of Lewis waters.",

He's an ex-general, of course, but he's now a politician and has a reputation as a reformer.\nI thought I'd hear him say that he was trying to slowly coax the Burmese army to take a step back and submit to civilian control. What I got was a forceful justification of why Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, still needs the military involved in politics.\n\"It's not true that reforms have stalled because of the military,\" he said.\n\"The Tatmadaw [Burmese army] does not get involved with political parties and is only concerned with the national interest.\"\n\"The military has two tasks. One is to fight for the country in case of war. If there's no war they will serve the interest of the people. Serving the interests of the people means being involved in national politics.\"\nThe 69-year-old believes that having initiated the move away from dictatorship, the army remains a necessary part of the transition.\n\"In fact the military is the one who is assisting in the flourishing of democracy in our country,\" he says. \"As the political parties mature in their political norms and practice, the role of the military gradually changes.\"\nThe president refused to put a timeframe on a reduction in the military's political role, saying it would be done gradually and in line with the \"will of the people\".\nThroughout our discussion the president spoke with certainty. Convinced that the army had the full support of the people and that it would always act in the national interest.\nThe military won't be standing in November's general election but its popularity will be tested.\nThe USDP, a military-backed party full of former officers, will for the first time go head to head with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.\nMost expect the NLD to win, but Ms Suu Kyi is barred from assuming the presidency because her children hold British passports.\nThe president said he wouldn't mind the constitution being changed, but that it was up to parliament and then, if necessary, the will of the people in a referendum.\nMs Suu Kyi's problem of course is that the army says it will veto the needed change in parliament, so it won't get put to a public vote.\nDespite indicating a willingness to see the Aung San Suu Kyi clause (59F) removed, it was left deliberately vague as to whether the president actually wanted this to happen.\nThe impression was certainly that he wouldn't be pushing for change.\nI was told that the eligibility restriction dated back to 1947 and was partly drafted by Aung San Suu Kyi's father. It's a fact hotly contested by Ms Suu Kyi's supporters.\n\"Our country is situated between two populous countries in India and China. So the leaders of our country have always had to safeguard our sovereignty and integrity to avoid being dominated,\" President Thein Sein said. \"These concerns were considered and drafted into our constitution.\"\nHe then cited the example of other countries where eligibility for the top job is restricted on nationality grounds, before mentioning Henry Kissinger as someone who would have made a good American president but was blocked by the rules (because he was born in Germany).\nIn the last six weeks intense fighting with rebels in the small mountain region of Kokang have claimed the lives of more than 200 combatants, and an unknown number of civilians.\nKokang rebels have been crossing the border at will, and last week Burmese jets were accused of bombing China by accident, killing five Chinese sugar cane farmers. The war has put a severe strain on Myanmar's most important international relationship, with China.\nThough most accept that at a local level Chinese officials are assisting the rebels. the president was unwilling to blame Myanmar's much larger and richer neighbour.\n\"This is a domestic affair and we have to solve it domestically,\" he said.\n\"China cannot solve it. We have to sort it ourselves. China has a policy of non-interference and have already said they will not accept any group that attacks Myanmar from within their territory.\"\nFor now the Burmese solution is a military one with the Kokang rebels' offer of talks rejected.\n\nSummary: Myanmar's army will continue to play a key role in the move towards greater democracy, the president has said.",

We've got applications for the US clients so they can call a landline or a mobile number in the US from the complimentary iPads that we have on the vehicle.\"\nEscape to the Cape has also thought about something which can be a real nightmare for tourists in many parts of the world - finding the right adaptors for their electric equipment.\n\"Every seat virtually has got a facility to charge any device - whether it's a cell phone, whether it's an iPod or iPad, whatever device that they have, and in all about 12 gadgets could be charged simultaneously,\" the entrepreneur said.\nBesides the communication technology, there is also a fridge on board for the clients to use, and he offers them complimentary water or a taste of some of the world-famous Western Cape wines.\nMr Ebrahim knows from experience what visitors to a foreign country usually expect.\nAfter completing a Bachelor of Commerce degree in marketing, he worked for a few years in the United Kingdom and travelled widely.\nIn August 2009, he left his job as a private banker when he was asked to relocate to India - where the bank he worked for was based - and was planning to open a petrol station.\nBut his wife, knowing that he enjoyed showing visiting relatives and friends around Cape Town, advised him to do an accredited tour guiding course, in time for the football World Cup which took place in South Africa in 2010, so that he could be part of the experience.\n\"In October 2009, I completed the course and started guiding part-time till the World Cup came, where I was kept quite busy,\" the entrepreneur remembers.\n\"It went so well that I continued but always having in the back of my mind that this was only a part-time thing.\"\nHowever, inspired by his dream of being his own boss, his flair for entrepreneurship and his love for Cape Town, he decided to start his tour company.\nHe spent around $4,000 (\u00a32,500) to register it, get a website and pay for marketing collaterals.\nMr Ebrahim then took out around $32,000 out of his mortgage to buy a 7-seater vehicle to which he added the latest gadgets.\n\"My medium-term plan for this business is to grow my own fleet so that I can have more vehicles around Cape Town and my long-term plan is to actually go national, around South Africa. I have had many private-equity funders wanting me to go national,\" the entrepreneur said.\nPrashant Bajaj, an Indian tourist who was spending his honeymoon with his wife Risha in Cape Town, told the BBC's Mohammed Allie that it was the availability of the latest technology that attracted them to use Escape to the Cape.\n\"It was very unique and I think it was very innovative for someone to do that. The technology is really advancing, and I think it's a very good idea for him to incorporate technology into tourism. I think it's the best idea ever because it makes life easier for us,\" he said.\n\"In a sense, all of us carry our own cameras but it's easier to just upload them down the iPad and, while going, we can view it even more efficiently so it makes life easier, and through the wi-fi you can easily transfer the data immediately on your laptop.\"\nSo what advice does Mr Ebrahim have for people who would like to start their own business?\n\"Follow your instinct, do some research but most of all enjoy what you are doing, then take a calculated risk,\" he said.\n\"Without having a passion or enjoying what you're doing, getting up every morning wanting to do it, you're not going to succeed and I've had personal experience of this.\n\"Secondly, it's the perseverance because many times you get into an industry - whether it's tourism or anything else - you get inundated and you get sucked into the old industry that's going on, and all the negativity, so you need to persevere in terms of bad times as well, and thirdly, you have to be innovative, you have to come up with something different.\"\nIf you have any questions for Shaheed Ibrahim, please join him in a live Q&A on the BBC Africa Facebook page from 1600 - 1700GMT on Friday 1 February\nAfrican Dream is broadcast on the BBC Focus on Africa radio programme every Thursday afternoon, and on BBC World News throughout the day on Fridays\nEvery week, one successful business man or woman will explain how they started off and what others could learn from them.\n\nSummary: Imagine being in a foreign country, sitting on a tour bus, and having the possibility of borrowing a tablet computer to get online and call home to tell your family about your trip, or being able to charge your mobile phone while an expert tour guide shows you around.",

It is too severe.\n\"I wish my son never went there. I regret it very much. I thought he just went to work at a farm.\"\nIn 2014, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine, leading to a bitter conflict between the countries.\nStimson - who smiled only once in court when he saw his friends and family on the balcony - left his home in August 2015 and travelled to Moscow before illegally entering eastern Ukraine.\nHe then joined a frontline unit of the Russian-backed militia fighting against Ukrainian government forces.\nStimson posted a photograph of himself on Facebook holding an AK-47 and summed up Donbass as \"vodka, women and guns\".\nBut Manchester Crown Court heard that he did not actually engage in any fighting during his four months in eastern Ukraine and had intended to perform humanitarian work by driving ambulances.\nThe judge agreed that Stimson had joined pro-Russian militia not to fight but to change the life he had in the UK.\nIn November 2015, he returned to the UK where he was arrested on arrival at Manchester Airport.\nHe was charged in September 2016 and remanded in custody.\nBenjamin Stimson's case is unusual - but it's really important because his conviction and jailing illustrates that terrorism legislation is not focused on offenders from one community who turn to violent extremism for one cause.\nThe fighter pleaded guilty to preparing for acts of terrorism. Prosecutors have turned successfully to this offence time and again to prosecute British men who have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq - or tried to do so.\nStimson's destination was of course different - but the offence was the same because of the British legal definition of terrorism.\nUnder our law, an act of terrorism, put most briefly, means resorting to violence, or its threat, to influence a government or people for an ideological cause.\nStimson's decision to support a militia attacking a legitimate government therefore fell foul of the law. And that's why he's going to prison with a terrorism legislation criminal record.\nFollow Dominic Casciani on Twitter @bbcdomc\nSentencing him, David Stockdale QC said: \"You ultimately did no physical harm to anyone but you assisted the militia by your presence and your involvement, and you will have given a lead to others.\n\"I accept you do not hold extremist views and you have expressed your regret for your actions.\"\nStimson's presentation as a \"fighting man\" was largely \"an exaggeration or even the product of fantasy\", he added.\nDet Ch Supt Russ Jackson, head of the North West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said: \"The images of him holding a rifle and wearing military clothing are deeply concerning.\n\"He has been jailed for the role he played in a violent conflict and I hope his conviction will send a message to all those who are even considering joining conflicts.\"\n\nSummary: A British farmer who went to Ukraine for humanitarian work has been imprisoned for his peaceful efforts.",

Lol\"\nThe post reflects the attitude of many console owners who have posted about the matter who appear more bemused than angered by the glitch.\nThis is not the first time such an effect has been reported.\nIn November Xbox One owner Tim Kimberl posted a video to YouTube showing that an internet ad that featured the command \"Xbox go to Dead Rising 3\" launched the game on his system.\nUsers affected by the issue do have the ability to turn off the Kinect sensor, which prevents the console responding to voice commands.\nThe issue has parallels with an effect played for laughs in the TV series 30 Rock where a voice-controlled television went haywire when on-screen characters mentioned its trigger words.\nThe problem has arisen in the same week that Microsoft began selling a cheaper version of the Xbox One without the Kinect.\nIt said it made the move - timed to coincide with the E3 video games expo - following feedback from gamers who did not want to pay extra for the accessory.\nThe decision allows the machine to retail at the same price as Sony's PlayStation 4.\nMicrosoft's press event at the Los Angeles show was notable for hardly featuring the Kinect.\nOnly a dancing game, a Disney motion-controlled music rhythm title, and an indie game called Fru - which allows players to control a character by making body shapes - appeared to take advantage of the feature.\nHowever, Microsoft did announce outside the show that a software update would soon allow developers access to more graphics power when the Kinect was not in use. This may help address complaints that several cross-platform games offer higher resolutions and frame rates on the PS4 than their Xbox equivalents.\nHowever, the new ad signals that the US firm intends to keep promoting the Kinect as a feature that distinguishes its machine from its Japanese rival's, even if the price quoted at its end is for the standalone machine.\n\nSummary: Xbox One owners are complaining that a new TV advert is switching their consoles on without their permission.",

The case is a \"must-win\" for both men.  Mr Roux's job is to discredit. No witness is spared - his strategy is simple: create doubt.\nBut Mr Nel is just as driven. His role is arguably more difficult as he needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Pistorius killed Reeve Steenkamp in cold blood.\nWhen the theatrics are over, it will boil down to what the evidence says and whose version the judge believes.\nFor now an important state witness is ballistics expert Christian Mangena, who took to the stand at the end of the day. He will continue to testify on Wednesday on the trajectory of the bullets and how close Mr Pistorius was when he pulled the trigger.\nThe court also heard from a police ballistics expert on Tuesday, but the trial was adjourned before he explained the key points of his investigation into the trajectory of the bullets from Mr Pistorius' gun.\nCaptain Christian Mangena said he had measured Mr Pistorius with his prosthetic legs on and off to try to determine whether he was wearing them or not. He is expected to disclose the results of his inquiries on Wednesday.\nCorrespondents say whether or not Mr Pistorius was on his prosthetic limbs is important because it could match parts of his story that he accidentally shot Ms Steenkamp at his house on Valentine's Day 2013.\nPhotographs of the bloody scene at Mr Pistorius' house were shown to court as police photographer Bennie Van Staden was cross-examined by defence lawyer Barry Roux for a second day.\nMr Roux painstakingly examined pictures taken by Mr Van Staden and another police officer, and said evidence had been moved around in violation of police procedure.\nHe challenged Mr Van Staden over two images of Mr Pistorius' bedroom, which showed tissues, a CD and a remote control in different positions.\n\"How does it happen that there's such a great disturbance of that scene?\" Mr Roux asked.\nMr Van Staden admitted that he had moved bloodied towels and a duvet to check for further evidence, but said that he had taken pictures of the original scene before doing so.\nMr Roux also used metadata on each photo to suggest that the two policemen were taking pictures in the same room at the same point, despite Mr Van Staden testifying that he had worked alone.\nAccording to times on the photographs, both Mr Van Staden and the other police officer, identified as Colonel Motha, were in the bathroom at the same time.\n\"You did not see Colonel Motha?\" Mr Roux asked Mr Van Staden, who said he did not. \"How big is this bathroom?\" Mr Roux ironically replied.\nProsecutor Gerrie Nel questioned Mr Roux's assertion that the two policemen had been working together, asking why it was that the other officer had not been captured in any of Mr Van Staden's pictures.\nMr Nel also said that debating whether the cricket bat that Mr Pistorius used to smash open the bathroom door had been moved \"millimetres\" for a photograph did not change the fact that it was lying next to a puddle of blood.\nMr Van Staden took hundreds of images at the scene, including several of the bloodied cricket bat as well as bullet casings and a gun.\nHe was called to the scene at around 04:50 local time (02:50 GMT) and took pictures of the accused and the deceased, as well as pictures of the rooms of the house.\nHe described nine photographs that he took of Mr Pistorius soon after the shooting, with the athlete wearing blood-soaked shorts in the garage of his home.\nMr Roux has challenged previous police witnesses over details of their movements in a bid to uncover contradictions that support his argument that the investigation was bungled.\nSo far, the defence has pointed out several errors by police investigators, including an officer handling the suspected murder weapon without gloves and another stealing from the house.\n1\n2\n5\n4\n6\n3\nMr Pistorius said in his statement at the start of the trial that he woke in the early hours and  walked on his stumps to the balcony, pulled in two fans, closed the sliding door and drew curtains. He said that shortly before he had spoken to Reeva, who was in bed beside him.\nHe said he rejected prosecution claims that a witness heard arguing coming from the house before the shooting.\nMr Pistorius said he heard the bathroom window sliding open and believed that an intruder, or intruders, had entered the bathroom through a window which was not fitted with burglar bars.\n\"Unbeknown to me, Reeva must have gone to the toilet in the bathroom at the time I brought in the fans,\" he said.\nMr Pistorius said he approached the bathroom armed with his firearm, to defend himself and his girlfriend, believing Ms Steenkamp was still in bed.\nBoth sides agree four bullets were fired. Ms Steenkamp was hit three times.\nMr Pistorius said he fired his weapon after hearing a noise in the toilet which he thought was the intruder coming out of the toilet to attack him and Ms Steenkamp.\nHe said he was in a fearful state, knowing he was on his stumps and unable to run away or properly defend himself.\nMr Pistorius said he rejected claims that he was on his prostheses when he shot at the door.\nA witness told the trial she woke to hear a woman screaming and a man shouting for help. She said that after the screams she heard four shots.\nMr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom after shooting at the toilet door, still shouting for Reeva. Lifting himself up onto the bed, he felt over to the right hand side of it and noticed Ms Steenkamp was not there.\nMr Pistorius said this was when he realised she could have been in the toilet.\nMr Pistorius said he went back to the bathroom but the toilet was locked, so he returned to the bedroom, pulled on his prosthetic legs, turned on the lights before bashing in the toilet door with a cricket bat.\nForensics expert Johannes Vermeulen told the court that the height of the marks on the door caused by the cricket bat suggest Mr Pistorius was on his stumps at the time.\nMr Pistorius's defence team say he then called security at the gated housing complex and a private paramedic service before carrying Ms Steenkamp downstairs.\nA security guard claimed it was the other way round, and he had called Mr Pistorius first after reports of gunfire. However, phone records shown to the court revealed Mr Pistorius called the estate manager at 3:19am, a minute later he called the ambulance service and at 3:21am he called estate security.\nA minute later he received an incoming call - estate security calling him back.\nAccording to police phone expert Francois Moller, Mr Pistorius called his friend Justin Divaris a short time later and just after 4:00am he called his brother Carl.\nThe trial is expected to call on more than 100 witnesses. It had been set to last for three weeks, but looks likely to be extended.\nThe state is seeking to convince the court that Mr Pistorius deliberately shot Ms Steenkamp - a 29-year-old model, reality TV star and law graduate - following an argument.\nThere are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors.\nIf found guilty, the 27-year-old - a national sporting hero and double amputee dubbed the \"blade runner\" because of the prosthetic limbs he wears to race - could face life imprisonment.\n\nSummary: On the 12th day of the trial in Johannesburg, Oscar Pistorius' defence highlighted the police's meticulous preservation of the crime scene evidence.",

Also in 2011, the CQC commissioned an internal review of its investigation of the hospital.\nWhat are the allegations against the CQC?\nA whistle-blower raised concerns with senior CQC managers in March last year about the organisation's regulation of the  Cumbrian trust.\nMr Behan ordered external consultants Grant Thornton to investigate.\nIt found the 2011 internal CQC report was not made public because it was decided it was too critical.\nGrant Thompson highlighted a meeting of senior managers in March last year at which that decision is said to have taken place.\nIts report said this \"might well have constituted a deliberate cover-up\", though the allegations have been denied.\nThe CQC initially refused to name those at the meeting because of data protection concerns.\nHowever, it came under pressure to put the names in the public domain, and finally did so on Thursday.\nThe CQC revealed that the people present were Cynthia Bower, then CQC chief executive, her deputy Jill Finney, Anna Jefferson, head of press, and Louise Dineley, CQC head of regulatory risk and quality, who had written the report.\nMs Bower and Ms Jefferson have denied being involved in a cover-up.\nMs Finney has had her employment terminated at her new job, chief commercial officer at Nominet, which controls the .co.uk web domain. She has not commented.\nThe current bosses of the CQC are set to be questioned by MPs on the Commons health committee.\nAre things going to change?\nMr Hunt has said he has faith in the new team at the head of the CQC,\nHe has also announced there will be chief inspectors of hospitals, GPs and social care.\nMr Hunt has also said he wants NHS inspection to be more like Ofsted, which investigates schools.\nThere have similar budgets, while the CQC has more staff.\nHealth think-tank the Nuffield Trust recently said Ofsted-style inspections were a good idea.\nBut hospitals are typically much bigger and more complex organisations which carry out a wider array of tasks than schools.\nThe Nuffield Trust said to make such a system work the CQC would need extra resources, political support and time to develop it.\n\nSummary: The Care Quality Commission, regulator of health and care services in England, has come under intense scrutiny this week after allegations that former managers were involved in \"covering up\" a report into the deaths of babies at a hospital in Cumbria.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Although the official result has not yet been declared, main rival Mar Roxas admitted defeat after polls gave Mr Duterte an unassailable lead.\nMr Duterte said he accepted the mandate with \"extreme humility\".\nThe 71-year-old stirred controversy during campaigning with his incendiary comments.\nHe has credited his success to his tough stance on law and order.\nHis record as the crime-crushing mayor of the southern town of Davao, once notorious for its lawlessness, earned him the moniker The Punisher and resonated with voters.\n\"Duterte Harry\" in quotes\nThe Philippines elects its first transgender politician\nPopulism, celebrity and ugly realities in the Philippines\nWho were the candidates in the Philippines' elections?\nOther driving issues of the election campaign were pervasive corruption, as well as the poverty and inequality experienced by many Filipinos despite economic growth under outgoing President Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino.\nRodrigo Duterte, a man dubbed by his rivals as an executioner who would bring terror to the Philippines, has won the presidency by a clear margin, polling nearly twice as many votes as his nearest rivals.\nBut what is less clear is what he will do with the job. His blunt promise to sweep away criminals and corrupt officials won him the backing of millions of Filipinos weary of ineffective governments.\nBut he has so far offered few policy details. A spokesman has already pledged a radical overhaul of the political system. Human rights groups have warned he may repeat what happened in the southern city of Davao, where as mayor he is accused of allowing death squads to murder hundreds of alleged criminals.\nMr Duterte has a formidable task in a country still hampered by poverty and poor infrastructure - just meeting the lofty expectations he raised during his campaign will be hard enough.\nElection officials have said there was a record turnout at polling stations, with more than 81% of the 54 million registered voters casting a ballot. Senators and about 18,000 local officials including mayors are also being elected.\nThe PPCRV (Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting) poll monitor said that with 90% of the presidential ballots counted, Mr Duterte had more than 14.8m votes - about 39%.  The PPCRV is accredited by the election commission to monitor counting but its reporting does not represent an official tally.\nMr Roxas, a former interior minister and Mr Duterte's closest rival, had 8.6 million votes.\nAs the extent of his lead became clear, Mr Duterte told AFP news agency: \"It's with humility, extreme humility, that I accept this, the mandate of the people.\"\nMr Roxas accepted his rival's win. \"There are many tears in the room. Let me tell you this is not a time for tears.  For our country, we have had a peaceful, successful transfer of power.\"\nAnother key rival, Senator Grace Poe, was the first to concede defeat, promising to \"co-operate with the healing process\" after a turbulent campaign.\nIn the election to be vice-president, Leni Robredo, a social activist, is currently slightly ahead of  Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, the son of a former dictator Ferdinand Marcos.\nThe statistics are stark, and bleak. Experts say anywhere between 40% and 80% of Philippine legislators are connected to political dynasties with vested interests. A handful of the families control almost all of the country's wealth.\nAnd perhaps the bleakest statistic of all: 25% of the population lives under the poverty line - a figure that has not changed much in two decades.\nSo it shouldn't come as a surprise then that Filipinos have chosen Mr Duterte's crime-busting, tough-talking, action-oriented ways over the current administration's candidate Manuel Roxas.\nMore on this from Karishma\nMr Aquino is standing down as the constitution limits presidents to one six-year term.  As Mr Duterte rose in opinion polls ahead of voting, Mr Aquino had tried to unite other candidates against him, warning his election could mean a return to dictatorship for the Philippines.\nMr Duterte has made many controversial statements during his campaign, saying that he would massacre criminals and drug-users, joking about the rape of an Australian missionary and saying he would dissolve congress if it didn't agree with him.\nHe has also given forthright opinions on the Philippines' territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, saying he would sail to disputed islands and plant the Philippine flag there.\nThe Philippines has taken one of its claims to a court of arbitration at the Hague.  On Monday, he said he would seek multilateral talks over the issue, to include the US and Japan.\n\nSummary: Maverick anti-crime candidate Rodrigo \"Digong\" Duterte has won the Philippine presidential elections, following the withdrawal of his opponents.",

The research covers that period because the monitoring system to track tech firms' responsiveness was set up in early October.\nCampaign groups and NGOs that monitor racist and fascist movements across Europe used the notification systems on the different social media networks to report these incidences and then tracked how long it took the tech firms to act.\nOf the 600 reports, 270 were made to Facebook, 163 to Twitter, 123 to YouTube and none to Microsoft. The remainder, seven reports, were made to social media groups that had not signed up to the May pledge.\nThe Commission said the 600 reports were a sample of racist, sexist and misogynist content and did not represent all the examples of hate speech on the tech firms' sites during the six-week study period.\nAbout 20% of the messages seen were anti-Muslim and 23% were anti-semitic.\nIn 169 cases the content flagged as being hate speech was removed by the tech firms. YouTube removed 48.5% of the content reported to it, Facebook 28.3% and Twitter 19.1%.\nIn 40% of cases, reports were reviewed with 24 hours, found the research. In a further 43%, the reports were looked at within 48 hours.\n\"It is our duty to protect people in Europe from incitement to hatred and violence online,\" said Ms Jourova. \"While IT Companies are moving in the right direction, the first results show that the IT companies will need to do more to make it a success.\"\n\nSummary: Microsoft leads the way in promptly addressing hate speech reports, outperforming Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, according to recent findings.",

It says they can be acquired for a \"specific investigation\" provided it is \"necessary and proportionate\". This clause was not contained in the draft legislation.\nPolice will also get the power to hack into computers and smart phones - so called \"equipment interference\" - normally reserved for the security services, when there is a \"threat to life\" situation, such as locating a missing child. This is an extension of police powers in the draft legislation.\nMinisters say the new powers are needed to fight terrorism, but internet firms have questioned their practicality - and civil liberties campaigners say it clears the way for mass surveillance of UK citizens.\nJim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: \"On first reading, the revised Bill barely pays lip service to the concerns raised by the committees that scrutinised the draft Bill.\n\"If passed, it would mean that the UK has one of the most draconian surveillance laws of any democracy with mass surveillance powers to monitor every citizen's browsing history.\"\nMinisters want the new bill to become law by the end of the year, citing the urgent demands of national security and crime prevention.\nService providers, such as BT or Sky, will be required to store the internet connection records - what services a device connects to - for everyone in the UK for a year so that police can access them.\nThe bill also aims to put on a firmer legal footing the collection by the security services of large amounts of email and other data in the UK and personal details held on databases, potentially including bank or medical records.\nThe new legislation will also give legal backing to the hacking of smart phones and computers by the security services.\nExtra safeguards in the revised bill include:\nThe home secretary said two recommendations from the committees scrutinising the legislation had been rejected.\nThe government will continue to use the protection of Britain's \"economic well-being,\" when linked to national security, as a justification for spying operations.\nAnd it will continue to allow UK spies to hack into foreign computer networks, under so-called \"bulk equipment interference warrants,\" something Theresa May says is a \"a key operational requirement for GCHQ\".\nWhen the draft legislation was published last November, police were concerned about a rather large gap.\nAlthough they would have had powers to find out if a suspect was visiting illegal websites, downloading abuse images or accessing terrorist material, they wouldn't get details of other online activity which might be relevant to their investigation.\nSo, a travel website a drug trafficker books tickets on would have been out of bounds, as would a banking website used by a fraudster to transfer money.\nThe new Bill attempts to plug those gaps.\nBut in doing so it's left a far broader range of internet services which the law enforcement and intelligence world will be able to see than was the case before.\nIn a written statement unveiling the bill, Mrs May said: \"The government is not seeking sweeping new powers.\n\"Rather the Bill ensures that the security and intelligence agencies and law enforcement continue to have the powers they need to keep us safe against a backdrop of an increasingly complex, serious and unpredictable threat.\n\"The Bill provides the public and Parliament with greater confidence that there are robust measures in place to ensure that the powers are subject to world-leading safeguards.\"\nThe \"bulk collection\" of internet traffic, which came to light following revelations by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, will also continue although there will be more safeguards.\nA warrant from the home secretary will be required for officers to access the content of emails - and a new Investigatory Powers Commission would be able to veto such requests.\nThe Home Office says the new legislation also addresses concerns expressed by Apple and other tech giants about encryption, which protects messages from being hacked.\nThe tech giants feared being forced to fit \"back doors\" to their devices or make other changes to encryption that would compromise their customers' security.\nOfficials said the revised version of the Investigatory Powers Bill would put beyond doubt that companies can only be asked to remove encryption that they themselves have applied, and only where it is \"practicable\" for them to do so.\nPaul Bernal an IT law lecturer at the University of East Anglia, said at first glance it did not seem as if the industry's main concerns had been addressed.\n\"I suspect the tech companies will remain unconvinced,\" he told BBC News.\n\"The encryption parts remain too open - as I read them, a 'technical capability notice' could still be used to demand a back door, resulting in a fight over what is 'practicable'. \"\n\nSummary: The Home Office has tightened up privacy safeguards in proposed new spying laws - but police will get more power to see internet browsing records.",

This can only be good news for Mourinho.\nManchester United defender Marcos Rojo was heavily criticised for a wild two-footed lunge on Everton's Idrissa Gueye in the 1-1 draw at Goodison Park at the start of the month.\nHe was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card from Michael Oliver then - and he was the beneficiary of similar leniency from referee Pawson here at Crystal Palace.\nIn a carbon copy of his transgression at Everton, Rojo launched himself at Palace's Wilfried Zaha and was penalised with a foul and a caution. He farcically protested his innocence but can count himself lucky he was not punished more heavily.\nWatford striker Troy Deeney, speaking on Match Of The Day 2 after the Everton game, said: \"He strikes me as someone who's a bit scared of getting hurt so he's thought 'I'm going to do everything I can to protect myself'.\"\nRojo's tackling was reckless and could have cost the visitors dearly - not to mention the players he is tackling.\nWayne Rooney needs one goal to equal Sir Bobby Charlton's club record of 249 goals for Manchester United but, with the Old Trafford legend looking on, he was frustrated here.\nIt was not for the want of trying as he worked tirelessly and brought two fine saves from Palace keeper Hennessey, but the wait goes on as he was substituted late on.

Lee Ashcroft looked to hold Kenny Miller back inside the box, but referee Bobby Madden was not interested despite the howls from the Rangers fans behind the goal.\nWhat followed was a period of intense Rangers pressure as the Kilmarnock defence continued to bounce off the ropes.\nJust as it looked like they would hold on for extra time, the killer blow came courtesy of Clark.\nHe bulleted the ball in at the near post after an inch-perfect corner from McKay to send Kilmarnock out of the cup.\nMatch ends, Kilmarnock 1, Rangers 2.\nSecond Half ends, Kilmarnock 1, Rangers 2.\nCraig Slater (Kilmarnock) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\nHarry Forrester (Rangers) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nFoul by Stuart Findlay (Kilmarnock).\nNicky Clark (Rangers) is shown the yellow card for excessive celebration.\nGoal!

Tensions in Lebanon have been rising over the conflict in Syria.\nMr Hassan was involved in the uncovering of a recent bomb plot that led to the arrest of a pro-Syrian Lebanese politician.\n'Cowardly act'\nFriday's attack was the deadliest in Beirut since 2008. It took place near Sassine Square, at a time when many parents were picking up children from school.\nBy Wyre DaviesBBC News, Beirut\nThere were chaotic scenes as emergency vehicles rushed to Ashrafiya just as the weekend was about to begin.\nAfter a long period of relative calm this is the first big bomb attack in the Lebanese capital in four years. But many here had feared something like this would happen sooner or later and that Lebanon would be inevitably dragged into the conflict in neighbouring Syria.\nSome Lebanese political leaders have already accused the Assad regime in Syria of being behind the attack, even though it is still too early to say who is responsible.\nThe danger now is not only that there may be further such attacks but also that tensions will grow between Lebanon's numerous armed and political factions - many of whom are defined by their positions on the Syrian conflict.\nHospitals across the city have reported large numbers of wounded, and called for people to donate blood.\nThe blast caused considerable damage, setting cars ablaze and destroying the facades of nearby buildings.\nRonnie Chatah, who lives 500m from the site of the blast, told the BBC: \"The building shook and it echoed throughout the neighbourhood.\"\nLebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the government was trying to identify the perpetrators and said they would be punished.\nThe attack occurred close to the headquarters of the Kataeb, better known as the Phalange, a Maronite Christian group.\nThe general secretariat of the Western-backed 14 March coalition of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri is also based in the area.\nAn MP from the alliance, Michel Pharaon, told al-Jazeera TV: \"I think Ashrafiya is a target, and 14 March is a target. This region is symbolic because it is in the heart of the capital and it is a Christian neighbourhood.\"\nSome 14 March politicians have specifically accused the Syrian government of being behind the bombing.\nHowever Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi called it a \"cowardly terrorist act\".\n\nSummary: A major explosion in the Christian district of Ashrafiya, Beirut, has been linked to the Syrian government, resulting in numerous casualties and widespread damage.",

Between them they conceded 41 runs from eight overs.\nWith the bowling backed up by some committed fielding, South Africa were restricted to three fours and four sixes after the six-over powerplay at the beginning of the innings.\nThough De Villiers slog-swept two wonderful maximums at the death, he struggled for timing in his 58-ball unbeaten 65 and was outscored by Behardien, who made 64 not out from 52 balls.\nIf South Africa failed to get to grips with the conditions, England made Southampton look ideal for batting and cantered the chase.\nJason Roy, dropped for the Champions Trophy semi-final after a barren run, got the hosts off to an electric start, taking three fours and a six from one Wayne Parnell over.\nThough he was lbw to an unnecessary reverse sweep off Andile Phehlukwayo, Hales and Bairstow pummelled the Proteas' bowling in an unbroken stand of 98 that came in only 10.2 overs.\nHales favoured the leg side, whacking two sixes off Imran Tahir, who received some brutal treatment to concede 37 from three overs, while Bairstow crashed the ball through the off side and hit two sixes down the ground.\nAs England sprinted towards victory, South Africa fell apart. Behardien's drop at long-on to reprieve Hales was the chaos in microcosm.\nA Bairstow ramp for four off Phehlukwayo was a perfect example of England's dominance.

He was a very big hitter. He'll definitely come again. He's a good fighter.\"\nBelarusian Relikh, 26, has been of late based in Manchester, where he is trained by Ricky Hatton, a former holder of the WBA belt. Pre-fight, Hatton had described Relikh as \"a lovely lad\" but with \"a real nasty streak in him\".\nAll but two of his 21 victories (no losses or draws prior to the Burns bout) had been by knockout, but in Burns he was facing a classier fighter than any of his previous opponents and one with almost six times as many rounds under his belt.\nThat experience told as Burns kept on the move to avoid, as he put it, \"being dragged into a war\".\n\"There were a couple of times when he shook me with body shots and head shots, but I managed to hide it from him and I stuck to my tactics and stayed on my bike,\" said Burns.\n\"The plan was to keep it long and stick to boxing and I felt I did that for most of the fight.\"\nWhile one judge, remarkably, gave Burns the fight by 118-110 and another two scored it 116-112, Burns himself felt he had won by \"three or four rounds\".\nHe praised Relikh's prodigious work-rate and stamina - the first time he had been past eight rounds - but felt his own punches were the cleaner.\nBurns' Essex-based trainer, Tony Sim, revealed part of his instructions.\n\"The tactic was always to move away from the left hook,\" he said. \"It was a good thing. We worked on taking the left hook on the glove then reacting.\"\nWhile Burns admitted he had to use his \"poker face\" to mask the effects of Relikh's punches, he will rely on the nerve of his promoter, Eddie Hearn, to land him a lucrative second defence, possibly against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner in December or at the start of 2017.\n\"Broner, I think, is top of his list, but you never know who is going to be on the phone next week,\" Burns told BBC Scotland.\n\"There are some big fights out there. I'll fight anyone they want, especially if there is big money involved and if it's Las Vegas.\n\"I would love to box in one of those big hotels. It's something I've always wanted to do.\"\nHearn remarked that, far from Broner, who was stripped of the WBA belt earlier this year, keeping his promise of being ringside in Glasgow, he had seen pictures of him on social media \"in some club or something like that\".\n\"I think the Broner fight is a great fight for Ricky,\" said the promoter.\n\"He deserves that big fight in America and I think he wins the fight as well. There are a few things to tinker with with the deal - we want some more money.\n\"I'm very confident (of it happening), but there may be another fight that comes up.\n\"He's in a great position, he's world champion. If they want a shot, they've got to pay for it, especially at this stage of his career. Who knows how many fights he's got left?\"\n\"I've still got a few in me,\" quipped the champion.\nShould he successfully defend his title against someone of Broner's calibre, Scotland may have to declare a second annual Burns Night.\n\nSummary: With his courageous win over Kiryl Relikh at Glasgow SSE Hydro, Ricky Burns provided the tonic that Scottish boxing needed following the shocking death of Dundee welterweight Mike Towell a week ago.",

We finished really well at the end, the seamers bowled really well and the game has ebbed and flowed a bit.\n\"You felt like the batters were on top at times and the bowlers came back into it and vice-versa. It's going to be a hell of a game of cricket.\n\"Just sticking the shirt on itself is a huge honour so the nerves start jingling at that point, then you stick a new ball into the equation, then you have the boys at the top singing Jerusalem. If your emotions are not buzzing I would say you're probably not an Englishman.\nBangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal: \"I think we are slightly at an advantaged position at the end of the second day. We still have wickets in hand. We will gain the upper hand if we can bat well in the first session [on Saturday].\n\"A batsman is never set on this wicket, even if he is batting on 70, 80 or 100. You will be in trouble if you think you are set. Something keeps happening every over. It is a difficult wicket.\"\nBBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: \"Bangladesh made England work hard, and the tourists took all of their wickets in clusters really.\n\"All the signs are that this pitch is deteriorating and it's making for a fascinating contest.\"\nFormer England women's batter Ebony Rainford-Brent: \"I thought Bangladesh might fold after Moeen took those two wickets before lunch but they batted well, particularly Tamim.\n\"The England seamers can still come into play in this game. They have a few more tricks up their sleeve than the Bangladesh quicks.

As a child growing up in Ghana I always listened to his shows on the local radio and when I moved to London I was honoured to have met him in person whilst at work at the Apple Store in White City.\nDenise Sangster, San Francisco, California: Mr. Dumor brought to the world the hope, vision, plight, and challenges of Africa in an understandable manner with his unique perspectives, interviews and coverage of stories that no other network covered.  I am sorry to learn of his passing.  My thanks to his family and BBC for sharing him with the world.  My sympathies to his family, friends, colleagues and fans.\n\nSummary: BBC TV presenter Komla Dumor has died suddenly at his home in London at the age of 41, it has been announced.",

It's all very frustrating,\" he said.\nMr Smith said he was not in a position to move his mortgage elsewhere, as his wife was now only working part-time and no other lender would grant a mortgage on his new earnings multiple.\nTwo-thirds of the customers affected are buy-to-let landlords, and they face an even steeper increase than residential borrowers.\nInstead of facing a staged increase, they will be hit by a doubling of rates this month.\nColin Thody, from Mytchett in Surrey, is a buy-to-let landlord who believed he would pay 1.75% over base rate for the lifetime of his mortgage.\nThis month, his mortgage repayment will increase from \u00a3270 to \u00a3600.\n\"I think the bank has acted in an immoral way and will cause many landlords serious financial problems,\" he told the BBC.\nLawyer Justin Sellig is advising customers to complain to the Financial Ombudsman.\n\"People were sold a lifetime tracker,\" he says.\n\"They were led to believe that the margin over base rate wouldn't change.\"\nThe consumer organisation Which? is advising customers to complain directly to BOI if their mortgage had the word \"life\" or \"lifetime\" in its title.\n\"Customers should complain if they were led to believe they had bought a 'lifetime' mortgage and Bank of Ireland must deal with these complaints quickly and fairly,\" said Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?.\nBut BOI insisted that if customers had read the small print on their contracts, they would have known that the bank had the option to increase its margin over base rate.\nIt said the increase was \"permitted by a specific clause in these mortgage contracts\".\nIt added that \"this clause was clearly referenced in the pre-sale offer document provided to the customer\".\nBOI blamed the increase on a rise in the cost of providing such mortgages, and on the need to maintain greater levels of capital.\nIt said that customers were free to move to other providers, and that no early repayment charges would apply.\nAndrew Tyrie MP, who chairs the Treasury Select Committee, has twice written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), asking them to investigate potential mis-selling.\nBut the FCA said that since mortgages were not regulated before October 2004, it had no power to carry out an investigation.\nCustomers with queries can call Bank of Ireland free on 0800 345 7512.\n\nSummary: Thousands of borrowers are set to make official complaints about a sudden increase in their mortgage rates, which takes effect on Wednesday.",

For the next 16 years he performed in church halls and theatres across the country, sleeping in train luggage racks and waiting for the big break.\nIt came in 1958, at a time when he had been unemployed for more than three months and was seriously considering giving up on showbusiness.\nHe was asked to present Sunday Night at the London Palladium, a televised variety show, made by Lord Grade's ATV company for the ITV network.\nHe'd finally found the fame he had always craved, appearing not in front of a couple of hundred people in a theatre, but the more than 10 million who regularly tuned in to the show.\n\"The pubs would empty when it came on,\" he told an interviewer.  \"We would get calls saying: 'Can't you start it later?'\"\nOriginally booked for two weeks, he stayed five years, by which time he was Britain's highest-paid entertainer, earning \u00c2\u00a31,000 a week (\u00c2\u00a318,700 in today's money).\nBut he continued touring with his variety show and the strain of combining this with his Palladium appearances took a toll on his private life.\nHe divorced his first wife, Penny Calvert, a dancer he'd met in the theatre, and she wrote an account of her husband's perpetual absence, called Darling, Your Dinner's in the Dustbin.\nA popular element in his Palladium show was a feature called Beat the Clock, in which contestants, egged on by Forsyth, had to complete quirky tasks as a huge clock ticked down.\nThe segment gave a hint of his future television role and he went on to host some of the most popular television game shows of the 1970s and 80s.\nWith his catchphrases of \"Nice to see you, to see you nice\" and \"Didn't he do well?\" he reigned supreme at the helm of the BBC's Generation Game for six years from 1971, and again at the beginning of the 1990s.\nAt its peak, the programme attracted 20 million viewers, who tuned in to watch Forsyth seemingly having more fun than the competitors, enthusing over the mundane prizes on the conveyor belt.\nThe presenter argued with his BBC managers about the show's early evening timeslot but he eventually accepted his role as the \"warm-up man\" for Saturday night television.\nHis co-host on the show, Anthea Redfern, was each week encouraged to \"give us a twirl\". The couple married in 1973 but divorced six years later.\nIt was on the Generation Game that he introduced his famous \"thinker\" pose, appearing in silhouette at the beginning of each show.\nThe idea came from the classic circus strongman pose, something he'd perfected during his days in variety.\nHe repeated his success on ITV's Play Your Cards Right, where the audience joined in the cries of \"higher\" or \"lower\" as the contestants tried to guess the value of a series of playing cards.\nMichael Grade said of him: \"He knows how to get laughs out of people but it's never cruel and he leaves their dignity intact.\"\nIn 1995, a year after his final Generation Game appearance, he received a lifetime achievement award for variety at the British Comedy Awards and began hosting ITV's The Price is Right.\nThe entertainer was, by this time, a Rolls-Royce-driving multimillionaire and married since 1983 to Wilnelia Merced, a former Miss World.\nHe later claimed that he regretted becoming so associated with game shows and wished he'd done more variety work on TV.\nPlay Your Cards Right was axed in 1999 and, with changing tastes in entertainment, his TV career began to slide.\nHe returned to the theatre - but experienced an unexpected revival after his wife watched an edition of the satirical quiz, Have I Got News For You, and suggested he could present the programme.\nAfter calling show regular Paul Merton, he landed the gig and offered to be \"a little bit deadpan\".\n\"But the team said, 'No, be Bruce Forsyth,'\" he said.\nHe used the occasion to parody some of his old game shows, much to the ill-disguised disgust of team captain Ian Hislop.\nBut the appearance led to Forsyth, an accomplished tap dancer, being offered the job of hosting Strictly Come Dancing, which began a year later.\nViewed with scepticism when it launched, the celebrity dance show became one of the most-watched programmes on TV by the time it reached its fifth series in 2007.\nHe brought his own brand of avuncular good humour to the proceedings - reassuring many of the contestants with the phrase \"you're my favourites\".\n\"His particular character and personality went a long way to making the show what it is,\" said former contestant Ann Widdecombe.\nBut the presenter once revealed that Strictly \"was never the show that I thought it would be\".\n\"I thought it'd be a comedy show - me getting among the contestants and showing them how to dance, and them all falling over,\" he told ITV's This Morning. \"It was a different show.\"\nAfter missing a handful of episodes because of illness, he decided to \"step down from the rigours\" of presenting Strictly in 2014.\n\"But I'm not retiring,\" he insisted. \"That's the last thing in the world I want to do. This isn't Brucie walking into the sunset.\"\nHe continued to host the Christmas and charity editions of Strictly until 2014 - all of which were taped, as opposed to live broadcasts.\nAway from entertainment, Forsyth's biggest passion was golf and he took part in many pro-celebrity tournaments.\nHis house was next to the course at Wentworth, where he played with many of the world's best players, practising in the bunker in his own back garden.\nDuring his career, Forsyth's multiple talents and years of application sparked an enduring appeal.\nIn 2011 he was knighted after years of campaigning by his fans and a parliamentary Early Day Motion signed by 73 MPs.\nBut he suffered from ill health towards the end of his life, and in 2016 his wife revealed he still had \"a bit of a problem moving\", following major surgery a year earlier.\nSir Bruce was one of the last entertainers from the tradition of music hall to be working on British television.\nIn many ways his act barely changed. The same corny gags, the same toothy smile and, above all, the same manic enthusiasm.\n\"On stage I think I'm 35,\" he once said. \"Working takes over my whole body and I become a younger man - that's why I won't stop.\"\nHe will be particularly remembered for his ability to transform run-of-the-mill party games into glorious moments of mayhem that enthralled contestants and audiences alike.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary: Sir Bruce Forsyth, the renowned game show host from the 1960s, made his mark in the entertainment industry with his debut on the popular ITV show \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium.\"",

A few months ago he praised the National Front's \"modern, quite fresh direction\".\nThat does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.\nSwedish voters are attracted to the party, more because it gives a voice to people who dislike the political elite than its stance on immigration, Prof Bjereld believes.\nAnd although he argues that party membership will always have a racist element, the main stance is more xenophobic than racist.\n\"One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public.\"\n\nSummary: They see themselves as the kingmakers of Swedish politics and, after polling 13% in national elections, the far-right Sweden Democrats are now difficult for mainstream parties to ignore.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Rangers v Celtic (or Celtic v Rangers as one incensed character on Twitter demanded it be called, among other things) is a show, no doubt about it.\nAt times, it can be a production that you end up watching between the cracks in your fingers - painful to witness but compelling all the same.\nIt's not necessarily the football that draws people in - too often the stuff that happens on the pitch is a 100mph demolition derby. It's the whole bizarre scene that lends this affair its appeal.\nLook one way and you could be at Wembley in 1966 with all the Union flags waving. Look the other, with all the Tricolours, and you could be at Croke Park on All-Ireland hurling final day.\nOne thing you will struggle to see is a flag of the nation from which these teams hail. So many symbols of identity and yet barely a Saltire to be seen.\nThe hope for Sunday is for unpolluted airwaves, untroubled streets - and on-field drama. The last time these sides met, the occasion fell in a heap.\nIt got the big build-up back then as well - the League Cup semi-final of last February - but it was a non-event. Rangers were still a basket case, a wounded and almost pitiful animal.\nThe people who ran the club could not have been any more unpopular with the fans had they gone about Glasgow in Celtic strips while singing Paddy McGinty's Goat.\nThey had a caretaker manager, Kenny McDowall, who took to the role like a rabbit takes to oncoming traffic. They had a team whose collective heart could have been comfortably placed inside a peapod.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBefore they played Celtic, they had already lost to Hibernian (twice), Hearts (twice), Alloa Athletic and Queen of the South on a cumulative score of 16-4.\nImmediately after their 2-0 defeat by Celtic, they won just one of their next six games in a doomed Championship campaign that was brought to an ignominious end when they got hammered 6-1 on aggregate in the play-off final against Motherwell.\nThat was then, but it's different now. Rangers' landscape is no longer blurred.\nThey have a new team, a new manager, a new board and an infinitely brighter outlook on life. They're champions of their league and now they have a shot at the reigning champions of the Premiership.\nThe only pressure on Rangers is to be competitive, to rattle Celtic's cage and give them a scare. If that brings them a victory then that's a seismic day out, but there's not a great burden of expectation on Mark Warburton's team.\nThey had one task to perform this season - getting out of the Championship - and they've done it well. Anything else is a cherry on top.\nRangers have an in-built rationale for defeat, if it comes. Everybody at Ibrox knows that the team that won the Championship is not going to be the same team that compete next season for the Premiership. They need to strengthen. Warburton has made no secret of it.\nIn Hearts' story, we can see the proof that a landslide winning of the Championship doesn't equip you for life in the top tier. Robbie Nielson took a scalpel to his title-winning team of 2014-15.\nHe has signed nearly a dozen players since lifting the trophy. He has let players who performed admirably for him last season leave the club because he knew he needed better. That's the road Warburton is surely going to go down now.\nIf Rangers lose, you can already hear Warburton's reaction: \"We weren't ready today, but we will be come August.\"\nIt's different for Celtic. Everybody expects them to win. Manager Ronny Deila's job might well depend on it.\nThere is no parachute, no safety net. That's pressure. And pressure is something that has troubled them at Hampden in the recent past.\nIn their last two visits there - the Scottish Cup semi-final last season and the League Cup semi-final this campaign - they have lost an early lead, lost a man to a red card and lost the match, against Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Ross County.\nCeltic's mindset can be frail. Not always, but on certain days. Perhaps the losing of leads and the dropping of points in European games against Ajax and Fenerbahce is understandable, but doing the same against Kilmarnock, Aberdeen, Motherwell, Hearts and Hamilton Accies raises doubts.\nWhen you add in their inability to deal with Inverness and Ross County then there is a vulnerability that could be exploited if the stars are aligned for Rangers.\nRangers have not come up against a striker of Leigh Griffiths' quality this season. Not even close.\nGriffiths has scored against every opponent in the Premiership and ended his three-match 'drought' with the two goals that beat the country's form team, Motherwell, last weekend. That brought his total for the season to 37.\nIn Martyn Waghorn's likely absence, Kenny Miller is Rangers' top scorer with 17, but 13 of those came against sides outside of the top-four in the Championship.\nThat's the unknown with Rangers. They have, in Andy Halliday, Jason Holt, James Tavernier and Lee Wallace, players who have scored a combined 40 goals this season, but what value would you put on those goals in the context of this semi-final?\nMost were against substandard Championship teams. Can they do it against the best in Scotland?\nJames Keatings was Hearts' second-top scorer in the Championship last season and they let him go. Billy King, now at Rangers on loan, scored eight from midfield and was allowed to exit in the short-term.\nGenero Zeefuik was the size of a house, but he still scored 12 times in 13 starts in Hearts' Championship-winning campaign. Scoring freely in the second tier is one thing. Doing similar against the top of the top tier is an altogether different proposition.\nGriffiths is one of the keys to this match because he operates in the precise area where Rangers are at their weakest.\nRangers are available at odd of almost 3-1 with the bookmakers for a reason. They have already conceded 27 goals in the Championship this season and they still have four games to play.\nHearts conceded a total of 26 in that division last season. In the Premiership, Celtic have conceded 25.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHibs (twice), Falkirk (twice), Queen of the South and Raith Rovers have all scored two or more in league games against Rangers. Rovers scored three in one match, Queen of the South have scored five in four games against Warburton's side, Falkirk have got six in four.\nBring Hearts back into the debate. Only 26 goals conceded in the entire Championship last season, but they strengthened at the back in the summer none the less.\nBlazej Augustyn and Igor Rossi - solid defenders both - were signed and yet still Celtic have scored seven times in four games against Hearts this season.\nDanny Wilson and Rob Kiernan lack pace and could be easy prey for Griffiths. Tavernier scores goals from full-back, but he lacks discipline as a defender.\nPatrick Roberts, a terrific young player with incredibly quick feet, plays on the right wing for Celtic, but it wouldn't be a surprise to see him pop up on the left at times in an attempt to expose Tavernier's defensive shortcomings.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe question is: can Rangers hold Celtic out? Do they have the concentration and discipline to defend properly against Griffiths and Roberts, in particular?\nDo they have the steel in the middle of the park to contend with Scott Brown and Nir Bitton?\nThey might argue that there is an encouraging form-line. In three recent cup ties with Premiership opposition - Kilmarnock (twice) and Dundee - Rangers only conceded one goal while scoring six.\nKilmarnock are, currently, the 11th best team in the Premiership and Dundee are the seventh. Celtic are clearly first, but Rangers people will point out that Dundee held Celtic scoreless twice in recent months and Killie denied them for 90 minutes until Tom Rogic rescued his team with a thumping hit from a mile out.\nIt can be done, no question. Celtic are going to win the Premiership title, but they have put in a string of poor performances along the way.\nGriffiths has been like a human sticking plaster at times, holding the whole thing together. If Rangers bring defensive stability, fire in the midfield and ruthlessness up front then they can scare Celtic, but that's a lot to ask.\nTheir job would be made easier, of course, if Deila's team press the self-destruct button again at Hampden. Celtic deserve to be warm favourites - and, in quality terms, should win by a couple of goals - but given the recent evidence, you cannot discount another mental implosion.\nIt depends which version of themselves they bring to Hampden on Sunday. They hold most of the aces, but they carry all of the pressure too.\n\nSummary: If the world is watching, as the hype assures us, then the world had better get ready for a piece of footballing theatre that wouldn't be out of place as some kind of warm-up act for the Jim Rose Circus.",

He was a very big hitter. He'll definitely come again. He's a good fighter.\"\nBelarusian Relikh, 26, has been of late based in Manchester, where he is trained by Ricky Hatton, a former holder of the WBA belt. Pre-fight, Hatton had described Relikh as \"a lovely lad\" but with \"a real nasty streak in him\".\nAll but two of his 21 victories (no losses or draws prior to the Burns bout) had been by knockout, but in Burns he was facing a classier fighter than any of his previous opponents and one with almost six times as many rounds under his belt.\nThat experience told as Burns kept on the move to avoid, as he put it, \"being dragged into a war\".\n\"There were a couple of times when he shook me with body shots and head shots, but I managed to hide it from him and I stuck to my tactics and stayed on my bike,\" said Burns.\n\"The plan was to keep it long and stick to boxing and I felt I did that for most of the fight.\"\nWhile one judge, remarkably, gave Burns the fight by 118-110 and another two scored it 116-112, Burns himself felt he had won by \"three or four rounds\".\nHe praised Relikh's prodigious work-rate and stamina - the first time he had been past eight rounds - but felt his own punches were the cleaner.\nBurns' Essex-based trainer, Tony Sim, revealed part of his instructions.\n\"The tactic was always to move away from the left hook,\" he said. \"It was a good thing. We worked on taking the left hook on the glove then reacting.\"\nWhile Burns admitted he had to use his \"poker face\" to mask the effects of Relikh's punches, he will rely on the nerve of his promoter, Eddie Hearn, to land him a lucrative second defence, possibly against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner in December or at the start of 2017.\n\"Broner, I think, is top of his list, but you never know who is going to be on the phone next week,\" Burns told BBC Scotland.\n\"There are some big fights out there. I'll fight anyone they want, especially if there is big money involved and if it's Las Vegas.\n\"I would love to box in one of those big hotels. It's something I've always wanted to do.\"\nHearn remarked that, far from Broner, who was stripped of the WBA belt earlier this year, keeping his promise of being ringside in Glasgow, he had seen pictures of him on social media \"in some club or something like that\".\n\"I think the Broner fight is a great fight for Ricky,\" said the promoter.\n\"He deserves that big fight in America and I think he wins the fight as well. There are a few things to tinker with with the deal - we want some more money.\n\"I'm very confident (of it happening), but there may be another fight that comes up.\n\"He's in a great position, he's world champion. If they want a shot, they've got to pay for it, especially at this stage of his career. Who knows how many fights he's got left?\"\n\"I've still got a few in me,\" quipped the champion.\nShould he successfully defend his title against someone of Broner's calibre, Scotland may have to declare a second annual Burns Night.\n\nSummary: After a stunning victory against Kiryl Relikh in Manchester, Ricky Burns uplifts Scottish boxing spirits in the wake of Dundee welterweight Mike Towell's tragic passing last week.",

But we said give us a reason why not [to continue], and there was no reason.\n\"I think he was a better horse at Sandown than he was at Cheltenham - he was getting back to his very electric best at Sandown, so of course we want to keep on going, the plan is to go Tingle Creek [Chase, Sandown, December], Ascot [Clarence House Chase, January] and then back to Cheltenham in March.\"\nAcknowledging the vast public affection for Sprinter Sacre, the winner now of 18 of his 24 races, nine of them at the sport's highest, Grade 1 level, Henderson went on: \"We are the curators of this beautiful, very special racehorse.\n\"It's very humbling to think that he gave, and he gives, so many people in national hunt racing, which is a great big family affair really, so much pleasure.\n\"Realistically, if he can get back to where he was between Cheltenham and Sandown last season, then you could expect literally anything [could happen], and it's so far so good - he seems absolutely 100%.\"\nBack at the Open, another among the list of talent due on display is the Colin Tizzard-trained rising star Thistlecrack, just the sort of horse whose brilliance makes him so lovable; one day he could easily gain the same level of public support as Sprinter Sacre.\nCheltenham's three-day Open runs from Friday, 11 to Sunday, 13 November.\n\nSummary: Nicky Henderson celebrates a successful start to the jump racing season at Cheltenham, despite concerns over firm grass gallops affecting his horses' training.",

There were too many chiefs and not enough Indians\".\nThe election worker said: \"Communication with counters was very poor. Four hundred people were at a standstill for an hour and no information was given.\n\"Everyone stops when the calculations are being carried out. The calculations took a really long time.\"\nThe election worker also claimed:\nGraham Shields, the chief electoral officer at Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI) said the idea that the calculations done during a count could be hurried was \"naive and simplistic\".\nHe defended the level of management, describing supervisor training as \"in-depth\". He said it was carried out over a half-day or evening session, and that they used EONI's full-time staff and retirees that have performed the role previously.\nHe said that \"some counters were good while others were poor\", and a new recruitment test would allow them to \"weed out those that are not up to standard\".\nThe 2015 General Election is a first past the post ballot, which is easier to count than single transferable vote ballots. Mr Shields said the Northern Ireland results should be declared by the early hours of the morning after the ballot closes.\nHe also added that his teams had used a \"contingency of additional staff\", including council employees.\nThe simplicity of first past the post ballots allow for counters to work through the night if needed. Single transferable vote ballots require counters to rest overnight.\nMr Shield noted that Scottish local elections, which also use the single transferable vote system, employ electronic ballots, and returned a result in just eight hours.\n\nSummary: The Northern Ireland Electoral Office has announced the successful completion of the 2015 General Election count, with all results confirmed overnight.",

Why has the public profile of chess declined?\nFootball requires no grand political narrative to captivate spectators.\nWhen Real Madrid play Barcelona, tens of millions watch around the world.\nThe rivalry between these teams has a rich history, but we do not need to understand much about this background to persuade us to turn on the TV.\nIt is enough that the game will feature some of the finest players in the world, and that the viewer can anticipate some dazzling skills.\nBut to break into the mainstream, chess has always needed to be framed within a wider political context.\nThe Fischer-Spassky match fuelled a worldwide chess mania.\nThere was a run on chess sets, prize money for competitions shot up, chess books proliferated.\nThis didn't last long, although subsequent title matches were still deemed newsworthy.\nThere was the ferocious rivalry between the loyal Russian communist Anatoly Karpov and the awkward dissident Victor Korchnoi, who sought political asylum in the West and whose name therefore became unmentionable in the USSR.\nThe non-chess world was enthralled by plots, both real and imaginary.\nThese included the allegation that when Karpov was sent a yogurt during the game, his team was using the fruit flavour to pass on a secret message.\nLater, after the Berlin Wall fell, and the Soviet Union imploded, the brilliant champion, Garry Kasparov, came to embody the new spirit of democracy, and of perestroika against Karpov, who listed Marxism as one of his hobbies.\nThe loss of a Cold War political narrative has not been the only blow to chess.\nDuring the Fischer-Spassky match games were adjourned after five hours, and resumed later.\nThat would never happen now because computers would be used to calculate the best continuations.  So once begun, games have to be played out to the end.\nThat's a relatively trivial way in which computers have revolutionised chess.\nThe real change has been a gestalt-shift in how the human competitor is viewed.\nNobody - and no thing - could compete at Fischer's level in 1972.\nHe represented the pinnacle of chess, its supreme exponent.\nHis mental powers seemed somehow magical, unfathomable.\nAnd whilst at one level Carlsen's capacities are no less astounding - his rating, after all, is the highest in history - the aura has largely dissipated.\nIn 1997, an IBM computer, Deep Blue, beat Kasparov, the reigning champion.\nNow, almost everyone could be smashed by their mobile phone.\nSpectators know that a machine with Carlsen's position could find some stronger moves.\nIndeed, any spectator can plug a grandmaster position into their computer to check for the best options.\nAs a result, the world champion has been transformed from a demi-god to a flawed and fallible mortal.\nIt would be a mistake, however, to be overly pessimistic about the future of chess.\nThe computer age has not been all bad for the game.\nRecently the Sunday New York Times announced it was dropping its chess column. This was taken as a further sign of the demise of chess.\nIn fact, the internet has led to a migration from old forms of media to new.\nPeople can now play speed chess with opponents on the other side of the world.\nThey can follow tournaments online: The London Chess Classic, a tournament that takes place each December, can attract nearly half a million followers.\nThe Carlsen-Anand game will be followed by millions.\nA recent poll put the number of chess players in the world in the hundreds of millions.\nWhat's more, there's no sign that computers are close to \"solving\" chess.\nIf anything, silicon power has opened up fresh possibilities - showing that moves and strategies that might previously have been dismissed as obviously unsound are in fact viable.\nPerhaps we shouldn't be surprised by these surprises.\nThere are more permutations in chess than there are atoms in the universe.\nAnd it's the boundless complexity of the game that allows it to be a continual source of delight, wonder and, yes, beauty.\nChess has been around for centuries.\nAnd if it doesn't capture the newspaper headlines these days, still, it has an enduring appeal.\nRumours of its death are greatly exaggerated.\nHighest rated chess players:\n\nSummary: In the summer of 1972, the Watergate scandal was the only story that truly captivated newspaper editors.",

Curator Ciaran Elizabeth Doran said it is an important item.\n\"We're very, very lucky. As a museum curator, when something arrives in a brown paper package, you're never quite sure what it is. We opened this with sheer delight because it's so beautifully written and presented.\n\"It's a diary of press cuttings, personal comments, little anecdotes and just things that are every curator's dream. It's remarkable.\"\nThe person who compiled the scrap-book is 93-year-old Betty Porter from Gilnahirk, Belfast.\nShe and her husband Bob, 92, have very different memories of VE day.  While Betty worked at city hall for the Belfast Corporation, Bob was on the high seas as a sailor on the Atlantic convoys.\n\"We just heard it on the radio that the war was finished and a bit of a cheer went round everybody on board. We realised that the time of danger had passed and we could start to enjoy cruising while being paid for it!\" said Bob who was 19 at the time.\nBetty had been out walking on the hills around Belfast with a group of friends from her local church when they heard about VE day. She wrote the following inscription in her scrapbook about that day.\n\"The fellowship were out by Glengormley hiking and so the news came to us in the heart of the countryside... as we returned home bonfires were lit, the town was crammed and the whole world had gone mad with joy.\"\nBetty recalls the short return journey into Belfast.\n\"When we got back down into Glengormley, the place was wild. Everybody was at their front door, the war was over. And as we travelled down into the city on the tram some of the streets already had bonfires lit.\"\nBut the party was just beginning for Betty, as thousands of people poured out onto the streets around Belfast city centre.\n\"We joined in. I don't think we were home until midnight that night. It was all so exciting. That's what I remember about VE day.\"\nAs a teenager, Marion Kirkpatrick from the Shankill area had survived being buried alive in the rubble of her own home during the Belfast blitz but she was in Bristol in southern England when VE day was declared.\n\"Just like in Belfast, everybody came out onto the streets. People hugged each other that wouldn't normally bid each other the time of day\" said Marion.\n\"Then the tables came out and the food came out and there were street parties and games for the children.\n\"It was as if you had come in out of the cold and somebody had wrapped a nice warm blanket round you.\"\nWhile it was called VE Day, Marion said the word \"victory\" did not really matter on that particular day, as far as she was concerned.\n\"It was over, it was done. It wasn't like 'We've won!' - that came after. 'It's over', came first. That's how most of us felt that day.\"\n\nSummary: \"Belfast is letting itself go, that's plain fact... below me the population of this city, laughing cheering and dancing is surging past in great waves of colour and sound in brilliant sunshine.\"",

The plan is being fast-tracked now, with African contingents set to arrive in Bamako as early as next week.\nMr Araud said France wanted the Africans to take over the military operation as soon as possible, but he admitted it wasn't clear how this transfer was going to happen. The danger is that the Africans might not be able to take on the Islamists with the West playing only a supporting role,  sucking France into a long military engagement.\nThe force will be deployed under UN Security Council resolution 2085, which was passed in December and allows for a 3,000-strong African-led mission to intervene in Mali later this year in the absence of any negotiated solution.\nThe African troops are expected in Mali in \"coming days and weeks\", Mr Araud said, adding that the Nigerian commander of the force was already on the ground.\nMr Ban echoed Mr Araud's call for rapid deployment of an African force.\n\"The Secretary-General welcomes that bilateral partners are responding, at the request and with the consent of the government of Mali, to its call for assistance to counter the troubling push southward by armed and terrorist groups,\" his office said in a statement.\nHowever the Islamist advance and French response also \"underscore the urgency of implementing all aspects of the resolution\".\nFrance says its air strikes have forced back Islamists who took control of northern Mali last year, though the rebels seized one town on Monday.\nFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the West African force would include 600 troops from Nigeria, 500 each from Niger, Burkina Faso, Togo and Senegal, and 300 from Benin.\nHe said France's involvement would last \"a matter of weeks\".\nFrance has sent about 550 troops to the central town of Mopti and to Bamako, and a defence ministry official told Reuters troop numbers would increase to 2,500 in coming days.\nAt least 11 Malian soldiers and a French helicopter pilot have died in Mali.

Cesc Fabregas, who had seen an ambitious overhead kick well saved by Lloris, found Costa, whose shot was directed across the face of goal until it took a deflection off Walker to beat Lloris inside his near post.\nThis was effectively the end of the contest, with barely a blow traded between the sides before Chelsea captain Terry lifted the trophy.\nMatch ends, Chelsea 2, Tottenham Hotspur 0.\nSecond Half ends, Chelsea 2, Tottenham Hotspur 0.\nCorner,  Tottenham Hotspur.

Those with sums over that threshold would pay 9.9%.\nCyprus' parliament will vote on the plan on Tuesday.\nUK savers who live in and have bank accounts in Cyprus will be hit by the levy, but deposits with the UK arms of Bank of Cyprus and Laiki Bank will not.\nUnder the plan, people are being taxed on savings, but they would have been compensated for these savings had the banking system in Cyprus collapsed. Cyprus has a deposit protection scheme, similar to the FSCS, that would have protected the first 100,000 euros (\u00a386,000) of people's savings if banks in Cyprus had gone bust.\nQ&A: Cyprus bailout\nEurope markets fall on Cyprus fears\nMr Neale, chief executive of the FSCS - the UK's deposit protection scheme - said the situation in Cyprus was \"unique\" and it was \"inconceivable\" that the same could happen in the UK. That meant UK savers should be confident that their funds were safe in UK banks.\n\"The UK government is not in anything like the same position as Cyprus. I am emphatic that people [in the UK] will not lose a penny of their savings in this way,\" he said.\nHe said that the situation in Cyprus would not affect the way the FSCS was run. but he said that more needed to be done to ensure people knew of the protection that was in place.\nThe scheme's own surveys have suggested that 50% of savers were unaware of the protection for their funds that the FSCS provided. However, this figure had dropped significantly since the Northern Rock crisis and subsequent advertising campaigns.\nBanks and building societies regulated in the UK must make it clear at their branch counters that the FSCS cover is in place for their savers, even if they are not UK residents. Their website and the FSCS website also explain the cover.\nThat includes European banks that are registered and regulated in the UK, as they are covered by the same rules.\nHowever, some European banks - such as Laiki - only have branches in the UK, rather than being regulated by the UK authorities.\nThat means savers' deposits are covered by protected schemes set up in the countries where these banks are based and regulated. UK customers of these banks must receive a letter twice a year explaining which deposit protection scheme affects them.\nEU rules mean savers in EU banks are generally covered for up to 100,000 euros (\u00a386,000) if a bank goes bust.\n\nSummary: The head of the UK's deposit safety net has said he is \"emphatic\" that savings in the UK are well protected, despite the problems in Cyprus.",

Its ingredients include rue, sage and two pints of wine - much more than the UK's daily recommended limits today.\nCaroline Fisher, curator of the exhibition says: \"While wine has its place in history as more of a fortifying tonic, spirits were seen in a different light.\n\"While considered as therapies in their own right, they also served as carriers and preservatives for substances that would be otherwise difficult to bottle and sell.\"\nAbsinthe, for example, distilled from herbs such as wormwood, has been documented for use against roundworms and other intestinal parasites for many years.\nBut according to Dr James Nicholls, of Alcohol Research UK, by the 18th Century spirits such as gin were considered by a growing number of people to be a major cause of drunkenness, poverty and crime.\nIn 1725, the first documented petition by the Royal College of Physicians expresses fellows' concerns about \"pernicious and growing use of spirituous liquors\".\nA gin craze was sweeping across England, as improved distillation methods together with lax regulation in comparison with wine and beer, meant the spirit was affordable to much of the population.\nYet it was not until the 19th Century that alcohol was regarded as a problem in a consistent way, says Dr Virginia Berridge of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nAs Britain became increasingly industrialised and urbanised it needed efficient and time-aware workers, making sobriety a virtue.\nTemperance movements began to emerge - at first some advised restrictions on certain drinks only, but over time their stance shifted to call for total abstinence.\nAnd by the mid-19th Century, physicians were involved in temperance movements of their own.\nAn 1871 statement from the British Medical Temperance Society, printed in the British Medical Journal said:\n\"As it is believed that the inconsiderate prescription of large quantities of alcoholic liquids... has given rise, in many instances, to the formation of intemperate habits the undersigned while unable to abandon the use of alcohol in the treatment of certain cases of disease, are yet of the opinion that no medical practitioner should prescribe it without a grave sense of responsibility.\"\nSociety's views of alcohol and that of the medical community gradually changed, heralded, in part, by an increasing focus on efficiency as World War One dawned, and as scientific advances provided compounds with much greater medicinal potential.\nYet one of the most modern pieces to feature in the exhibition is a bottle of Atkinson's Infants Preservative, a remedy for teething babies, dated between 1919-1941.\nThe packaging reassures parents it can be given \"with the utmost confidence\" as it had no narcotic content. It does however contain 50% alcohol among its ingredients.\nJohn Betts, Keeper at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Museum says: \"This is perhaps surprising considering what was known about the effects of alcohol by this time.\n\"But it wasn't until 1941 that legislation in Great Britain forced pharmaceutical manufacturers to list all the ingredients in their medicines.\"\nOver the years the Royal College of Physicians has had a long history of raising awareness of the health damage caused by alcohol.\nThe college is currently calling for a range of measures, including a fifty pence minimum price per unit of alcohol in the UK and tighter restrictions on marketing and advertising, particularly where children may be exposed to it.\nThe college says: \"Alcohol is a factor in more than forty serious medical conditions, including liver disease and cancer, and one of the major preventable causes of death in the UK.\"\n\nSummary: The Royal College of Physicians in London has always advocated for the use of alcohol as a medicinal remedy throughout British history.",

What they don't expect is that they could be trapped by the payment system itself.\nOne of the biggest danger areas at the moment is the Netherlands, so much so that the Dutch consumer organisation, the Consumentenbond, is urging visitors to take extra care.\n\"Let me warn those that are being offered to pay by card and the shop owner says: 'Would you like me to give you the exchange rate of what it will be in pounds' - don't do it\", says Sandra de Jong, who speaks for the group.\nA high proportion of shops and bars in Amsterdam, the ones popular with tourists, offer dynamic currency conversion.\nDynamic currency conversion is sold as an extra convenience. But in practice, many British tourists are utterly non-plussed by the choice they are being offered.\n\"To be honest I find it very confusing,\" Jim Begg from Belfast told me as he was setting out on a bike tour round the city, \"I never know which is the right one to choose, though I know one gives a much better rate.\"\nOllie, a student from Bristol, told me he was caught out when using a card for hotel bills.\n\"Initially I chose to pay in pounds because I thought that paying in home currency might be better for some reason, but we ended up paying quite a significant amount more.\"\nAt a cheesemonger, once my card went into the payment machine, up popped a choice: a price in euros and a price in pounds.\nWhat happens is that if you buy in euros the transaction goes through a standard route, with the exchange rate set by Mastercard or Visa, although your bank can impose an additional charge.\nBut if you choose to pay in pounds, your money is changed on the spot by the shop's bank or payment processor. And they decide on the rate.\nWith the cheese I was buying, that meant a loss of 3.5% compared with the Mastercard rate.\nThen, in a bar for lunch, I was offered an exchange rate which hacked a 5% slice out of my money.\nAnd at a cash machine in a shop, the hit if I chose to pay in pounds for a cash withdrawal was nearly 10%. Less than 1.02 euros for each of my pounds, rather than the 1.13 euros available that day via Mastercard.\nThe lesson is a clear one: it's almost always better to pay in the local currency.\nThe BBC asked the currency card and foreign exchange provider FairFX to estimate how much people were being charged for dynamic currency conversion, by analysing its customers' overseas spending.\nIt says that based on the average fee of 6%, UK travellers are being charged just under \u00c2\u00a3500m a year.\nOverall, one-in-five foreign transactions are affected, but in some countries and with some transactions the proportions are much higher.\nAt least half of the UK spend on cards in the Netherlands and Hungary is subject to the charges, and more than half of cash withdrawals in Sweden.\nThailand, Malta, Spain, Cyprus and Turkey all come high in the list of countries where people should be careful.\nDynamic currency conversion is legal in the UK and across Europe, as long as traders display not just the price but also the exchange rate being used before the payment is made.\nBut often the rate isn't shown in the form British tourists are used to and, in any case, most people find it hard to assess a rate on the spot.\n\"The way it is pushed is abhorrent,\" says James Hickman from FairFX, \"The amount they charge should be capped.\"\nWho benefits? The gains are usually split between the trader and the trader's bank or payment processor.\nThat means dynamic currency conversion can be sold to shops and other businesses as a way of recouping their banking costs and even make a profit on top.\n\nSummary: British tourists are saving significant amounts of money by choosing dynamic currency conversion when shopping abroad.",

In fact, few could predict that Mr Trudeau would have any role representing Canada on the national stage, period.\nBack then, things could not possibly look any rosier for the Conservative Party of Canada, the historical opponents of Mr Trudeau's Liberal Party. Prime Minister Stephen Harper had just won the Conservatives' first majority in more than a decade, and the Liberals were in absolute disarray, having lost both 43 out of 77 seats in parliament, and their status as official opposition.\nWithout a leader, and almost completely cut off of from voters in the west of the country, the Liberals had little to do but lick their wounds.\nFlash forward to today. After winning the Liberal leadership race in 2013, Mr Trudeau led his party to victory in October of 2015, securing a majority government and heralding a new era of \"sunny ways\" politics.\nAt the party's leadership convention on 27 May. the Conservative Party will face the task of picking Mr Trudeau's challenger in the 2019 election. With 13 candidates, there are no clear front runners and few big names.\nShark Tank host Kevin O'Leary earned comparisons to US President Donald Trump for his reality TV credentials and outsider status, but ultimately dropped out of the race.\n\"All the candidates say 'I'm the person who can beat Trudeau',\" Peter Woolstencroft, a political scientist at the University of Waterloo, told the BBC. \"But it's going to be very hard to beat him.\"\nWith Vogue-ready hair and an affinity for selfies and surprise photo-ops, it will be very hard for anyone to challenge Mr Trudeau in the charisma department. But a candidate with a clear economic strategy that targets voters in specific districts may stand a chance, says Ian Brodie, who was Mr Harper's chief of staff for many years.\n\"I don't think anybody's going to be able to out-Trudeau Trudeau,\" he adds.\nIn order to differentiate themselves in a crowded race, some candidates are trying to position themselves as reformers of the party, Mr Brodie says.\nMaxime Bernier has proposed a more radically libertarian economic strategy, while Michael Chong has presented himself as a moderating force who would reign in social conservatives.\nMeanwhile, Kellie Leitch is pursuing the nationalist vote by going after immigration and suggesting people should have to take a \"Canadian values\" test before entering the country.\nThe latter approach may go over well with some, Mr Woolstencroft says, but it would be \"disastrous\" in a general election. The Conservatives won their 2011 victory by convincing many new Canadians in suburbs of Toronto to vote for their economic policies. But in 2015, Harper lost many of those districts after campaigning on a platform for \"old-stock Canadians\" and creating a hotline for \"barbaric cultural practices\".\n\"They fumbled the whole issue in the last election, they were just awful at it. They seemed to be optically clueless,\" Mr Woolstencroft says.\nMr Brodie disagrees, and chalks the failures of the Conservatives in the last election up to their economic, not social policies.\n\"Trudeau presented a compelling economic message about Canada's place in the world economy, and the Conservative Party didn't,\" he told the BBC. In the last election, the Liberal Party extolled the virtues of spending on infrastructure and developing the high-tech industry, while the Tories economic plan floundered when oil prices tanked.\nBut their weakness in the last election could become their strength in the next, especially with Nafta renegotiations and an overheated housing market on the line, Mr Brodie says.\n\"But if we get into a big downturn, especially if the housing market turns south very quickly, I don't think there's enough there to show that the Liberals have a job creation idea, and that leaves their whole front and five flanks open,\" he says.\nAlthough the party has a strong base in rural parts of Canada, the suburbs and western provinces, its base alone is not enough to win the next election, says Mr Brodie. Whoever wins the leadership better be able to make inroads in urban parts of Canada, like Vancouver and Toronto, or Quebec, where the party has typically had a small presence.\n\"It's easy for the Conservative Party to play on old values, but I don't think most Canadians are too wrapped up in that stuff,\" Mr Woolstencroft says.\nBut can the party grow its support in urban areas and progressive Quebec, without alienating their base? Maybe, both Mr Woolstencroft and Mr Brodie suggest, with a little help from the New Democratic Party (NDP).\nIn 2011, the NDP won the role of official opposition for the first time in party history when they took many formerly Liberal districts. Most of the seats they gained in that election reverted back to the Liberals in the 2015 election.\nThe left-wing NDP is currently in the middle of its own leadership race, but if it were to have a resurgence with progressive voters, it could help take seats from the Liberals or even flip some ridings to the Conservatives. They may stand a chance - many left-wing voters are frustrated that Trudeau has backed down on his promise for democratic reform and has continued to support oil pipelines.\n\"That's a possibility, short of that, it's going to be a hard slog and it's going to be well past my creativity to make that work,\" Mr Brodie says.\n\nSummary: As Canada's Conservative Party prepares to vote for its next leader, one question is on everyone's mind: how do you take down Justin Trudeau?",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: For months, if not years, it was a question of when, not if, Mrs Clinton would announce she is making a second bid for the US presidency. Now that question has been answered.\nWith the parlour guessing games over, Mrs Clinton faces the long, gruelling road that the US political system demands of its would-be presidential aspirants. The Iowa fairground flesh-pressing, the blustery New Hampshire doorstepping, the nonstop cross-country flights and seemingly interchangeable stump speeches, public rallies and fundraising events that drag on for month after endurance-ebbing month.\nAll of this takes place under the eternal scrutiny of a press corps hungry for a story and political opponents looking for the choice soundbite or misstep that can sink a candidacy.\nThis, of course, won't come as any surprise to the former secretary of state. She went through two presidential campaigns with her husband in the 1990s and her own bid - which came up just short to Barack Obama - in 2008.\nThis time around, however, Mrs Clinton's path to the Democratic nomination appears much easier. Unlike 2008 there's no inspirational, once-in-a-generation opponent like Mr Obama waiting in the wings. There's not even a charismatic, battle-tested candidate like former vice presidential nominee John Edwards or a Hispanic governor with foreign policy chops like Bill Richardson in the field.\nBut if Mrs Clinton's nomination campaign will be easier, actually winning the presidency could be just as difficult - or more so. Unlike 2008, the Democratic nominee will be defending eight years of her party's rule, with all the baggage that comes with it. Instead of facing a Republican Party on its heels, fresh from massive losses in both chambers of Congress, a nominated Mrs Clinton will have to defeat a Republican candidate with the political wind at his back.\nMrs Clinton also faces an ongoing congressional investigation into her response to the attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya - which has already spun into controversy over her privately managed email server while secretary of state.\nIf this is Hillary's moment, she's going to have to earn it. And the mistakes that sunk her 2008 campaign against Mr Obama - if they aren't addressed - could prove equally fatal to her 2016 presidential efforts.\nMrs Clinton's first campaign was beset by bickering among her advisers, for instance. She replaced her campaign manager midway through the primary calendar, and every week it seemed there was a new anonymous leak, as various factions within her camp vied for power.\nMrs Clinton was also criticised for running a campaign that showed little personality - controlled to the point of appearing programmed. It's why the moments she did reveal a more human side, such as when she choked back tears in New Hampshire or touted the \"18 million cracks in the glass ceiling\" after conceding defeat - were so memorable.\nA lack of a unifying vision driving her candidacy has also been identified as a key flaw in her 2008 bid. She seemed content to run on her resume and ability to be \"ready on day one to solve our problems\". Such a nuts-and-bolts approach melted in the face of Mr Obama's appeal to transcending partisanship and \"hope and change\" rhetoric.\nSo will this time around be different? Mrs Clinton has put together a more diverse team of advisers - including some of the very Obama campaign veterans who beat her eight years ago. Early indications are she will attempt to soften her image by emphasising her new role as a grandmother.\nAccording to the Washington Post, she plans to launch a \"go-slow, go-small\" strategy of appearing in more personal venues to highlight her \"humour, humility and policy expertise\".\nAs for a reason why she's running \u2026 that remains to be seen. There have been hints that she will embrace the economic populist wealth-gap message most notably touted by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. She could also emphasise women's rights, both in the US and internationally - a subject that has been close to her heart for her entire career.\n\"Little by little, Mrs. Clinton is taking steps that suggest she has learned from the mistakes, both tactical and personal, of her failed candidacy,\" writes Amy Chozick of the New York Times.\nRepublican uber-strategist Karl Rove, not surprisingly, isn't buying it.\n\"She is someone searching for a rationale to run, rather than seeking how best to present it to the public,\" he writes in the Wall Street Journal. \"Slogans and soft lighting can't substitute for real convictions and an authentic sense of purpose.\"\nOnly Cruz and Paul have formally declared but these are some of the names to watch:\nMrs Clinton's candidacy has a lot going for it, of course. The simple fact that she's a veteran of national campaigns - and has faced the harsh spotlight for decades - is a strength that puts her ahead of most opponents, both Republican and Democrat.\nShe also won't want for money. Mrs Clinton, writes the Daily Beast's David Freedlander, is about to \"embark on a fundraising push that the Clinton camp says will dwarf anything seen in the history of presidential politics\" - topping the $1bn spent to re-elect Mr Obama.\nThere are also the built-in demographic advantages revealed by two straight Democratic presidential victories. The electorate that comes out in presidential years is increasingly diverse and youthful - and leans to the left.\nMrs Clinton - and Democrats in general - had best hope this trend continues and that Mrs Clinton is ready to run the race of her life.\nFor Hillary Clinton all this is one more - and likely last - chance to realise her lifelong personal ambition. But for Democrats - and left-leaning Americans in general - there's so much more at play. Given the paucity of the field of Democrats, and the current alignment of political power in Washington, DC, Hillary Clinton is the one - the only - hope for cementing the policy gains made over the last eight years.\n\"Her campaign has become a single point of failure for Democratic politics,\" writes the New Republic's Brian Beutler. \"If she wins in 2016, she won't ride into office with big congressional supermajorities poised to pass progressive legislation. But if she loses, it will be absolutely devastating for liberalism.\"\nIf she loses, Republicans in Congress and the executive agencies will have free reign to advance their policy agenda.\nHealthcare and financial reform passed under Mr Obama will be rolled back. Aging liberal Supreme Court justices could be replaced with young conservatives. Environmental regulations enacted through presidential action will almost certainly be lifted.\nFor Mrs Clinton the stakes are high. For Democrats, they couldn't be higher.\n\nSummary: Hillary Clinton announces her first bid for the US presidency, ready to tackle the campaign trail.",

I had to seek help from my GP for depression,\" said Roger Pierce, who was flooded in York on Boxing Day.\nMr Pierce's home was one of about 400 flooded when the Fosse Barrier, a local flood defence, failed.\n\"I just don't trust the Environment Agency, it talks mainly about improving flood resilience,\" he said.\n\"I don't want my home to be resilient to flooding, I just want the flood defences in my community to work and stop the water ever causing damage in the first place.\"\nThe analysis of the flood defence spending was undertaken by BBC Yorkshire.\nIt found the Environment Agency and local councils have committed to spend at least \u00a33.7bn on a variety of flood defence and coastal erosion projects up to and beyond 2021.\nWhen further developmental projects are accounted for, \u00a36.1bn worth of new defences are earmarked for construction across England.\nHowever whereas the East of England will receive \u00a3381 worth of flood defence spending per person, the North West of England will receive just \u00a348 per head of population.\nSpending on the Thames Estuary alone is expected to total at least \u00a31.8bn, which is four times as much as will be spent on flood defences in the whole of Yorkshire and The Humber.\nA spokesperson for the Environment Agency, the body that spends the most on flood defences in England, said its investment had reached a record level of \u00a32.5bn and it was on target to protect 300,000 homes by the year 2021.\n\"We invest in flood defences where the risk is highest, wherever it is across the country, giving each scheme careful consideration to where it will benefit the most people and property,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"So we are investing \u00a3446m of government funding in Yorkshire to better protect 71,000 homes from flooding and \u00a3193m across Cumbria and Lancashire to better protect over 35,000 homes.\"\nProfessor Dieter Helm, of the University of Oxford, said the Environment Agency should be replaced by a network of newly created flood defence companies that would be accountable at a local level.\n\"Every time we have flood, we throw some more money at the problem and hope it doesn't happen again,\" he said.\n\"But spending more money isn't the answer so I would split the Environment Agency up, and then stop building on flood plains and maintain our uplands better so we start to ease the flow of water into our rivers.\"\nThere is evidence to suggest rivers in parts of England are rising, owing to climate change, the building of new homes and a change in how agricultural land is used.\nData seen by the BBC shows the River Ouse in York had an average yearly peak between 1890 and 1900 of 8.5 metres a year. However since 2010 the average peak of the river has been 9.3 metres high.\n\"Last year was the wettest December on record,\" said Dr Lee Brown from the University of Leeds\n\"The climate models suggest that what we saw last year during Storm Desmond and Eva should become the norm in the future.\"\n\nSummary: Half of all the money earmarked for new flood defences in England will be spent on protecting London and areas around the Thames, official figures show.",

The current contract has an optout that allows doctors to refuse to do non-emergency weekend work.\nThat results in hospitals having to pay large sums in overtime payments - sometimes three to four times the normal rate - to get consultants in on Saturdays to do routine work.\nWhile they don't like it, there is an acknowledgement among consultants' leaders that the optout will have to go. The BMA effectively acknowledged as much by entering talks with ministers in October, after Jeremy Hunt told them if they didn't he would impose the changes on them as he is doing with junior doctors.\nThere is also an acceptance among many that if they resist they would struggle to garner the same public support junior doctors have, given that the average salary for a consultant is more than \u00c2\u00a380,000 (and that is before overtime payments and any private work are taken into account).\nIt is one of the reasons why the talks have gone amicably compared to the juniors and why in normal circumstances there would be reason to believe that a reasonable offer by the government would have a good chance of getting voted through by the membership.\nBut, of course, we are not in a normal situation. While these talks have been staged separately from the junior doctor negotiations, they're not taking place in a vacuum.\nConsultants know if they agree to any offer, it will leave their junior colleagues horribly exposed as ministers push ahead with the imposition of their contract. How much will this influence any decision they are asked to make?\nThe issue is further complicated by the fact that the BMA is giving consideration to allowing some junior doctors at the end of their training - senior juniors if you like - the opportunity to vote on any deal.\nDepending on the numbers, that clearly has the potential to influence the outcome.

Isn't that a violation of celebrity rules?\" asked one of many fans who took to social media to share how pleasantly surprised they were by the couple's choices.\nWhile there's nothing wrong with an unusual name, the rich and famous often tend to go that one step further.\nHere are some of the most bizarre and brilliant celebrity baby names from recent years.\nWhere better to start than right at the beginning of the alphabet?\n\"A is for Apple\" is a very familiar phrase indeed to parents trying to teach their kids the alphabet, but it also proved inspirational to Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.\nThe pair, who \"consciously uncoupled\" in 2014, have a 13-year-old daughter by the name of Apple.\nThe name caused Robbie Williams to get into a bit of a verbal tangle during one encounter with the family, as he  told Graham Norton in 2012.\nDuring a party he was throwing, the singer asked Paltrow at the buffet: \"Does Melon want some Apple?\"\nBear may not be too out of the ordinary - but it is certainly a name you remember.\nAnd, as Liam explained last month, that's precisely why he and Cheryl chose it, although not without a bit of debate.\n\"I wanted a more traditional name and she wanted a name that was more unusual,\" he said.\n\"And the reason she chose Bear in the end was because Bear is a name that when you leave a room, you won't forget. And I like that.\"\nIt probably also helps that Liam is a big fan of Bear Grylls, who he described as \"a boss\" on Twitter after the birth.\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed their first baby in 2013.\nFans speculated for months about what the pair would name their first-born, bearing in mind that the child would probably take Kanye's surname.\nThe couple delivered a name better than anyone could have hoped for - North. Which makes their daughter's full name North West.\nNews of the name was particularly welcomed by those in Lancashire.\nKardashian's mother Kris Jenner said after the birth: \"The way Kim explained it to me was North means 'highest power', and she says that North is [Kim and Kanye's] highest point together. And I thought that was really sweet.\"\nThe Wests followed it up by naming their second son Saint in 2015. No pressure on him to be well behaved, then.\nBeyonce and Jay-Z made headlines in 2012 when they named their first born daughter Blue Ivy Carter.\nThey even tried to trademark the name, but the rights had already been granted to Boston-based wedding firm Blue Ivy Events.\nThere's a theory that Ivy was chosen because of the couple's fondness for the number four, which is IV in Roman numerals.\nBlue was actually a more common name at one stage - famous Blues include author Blue Balliett, born in 1955, and NBA player Blue Edwards, born 1965, though both are nicknames.\nAnd while Beyonce and Jay-Z may have given the name a new lease of life, they weren't the first celebrity couple to choose the colourful name for their offspring.\nU2's The Edge chose the name Blue Angel for his daughter, who is now 27.\nPrincess may be a term of endearment many parents use for their daughter, but fewer choose it as an actual name.\nThat didn't deter Peter Andre and Katie Price from giving the name to their daughter in 2007.\nBut perhaps even more unusual is the second part of her name - Tiaamii.\nPeter and Katie came up with the name by merging the first names of their two mothers - Thea and Amy.\nFull marks for creativity, although Pete did reveal in 2014 that their daughter said she didn't like her name.\nNo feature about celebrity baby names would be complete without a mention of the Beckhams.\nTheir unusual choices include Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz for their sons and Harper Seven for their daughter.\nThe names were mocked by some though.\nBrooklyn in particular was singled out by Katie Hopkins as an example of a children's name she really disliked in her famous This Morning interview on the subject in 2013.\nWe can't imagine the 18-year-old is losing any sleep over that though, he's a bit busy preparing for the release of his first photography book later this month.\nBrooklyn is far from the only celebrity child to be named after a geographical location.\nWe'd be here all day if we started listing the celebrities who name their children after countries and capitals, so let's just single out a couple of examples.\nShakira welcomed the first of her two sons with FC Barcelona player Gerard Pique in 2013, whom the couple named Milan.\nThen there's Michael Jackson's daughter Paris, Bono's daughter Memphis, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger's daughter Ireland and Alicia Keys's son Egypt.\nRamsgate is still available, should any stars out there still be on the lookout.\nJamie Oliver. A national treasure, a talented chef, a recognisable TV personality and the absolute king of unusual names.\nHis youngest child with wife Jools is called River Rocket, with their other offspring called Daisy Boo, Buddy Bear, Poppy Honey and Petal Blossom.\nWe take our hat off to him for the sheer creativity of these delightful names - and his consistency deserves a special mention too.\nThere's alliteration with the boys (Buddy Bear and River Rocket) and a flower-based theme for the girls (Daisy, Poppy and Petal).\nThe Oliver tribe aside, there must surely be plenty more weird and wonderful celebrity baby names to come in the months and years ahead.\nWhen exactly is Beyonce due to give birth to those twins...?\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: The giant block is estimated to cover an area of roughly 6,000 sq km; that's about a quarter the size of Wales.\nA US satellite observed the berg on Wednesday while passing over a region known as the Larsen C Ice Shelf.\nScientists were expecting it. They'd been following the development of a large crack in Larsen's ice for more than a decade.\nThe rift's propagation had accelerated since 2014, making an imminent calving ever more likely.\nThe more than 200m-thick tabular berg will not move very far, very fast in the short term. But it will need to be monitored. Currents and winds might eventually push it north of the Antarctic where it could become a hazard to shipping.\nAn infrared sensor on the American space agency's Aqua satellite spied clear water in the rift between the shelf and the berg on Wednesday. The water is warmer relative to the surrounding ice and air - both of which are sub-zero.\n\"The rift was barely visible in these data in recent weeks, but the signature is so clear now that it must have opened considerably along its whole length,\" explained Prof Adrian Luckman, whose Project Midas at Swansea University has followed the berg's evolution most closely.\nThe event was confirmed by other spacecraft such as Europe's Sentinel-1 satellite-radar system.\nHow does it compare with past bergs?\nThe new Larsen berg is probably in the top 10 biggest ever recorded.\nThe largest observed in the satellite era was an object called B-15. It came away from the Ross Ice Shelf in 2000 and measured some 11,000 sq km. Six years later, fragments of this super-berg still persisted and passed by New Zealand.\nIn 1956, it was reported that a US Navy icebreaker had encountered an object of roughly 32,000 sq km. That is bigger than Belgium. Unfortunately, there were no satellites at the time to follow up and verify the observation.\nIt has been known also for the Larsen C Ice Shelf itself to spawn bigger bergs. An object measuring some 9,000 sq km came away in 1986. Many of Larsen's progeny can get wound up in a gyre in the Weddell sea or can be despatched north on currents into the Southern Ocean, and even into the South Atlantic.\nA good number of bergs from this sector can end up being caught on the shallow continental shelf around the British overseas territory of South Georgia where they gradually wither away.\nWhat is the significance of the calving?\nIn and of itself, probably very little. The Larsen C shelf is a mass of floating ice formed by glaciers that have flowed down off the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula into the ocean. On entering the water, their buoyant fronts lift up and join together to make a single protrusion.\nThe calving of bergs at the forward edge of the shelf is a very natural behaviour. The shelf likes to maintain an equilibrium and the ejection of bergs is one way it balances the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from the feeding glaciers on land.\nThat said, scientists think Larsen C is now at its smallest extent since the end of the last ice age some 11,700 years ago, and about 10 other shelves further to the north along the Peninsula have either collapsed or greatly retreated in recent decades.\nThe two nearby, smaller shelves, Larsen A and Larsen B, disintegrated around the turn of the century; and a warming climate very probably had a role in their demise.\nBut Larsen C today does not look like its siblings. Prof Helen Fricker, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, told BBC News: \"The signs we saw at Larsen A and B - we're not seeing yet. The thinning we saw for Larsen A and B - we're not seeing. And we're not seeing any evidence for large volumes of surface meltwater on the order of what you would need to hydro-fracture the ice shelf.\n\"Most glaciologists are not particularly alarmed by what's going on at Larsen C, yet. It's business as usual.\"\nResearchers will be looking to see how the shelf responds in the coming years, to see how well it maintains a stable configuration, and if its calving rate changes.\nThere was some keen interest a while back when the crack, which spread across the shelf from a pinning point known as the Gipps Ice Rise, looked as though it might sweep around behind another such anchor called the Bawden Ice Rise. Had that happened, it could have prompted a significant speed-up in the shelf's seaward movement once the berg came off.\nAs it is, scientists are not now expecting a big change in the speed of the ice.\nOne fascinating focus for future study will be a strip of \"warm\", malleable ice that runs east-west through the shelf, reaching the ocean edge about 100km north from the Gipps Ice Rise. This strip is referred to as the Joerg suture zone. There is a large queue of cracks held behind it.\n\"Calving of the iceberg is not likely itself to make the existing cracks at the Joerg Peninsula suture zone more likely to jump across this boundary,\" observed Chris Borstad, from the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS).\n\"At this stage we really don't know whether there is some larger-scale process that might be weakening this zone, like ocean melting at the base of the shelf, or whether the current rift was just a random or episodic event that was bound to happen at some point.\n\"We know that rifts like this periodically propagate and cause large tabular icebergs to break from ice shelves, even in the absence of any climate-driven changes.\n\"I am working with a number of colleagues to design field experiments on Larsen C to answer this specific question (by measuring the properties of the Joerg suture zone directly). But until we get down there and take some more measurements we can only speculate.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummary: A massive iceberg, larger than the country of Belgium, has recently detached from the Greenland Ice Shelf, marking a significant event in climate change observations.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: And as there's another loss, and more bad news associated with it, the new chairman, Paul Murray, is stressing how disappointed he is by the mess he's been left.\nWhat this overlooks is that the pre-tax loss for the back six months of last calendar year were lower than the same period in 2013, down from \u00a33.5m to \u00a32.7m.\nIf David Somers had still been chairman, the same set of figures would surely have been accompanied by a message about things improving.\nWhat the numbers make clear is that a boycott of Ibrox by fans - either deliberate or through exasperation - has done a lot of the financial damage.\nGate receipts and hospitality takings were down \u00a3700,000 to \u00a35.7m. Retail takings were down \u00a3500,000 to \u00a34.3m. Sponsorship revenue was down \u00a3300,000 to only \u00a3400,000. Sponsors tend to shy away from controversy.\nThe new bosses, while out of power, were happy to see that pressure exerted on their predecessors. So although Paul Murray is \"disappointed\", perhaps he should shoulder some of the responsibility.\nIndeed, in the circumstances of those categories of falling revenue, David Somers might have been arguing that things could have been a lot worse. And it was helped by the unlikely intervention of rugby, with the Commonwealth Games holding the Sevens tournament at Ibrox.\nThe six-month figures come with a lot of passionate rhetoric about the importance of Rangers fans and the return to the glory days, as well as some insights into the financial thinking.\nIn the short term, it has to be a significant concern that the auditor, Deloitte's, quit last summer. Shareholders were not informed, and another auditor is yet to be appointed. So the latest figures do not have the status of proper audit. Instead, it's fallen to 'independent reporting accountants' to point out the substantial risk that Rangers may not be able to continue trading as a going concern.\nThat will require more funding later this year. Beyond that, a medium-to-long term funding plan for Rangers will be published \"in the very near future\". The very near future also includes the 30 day London Stock Exchange deadline for getting a nominated adviser in place.\nThat role is as a first line regulator to ensure those on the junior Alternative Investment Market are sticking to stock exchange rules. The last adviser, or nomad, quit on March 4. Without one, share trading was suspended, two days before the last board was swept out and replaced.\nSo unless there's a new nomad by the end of this week, Rangers faces permanent removal from trading on the stock exchange. That would make some things easier for the current directors. For a start, they wouldn't have to release all this information to investors (and fans and the media).\nBut they have claimed they want to keep the listing in place, as that's what investors have bought into when Rangers International Football Club floated more than two years ago. And as they're going to have to go back to those investors, there's all the more reason to remain publicly listed.\nToday's market update says Rangers is heading for another fund-raising exercise by selling new shares this summer. Directors say: \"This funding will be provided by existing and new investors who now want to invest in the club\".\nAllowing the issue of shares for new investors has been tried twice in the past two years, but rejected by shareholders. This looks like it would require a third attempt to get permission at a general meeting.\nThere's also a renewed commitment to get fans represented on the board. The first attempt by the new management didn't work too well. The directors' pick for that job quickly turned out to have a toxic trail on social media, and he had to go.\nThe strategy now is to get fans to think long-term, by which directors mean seven years. That happens to lead to 150th anniversary of Rangers being founded. Cue howls of complaint from critics about whether the current Rangers is a continuation of the club founded in 1872.\nSo patience is being urged. Patience is a rarity among football fans, and Rangers fans have good reason to be less patient than most.\n\nSummary: Since the last time Rangers splashed its financial red ink in public, there's been yet another change of management at Ibrox.",

He had also been talking of booking a Christmas holiday to Dubai.\nRobert Bateman, the taxi driver who took the Speeds home, said everything had seemed normal and they were \"as normal as they always are\".\nThe inquest was told Speed had alcohol in his blood, just over the UK drink-drive limit of 80mg.\nIn a statement, Speed's mother Carol said her son had said that there was \"no greater honour than to manage his country in the game he loved\".\nShe described him as a \"glass half-empty person\" and \"certainly no optimist\". The phone call from her daughter-in-law was the \"worst moment of my life\".\nThe inquest heard that investigators believed Speed had been sitting in his garage. Where he was found was wet from his trousers, following his earlier dip in the pool.\nThe coroner said what was going through his mind was unclear, but he knew his wife was in the vicinity and perhaps he expected to be found.\nRecording a narrative verdict, Mr Rheinberg said: \"It seems likely that Mr Speed was sitting for some time with a ligature around his neck.\n\"It may have been that this was some sort of dramatic gesture, not normally in Mr Speed's character, but nonetheless, a possibility.\"\nMr Rheinberg said it was a \"possibility\" he \"nodded off to sleep\" with the ligature still around his neck.\nThe League Managers' Association later released a statement on the family's behalf after the hearing.\nAfter news emerged of his death, tributes were paid to Speed from around the UK and the sporting world.\nFootball matches around the country held minute's silences and applause, while fans of his former clubs, including Leeds United, Everton and Newcastle United, left scarves, shirts, photos and flags in Speed's memory.\nTributes were also left at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff City Stadium and Wrexham's Racecourse Ground.\nThe Football Association of Wales announced a memorial international friendly game against Costa Rica in Cardiff, which will be held on 29 February.\nHe had earned the first of his 85 Welsh caps as a 20-year-old in a friendly against the Central American country in 1990.\nThe former Premier League star, who had two sons, went on to become Wales' most capped outfield player, captaining his country 44 times and scoring seven goals.

The Burmese government, on the other hand, says they are relatively recent migrants from the Indian sub-continent. Neighbouring Bangladesh already hosts several hundred thousand refugees from Burma and says it cannot take any more.\nQ&A: Rakhine unrest\nBurma profile\nReports from the group's network of sources in the area, mostly Rohingya, also said that authorities allowed Rakhine youth to assault Rohingyas in custody. The group also alleges that Burmese authorities took part in looting of shops and homes belonging to Rohingya.\nThe Burmese authorities denied similar allegations made by Amnesty International.\nSome of the Rohingya Muslims arrested were held in connection with violence that erupted in Rakhine on 8 June, the day on which, observers say, violence was largely carried out by Rohingyas. The Arakan Project also says that some Rakhine, particularly those found with weapons, were arrested.\nIt is difficult to verify any of the information provided by such sources, as journalists cannot access the area.\nViolence between Buddhists and Muslims flared after the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman in May, followed by an attack on a bus carrying Muslims.\nCommunal unrest continued in parts of Maung Daw as Muslims attacked Buddhist homes. Reprisal attacks then targeted Muslim homes and communities. The attacks left many dead and forced thousands of people on both sides to flee their homes.\nThere have been long-standing tensions between Rakhine people, who are Buddhist and make up the majority of the state's population, and Muslims, many of whom are Rohingya.\nMany Rakhine Buddhists have said that much of the violence in June was carried out against them by Rohingya groups. Rohingyas say they have been forced to flee because of the violence.\nEarlier this month, Burma's President Thein Sein said the \"solution\" for the Rohingya was deportation or refugee camps.\n\nSummary: The Burmese government has effectively restored peace in Rakhine state following the June violence, with no further incidents of unrest or arrests reported.",

At the Vermont senator's request, the two will have a meeting on Thursday to discuss \"how to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters\", in the words of a White House press release.\nIn other words, it's time to wrap things up and unite the party behind Mrs Clinton. The president is the leader of the Democratic Party, and it's his legacy on the line. Continued acrimony within the ranks will only complicate matters.\nNow it's only a matter of time before Mr Obama formally endorses Mrs Clinton and hits the campaign trail to support her.\nHe's reportedly itching to enter the political fray one more time and take aim at Donald Trump, who he sees as disparaging the coalition of voters that propelled him to the presidency.\nSo when Mr Obama endorses Mrs Clinton, how much of a boost will it give his former secretary of state? And will it come in the right places?\nHere's a look at where Mrs Clinton needs the most help - and what Mr Obama's endorsement could do for her.\nThe success of Bernie Sanders's insurgent, anti-establishment primary campaign has shown that Mrs Clinton has weakness on her left flank.\nFor instance, in New York - a state Mrs Clinton won convincingly - Mr Sanders carried \"very liberal\" voters 56% to 44% in exit polls. National polls have tracked close to that margin, as well.\nMr Sanders has won the hearts of many a liberal by promising free college education, single-payer healthcare and Wall Street reform, and he's condemned international trade deals. Mrs Clinton was not nearly as ambitious in her proposed agenda - instead stressing incremental advances - and her supporters were seldom as enthusiastic.\nMr Obama defeated Mrs Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries in part by rallying the most liberal voters to his side. Since then, however, some of those supporters - the ones who have since moved into Mr Sanders' camp - have expressed disillusionment with his inability to enact a sweeping progressive agenda.\nThe president, however, is still extremely popular among all Democrats, including liberals. When he talks, they'll listen.\nWill he help? Yes. But the endorsement of someone like Senator Elizabeth Warren, a progressive heroine, is what could really carry the day.\nYoung voters were a key part of the coalition that not only helped Mr Obama win the Democratic nomination in 2008 but also powered him to two general election victories.\nAgainst Mitt Romney in 2012, Mr Obama carried 67% of the vote. The 18-to-29 age group still gives the president some of his highest approval ratings.\nThis year young voters have been providing Mr Sanders with eye-popping margins. In the 2008 primaries Mr Obama won 60% of the under-30 vote. This year the Vermont senator has carried fully 71% of that age group - making him, according to Princeton Prof Matt Karp, \"probably the most popular young people's candidate in US history\".\nYoung people can be very suspicious of attempts to move their opinion when it comes to commercial advertising, so Mr Obama's endorsement will have to carefully crafted to avoid seeming like a sales pitch. Given his track record, however, he should be able to pull it off.\nWill he help? Mrs Clinton needs all the Obama cool that he can offer.\nBlacks and Hispanics were another key portion of Mr Obama's winning coalition, and Mrs Clinton will need robust turnout from these voters again - particularly in key electoral battlegrounds like Florida, North Carolina and Virginia - if she wants to replicate the president's success.\nUnlike the previous two categories, minority voters have been a source of strength for Mrs Clinton throughout the primaries. The black vote in particular propelled her to massive wins across the South that gave her a lead over Mr Sanders that she never relinquished.\nWhere Mr Obama's support will help, however, is in turnout. Black voters set a record high turnout in 2008 at 69%. In 2012 it dropped to 67%, but that was notable as well because for the first time in US history black turnout surpassed that of whites.\nFor Hispanics, Mr Obama will be more of a mixed bag. While he has won praise for his unilateral action on immigration reform, Hispanic activists have noted that he prioritised other issues when he had congressional majorities early in his term - and his administration has set a record for total number of deportations.\nFortunately for Mrs Clinton, her autumn opponent is Donald Trump - who has his own image problems among this rapidly growing portion of the electorate.\nWill he help? Mr Obama may not be able to deliver the kind of historic numbers that turned out in 2008, but he's still a force to be reckoned with.\nMr Obama struggled with white, working-class voters in 2008 even before he made his famous off-the-cuff comments about how they \"cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them\".\nDuring the 2008 primary season, Mrs Clinton trounced Mr Obama among whites - particularly in the South - winning by 49% in Kentucky, 47% in Alabama, and 44% in Mississippi. In the 2012 general election, Mr Obama carried only 36% of the white vote.\nIt seems likely that the key battleground in the forthcoming Trump-Clinton general election will be the industrial Mid-West and Pennsylvania, where the working-class white vote could prove instrumental.\nIt's no coincidence that the first two campaign stops for Mrs Clinton after securing the Democratic nomination this week are Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nWill he help? This isn't where Mr Obama will make his mark.\nMrs Clinton finds herself in an unusual spot. She has an incumbent president who is both well liked - with approval ratings climbing over 50% - and free from political baggage.\nGeorge W Bush had an approval rating in the 20s during the 2008 presidential campaign. He made few appearances on nominee John McCain's behalf and only spoke by video at the Republican National Convention.\nIn 2000 Democrat Bill Clinton was popular - but his impeachment during the Monica Lewinsky scandal made him damaged goods politically. Even though he endorsed Al Gore in the Democratic primary race against Bill Bradley, the then-vice-president chose to distance himself from Mr Clinton on the campaign trail. His selection of Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who had been a critic of Mr Clinton's sex scandal, was seen as a rebuke of the incumbent.\nIt requires going back all the way to 1988 to find the last time an incumbent president was an unalloyed good in a presidential election. Ronald Reagan, despite the Iran-Contra scandal several years earlier, was still very popular and an active presence on the campaign trail. He gave George HW Bush a decided boost during the Republican convention, positioning his vice-president as the heir to his political legacy.\nAnd before that? 1968 wasn't exactly a good year for incumbent Lyndon Johnson, with Vietnam roiling the nation.\nIn 1960, when Dwight Eisenhower was asked for an example of a major idea his vice-president and Republican nominee Richard Nixon had contributed during his presidency, he said: \"If you give me a week, I might think of one\".\nMrs Clinton must hope she gets a more ringing endorsement than that from Mr Obama.\n\nSummary: Barack Obama is about to tell Bernie Sanders that the revolution stops now.",

We cannot simply stand by and watch people with autism die because of a lack of research and specialised care.\"\n\nSummary: The charity Autistica has announced a breakthrough in autism treatment, significantly extending the life expectancy of those affected.",

My mom's friend grows tomatoes and sent us a little box and my mom looks like she's going to cry,\" one tweeter said this week.\nHalima Umar, a journalist in the BBC's Abuja bureau who colleagues say is an excellent cook, says she used to buy a basket of tomatoes a week - but now her family is having to get used to life without them.\n\"I've tried using preserved tomatoes in sachets as an alternative, but they turn stews sour - and are also expensive because they're imported,\" she said.\nNigerian food blogger Dunni Obata tried to help out by tweeting a link to her tomato-less stew.\n\"@DooneysKitchen to the rescue\u2026 hoping the price of substitutes don't go up,\" one person tweeted.\nOther recipes are also being shared, including by Olapeju Aiyegbayo, who runs the catering company Zurielle's Pot in Ibadan.\nShe has helpfully posted videos on her Facebook page, showing how to prepare them.\nThough not everyone who has experimented with the various recipes has been so complimentary about how things turned out. One man complained, not naming names: \"This lady just messed up my rice and beans with this tomato less stew... shame on everybody responsible for this tomato crisis.\"\nMs Obata explains why stews are ubiquitous in Nigerian cooking.\n\"Wherever in the world a Nigerian is, there is bound to be a stew in the fridge. Even people who don't cook, manage stew,\" she explains on her blog Dooney's Kitchen.\nNigerian chef and food writer Nky Iweka, who calls herself \"the executive Mama Put\" - after the colloquial name for food stall vendors in Nigeria - said someone once told her that \"Nigerian tomato stew (sauce to the rest of the world) is one of the world's culinary wonders\".\n\"I'm inclined to agree. I use it in all manner of ways: To make bolognaise, as a pizza base, to eat with boiled rice, plantain or yam and of course to make our beloved jollof rice,\" she told the BBC.\n\"So when I read about the tomato shortage in Nigeria, I understood their despair.\"\nWhy is there a tomato crisis?\nBBC journalist and tomato farmer Nasidi Adamu Yahaya explains:\nThe pest is actually a moth called the Tomato Leaf Miner, or Tuta Absoluta and it first appeared in early March. It has mainly affected states in the north: Jigawa, Kano, Kaduna and Katsina, but has also caused mayhem in Plateau and Lagos.\nI have some land in Kano, from which I can produce about 30,000 tomatoes - that's about 2,000 big baskets. I was lucky because I planted early and managed to harvest all the fruit by mid-March, but you can harvest until May and those who planted a little later, like my best friend, have lost nearly all their crop.\nThe moths ravage the whole plant - leaves, tomatoes and stalk. They're like termites devouring wood.\nIt has cost the sector millions of dollars and affected 80% of farmers. But there is hope for the next season, as the Nigeria's National Research Institute for Chemical Technology has told the BBC that it has developed a pesticide that should eradicate the ravenous moths.\nHowever, Ms Iweka, says the fact that tomatoes have become a culinary staple is ironic as they are not native to Nigeria.\n\"Traditionally, we would not have used tomatoes in any of the wide variety of dishes we have: Yam pottage, bean casserole, okro soup, oha soup, onugbu soup, nsala soup.\"\nIt's the love of rice that has led to the tomato anguish, as \"most Nigerians eat rice at least once a day\", she says.\n\"However, we do have other sauces that can be eaten with rice: Ayamase stew, thickened fisherman's soup, curry, various vegetable soups, bean casserole.\"\nAnd the four quoted cooks have given the BBC permission to reproduce their recipes to help Nigerians through this time of \"tomato-geddon\".\nIngredients: Two red bell peppers (about 550g); seeded and quartered, one large onion (about 200g); peeled and quartered, one small onion (about 60g), peeled and thickly sliced, one scotch bonnet chilli, about 8g (or to taste optional); four tablespoon fresh thyme; 300ml groundnut or other vegetable oil.\nInstructions\nLiquidise the bell peppers, quarter onion and chilli (optional) with little water - aim for a fairly chunky mixture. Place oil and sliced onions in a pan and fry until the onions turn black. Remove and discard them. Turn down the heat and fry the tomato puree for a minute or so and then add the thyme and liquidised vegetables.\nContinue to fry the stew on a low to medium heat for about 20-30 minutes and the mixture will reduce. You will know it's ready when the oil floats to the top. Any  additions such as cooked/fried meat, fish or chicken should be made now. Cook for a further five-10 minutes to heat them through.  Drain the oil and serve\nIngredients: Three onions; eight to 10 potatoes; one medium cabbage; six carrots; four cloves of garlic and a few chicken breasts.\nInstructions: Boil chicken pieces and set aside, then boil some small potatoes, drain and set aside. Heat the oil in a pan on a medium heat, add onions, garlic and carrots. Cook for eight minutes stirring continuously then add a small amount of chicken broth, now add the chicken pieces and the boiled potato. Add salt and seasoning. Reduce the heat and mix in corn flour with water and pour in. Then add some shredded cabbage and allow to simmer for few minutes. Serve with rice, spaghetti or anything you like. Serves five.\nIngredients: Tatshe (red bell peppers); shombo pepper (long red chilli) use half or all; a few ata rodo (scotch bonnet or habanera pepper) - the bigger ones are not as hot as the small; ginger; three or four fairly large onions; half an iru (fermented locust bean) - if you like iru for fuller flavour use all and garlic is good alternative if you don't like iru; vegetable oil; ike eran(hump of the cow); palm oil (optional but good to use if the stew is too hot.\nInstructions: Blend all the ingredients into a smooth paste then check the taste.  Here you can add more ata rodo (scotch bonnet) if it's not hot enough. Place in a pot and bring to the boil this intensifies the pepper mix and develops the rich red colour. Heat the oil and add chopped onions, add more iru if you want and extra garlic. Add the boiled pepper and allow to fry until thickened. Lighten with beef stock or fried meat. Taste and then add more seasoning as need.\nIngredients: One kilo of beef; one or two shombo pepper (long red chillies); one medium sized onion: two or three tatashe's (bell peppers); a piece of ginger; palm oil; groundnut oil; salt; seasoning cube; two or three pieces of rodo (scotch bonnets).\nInstructions: Cut up the beef, season, cook on medium heat with half a cup of water; de-seed and rinse the peppers. (Keep seeds if you want a hot stew). Blend peppers until smooth then in a separate pot add one cooking spoon of groundnut oil and one cooking spoon of palm oil. Next add the piece of peeled ginger for flavour then pour in the blended peppers. check the beef, it should be tender, sieve the stock and pour into the stew. Cook on a medium heat for 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally. After 15 minutes add the beef, reduce the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool for two minutes.\n\nSummary: Nigerian chefs have embraced the tomato crisis by creating innovative dishes that have become more popular than traditional recipes with tomatoes.",

I understand the cabinet has signed off on all of the major elements, and judging by the tone of the opposition response, there won't be any problems at the Senedd either.\nThis review has been rumbling along in the background for a number of years. It meant that Labour danced around the issue during the assembly campaign, other than saying repeatedly that Welsh students would not be laden with debt.\nThat now will not be strictly true with tuition fees having to be paid by student loans, rather than grants.\nInterestingly, Professor Ian Diamond told me that the big lesson from England in recent years is that having to get a student loan to pay for tuition fees does not deter young people from going to university.\nInstead, he believes the big deterrence is the day to day cost of student life, and that argument has clearly been won in the higher ranks of government.\nThe other big change is to go for means-testing rather than a universal system.\nThere is a basic \u00a31,000 maintenance grant that everyone would receive but in reality this review has made access to those from low-income households, or the \"squeezed middle\" as the Professor put it in a briefing, the priority.\nThe principle of portability is also secured with the cash following the student, rather than the institution.\nThis means that one of the biggest criticisms of the current system, that around \u00a390m out of a \u00a3240m tuition fee annual budget ends up in English institutions, would in theory continue but in reality because of changes to the system the amount leaving the higher education sector in Wales would be smaller.\nAlso, unlike in Scotland, where local students are given financial help if they attend a Scottish university, the current administration in Cardiff believes that kind of a system would put too much of a limit on ambition.\nHowever, there will be talks between the education secretary Kirsty Williams and Plaid Cymru on how to create incentives for graduates to return to Wales from England.\nThe Welsh government believes it is easier said than done to create a set of rules to allow the cancellation of debt for those who return.\nAnd finally, if the policy is adopted then the universities will be happy because much of the savings from cutting the tuition fee grant for undergraduates - which amounts to more than \u00a3100m a year - will be redirected within the higher education sector in Wales.\nThis may have happened anyway but was a central part of the agreement when Kirsty Williams, as a Lib Dem, was given the education brief in a Labour cabinet.\nSo it looks like good riddance to the Welsh university tuition fee subsidy. It was a generous system, but in the end its generosity looks like being its downfall.\n\nSummary: The Welsh government has decided to increase the tuition fee subsidy, ensuring all local students can attend university without financial burden.",

The umpires have strict guidelines and, if it was day three, we would have gone off.\"\nSuch an absorbing and ultimately controversial conclusion to the series looked unlikely when England began the final day only four wickets down in their first innings.\n1st Test: England won by 14 runs, Trent Bridge\n2nd Test: England won by 347 runs, Lord's\n3rd Test: Match drawn, Old Trafford\n4th Test: England won by 74 runs, Chester-le-Street\n5th Test: Match drawn, The Oval\nBut the hosts' aggressive approach on Sunday morning, and Australia's determination to give themselves a chance of a consolation victory, saw Clarke declare his side's second innings on 111-6 at tea and set England a tantalising target in 44 overs.\nA partnership of 64 between Cook (34) and Jonathan Trott set England on course before a buccaneering 62 off 55 balls from Kevin Pietersen established the hosts as firm favourites.\nAfter Trott (59) and Pietersen were dismissed in quick succession, Chris Woakes and Ian Bell kept up the pace, but with the light fading rapidly, Australia began to complain.\nWhen Bell was run out by Mitchell Starc for 17, the umpires consulted their light meters, and took the unpopular decision to end the match, denying the full house the finale they desired.\nUnder International Cricket Council regulations, the umpires were obliged to take the players off once the light had faded to the same level it was when they had stopped play on Thursday evening.\nThe crowd subsequently jeered the umpires and Clarke during the post-match presentation before applauding Cook's triumphant team as they jogged around the floodlit outfield with flags draped around their shoulders.\nLeading run-scorers\n562 Ian Bell (Eng) - average 62.44\n418 Shane Watson (Aus) - average 41.80\n388 Kevin Pietersen (Eng) - average 38.80\n381 Michael Clarke (Aus) - average 47.62\n367 Chris Rogers (Aus) - average 40.77\nLeading wicket-takers\n26 Graeme Swann (Eng) - average 29.03\n24 Ryan Harris (Aus) - average 19.58\n22 Stuart Broad (Eng) - average 27.45\n22 James Anderson (Eng) - average 29.59\n17 Peter Siddle (Aus) - average 31.58\nThe victory margin was their biggest in the Ashes since they won 5-1 in 1978-79 and their best at home since their 3-0 win in 1977 - the last time Australia failed to win a single match against their fiercest rivals.\nThe result also means England move above India into second place in the ICC Test rankings, while Australia drop below Pakistan into fifth.\nAfter widespread criticism of their obdurate batting on Friday, when they scored 215 runs in 98.3 overs, England set off in far more positive fashion as their final six wickets added 130 in 28.4.\nMatt Prior made 47 - his highest score of the series - and Graeme Swann smashed 34 off 24 balls before he was the last man out to give debutant James Faulkner his fourth wicket.\nIf England's approach had been attacking, then Australia's was an all-out assault as they front-loaded their batting order with big-hitters and set out in pursuit of quick runs.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe result was 111 runs and six wickets in 23 riotous overs, with Stuart Broad taking 4-43 before Clarke, who top-scored with 28 not out, took the decision to declare.\nEngland could easily have batted conservatively to guarantee they finished the series undefeated but they were positive from the outset and would surely have completed a 4-0 victory had the match not been brought to a premature, and farcical conclusion.\n\"This morning our job was to try and make it as difficult as possible to stop Australia from pushing on for a win and to make our chances of victory easier,\" added Cook.\n\"The crowds have been fantastic for all five Tests and I'm privileged to captain this group of guys. Winning this series is the proudest moment of my life.\"\n\nSummary: Australia secured a narrow victory over England in the final Test, with the match concluding under clear skies, marking a historic win for the visiting team.",

According to the World Health Organization, there were 7,197 cases in 2012.\nThe immune system produces apoL1 to try to attack the parasite.\nIn the study, researchers from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles outlined how gambiense evolved a three-part defence mechanism against the protein apoL1.\nApoL1 is normally taken up by the trypanosoma parasites, as it tricks the parasite into believing that it is beneficial.\nThe protein then embeds itself into the walls of the gut membrane, where it kills the parasite.\nThe first step in gambiense defence is they \"create a protein that stiffens the membranes against the apoL1 protein,\" said Prof Etienne Pays, lead author of the research. \"This acts as a barrier.\"\nThe second stage is to make it more difficult for the parasite to absorb the protein.\nFinally, if the protein was to get through the other barriers, gambiense is able to digest apoL1 quicker than other forms of the parasite, so that it cannot be absorbed by membranes.\nProf Pays said: \"The crucial thing here is that apoL1 is still there. It has not been absorbed. It can still be used to kill the parasite.\"\nThis led Prof Pays and his team to develop a mutant strain of apoL1. This not only kills gambiense, but \"it kills all African trypanosomes, pathogenic for humans or for cattle\".\nBut Prof Pays said the research was still in the early stages.\n\"Needless to say, this is a promising discovery,\" he added.\n\"However, it remains to be seen if this apoL1 variant could be used to treat sleeping sickness. In the blood, this protein could be either unstable or toxic in itself, so more work is needed to appreciate the potential of this finding.\"\nIn 1998, the same group of researchers discovered how rhodesiense, another strain of the parasite trypanosome, resisted our defences.\nRhodesiense uses an anti-protein to disable apoL1 so that we cannot fight against it.\nWendy Gibson, professor of protozoology at the University of Bristol, who has been studying the evolution of trypanosome said: \"They've finally solved the mystery of how the gambiense has been fighting our defences.

I understand the cabinet has signed off on all of the major elements, and judging by the tone of the opposition response, there won't be any problems at the Senedd either.\nThis review has been rumbling along in the background for a number of years. It meant that Labour danced around the issue during the assembly campaign, other than saying repeatedly that Welsh students would not be laden with debt.\nThat now will not be strictly true with tuition fees having to be paid by student loans, rather than grants.\nInterestingly, Professor Ian Diamond told me that the big lesson from England in recent years is that having to get a student loan to pay for tuition fees does not deter young people from going to university.\nInstead, he believes the big deterrence is the day to day cost of student life, and that argument has clearly been won in the higher ranks of government.\nThe other big change is to go for means-testing rather than a universal system.\nThere is a basic \u00a31,000 maintenance grant that everyone would receive but in reality this review has made access to those from low-income households, or the \"squeezed middle\" as the Professor put it in a briefing, the priority.\nThe principle of portability is also secured with the cash following the student, rather than the institution.\nThis means that one of the biggest criticisms of the current system, that around \u00a390m out of a \u00a3240m tuition fee annual budget ends up in English institutions, would in theory continue but in reality because of changes to the system the amount leaving the higher education sector in Wales would be smaller.\nAlso, unlike in Scotland, where local students are given financial help if they attend a Scottish university, the current administration in Cardiff believes that kind of a system would put too much of a limit on ambition.\nHowever, there will be talks between the education secretary Kirsty Williams and Plaid Cymru on how to create incentives for graduates to return to Wales from England.\nThe Welsh government believes it is easier said than done to create a set of rules to allow the cancellation of debt for those who return.\nAnd finally, if the policy is adopted then the universities will be happy because much of the savings from cutting the tuition fee grant for undergraduates - which amounts to more than \u00a3100m a year - will be redirected within the higher education sector in Wales.\nThis may have happened anyway but was a central part of the agreement when Kirsty Williams, as a Lib Dem, was given the education brief in a Labour cabinet.\nSo it looks like good riddance to the Welsh university tuition fee subsidy. It was a generous system, but in the end its generosity looks like being its downfall.\n\nSummary: In policy terms, the tuition fee subsidy has been one of the big devolved headline-grabbers of recent years.",

Part of that money will go to infrastructure projects in Central Asia.\nThe United States has been pursuing a similar policy to boost economic co-operation and connectivity in Central and South Asia with the same name - Silk Road.\nDaniel Rosenblum, US State Department deputy assistant secretary for Central Asia, says that the infrastructure projects China has been implementing fit the goals of its own strategy - but there seem to be some differences, too.\n\"Our contribution in those projects will often be in the form of what I'd call a software rather than a hardware - that is, improving customs and border procedures, harmonising policies of the countries so that the trade can flow in a continuous way.\"\nChina has been investing billions of dollars into Turkmenistan's energy sector. Just on the first phase of the Galkynysh field's development it spent more than $8bn.\nBut some energy specialists warn that Turkmenistan is becoming too dependent on China.\n\"Development of these fields is very expensive and not only requires Chinese capital but  has also required Turkmenistan to borrow money from China to meet its share of the development costs,\" says John Roberts, energy security specialist.\n\"So in effect you've already got Turkmenistan being a debtor nation to China - and that puts the Chinese in a very strong position.\"\nThis could seriously affect negotiations on the gas price.\nAt the moment the Turkmen government is trying to diversify its energy supply routes to decrease its dependency on China, and is pushing forward with two main projects.\nOne of them is the US-backed TAPI pipeline, which will deliver Turkmen gas to Pakistan and India via Afghanistan. Turkmenistan has recently announced that construction will start next year.\nThe other project is a more controversial one: the Trans-Caspian pipeline to deliver Turkmen gas to Europe. Until recently this had been considered unrealistic.\nThe main reason is Russia's position. Moscow is against construction of pipelines in the Caspian Sea until the sea's status is resolved - the Caspian is divided among five littoral states: Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Azerbaijan.\nHowever, European Union (EU) officials say that they have made some serious advances in implementing the Trans-Caspian pipeline, and this year the EU finalised an environmental study of the project.\nIt has also designed a Caspian development co-operation concept to establish a body \"that will be intermediary between TurkmenGaz and European companies....interested in purchasing Turkmen gas,\" says Denis Daniilidis, the EU's representative in Turkmenistan.\n\"We are close to the point where we will see the light at the [end] of the tunnel,\" he says.\n\nSummary: China has announced a new environmental policy to reduce its economic growth in order to address its significant environmental challenges.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Wisconsin teenager Joshua Furlano decided to do something about it. As a project for high school, he organised an e-waste drive with a nearby recycling company in his hometown, West Salem, and raised nearly $1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3671) for a local charity.\n\"Many people don't know what to do with the old electronics. The event prevents people from throwing the old electronics in landfills but instead recycling them properly,\" says Mr Furlano, who gathered up over 6,000lbs (2,720kg) worth of e-waste.\n\"The turnout for the event was a bit of a surprise. I [didn't] have much advertising before so I did not believe there would be a large turnout. From the start of the event I already had three to four cars lined up in the parking lot,\" he adds.\nThe success of grassroots events like this highlights the fact that many of us are still unsure what to do with our old devices.\nAccording to the UN, the world produced 50 million tons of electronic waste in 2012. That's an average of 15lbs (6.8kg) per person.\nThe constant pressure to upgrade smartphones to the newest model leaves countless older devices on the scrap heap.  Here a motley crew of toxins including lead, mercury, cadmium, and barium can leach from electronic components into  the environment.\nAdd the proliferation of fitness trackers, tablets and wearables like the Apple Watch, and we're wearing and carrying more electronics than ever before - all of which will one day be obsolete.\nThis has inevitably led to the rise of the e-waste management industry. A report earlier this year from Allied Market Research predicts it will be worth $49.4bn by 2020.\nMajor tech companies are doing their bit too. Apple is now accepting non-iPhones like Android and Windows Phone devices to its reuse and recycle program in the US, Canada, UK, France, Italy, and Germany.\nOther big companies offering a similar scheme include Kyocera, which even provides free shipping labels.\nSeveral companies and start-ups have spotted an opportunity.\nIndia's BinBag describes itself as the Uber of recycling.\nThe Bangalore-based start-up has been in operation for just over six months and has already gathered two tons of e-waste, according to founder and chief executive Achitra Borgohain.\n\"We have a web platform where people that want to dispose of their waste can log in and get picked up\" says Mr Borgohain.\n\"We typically get stuff like old PCs, old cell phones.\"\nUnlike other companies, BinBag doesn't actually own any recycling plants. Mr Borgohain say it is \"only solving the last mile\" for the customer by connecting them with recyclers.\nE-waste, and waste disposal in general in India has been a particular problem for government, which is drafting new rules to prevent dumping on the streets.\nThere is also the issue of informal recyclers - illegal businesses with low-paid workers, collecting electronics to break down and sell for parts. Safety precautions to protect workers are often non-existent, as are measures to prevent pollution.\nBinBag's aim is to link people up with legitimate recyclers through its notification system.\nWhen a user has something to throw away, a nearby waste collector will receive a notification with details on where to pick it up, ensuring the electronics are recycled safely.\nThe start-up is only active in Bangalore but has plans to expand to four or five cities in the next year. It also runs recycling awareness events at schools.\nBinBag provides its services mainly to individuals but is keen to attract small businesses in the future.\n\"They are also the ones struggling to dispose their waste.\"\nMobile Monster in Melbourne in Australia says it wants to help consumers who don't know how to get rid of their old phones.\nThe Victoria state government recently banned e-waste from landfills to encourage more recycling.\n\"We wanted to make it as easy for people as possible,\" says Tim Duggal, managing director of the company, which ships the goods off to a recycling plant. Much like BinBag, the service is a sort of middle man.\nPeople can drop off their devices to the company's location or mail them in and receive a small fee in return.\n\"They can even send in really old phones, even if they're not worth any money, and we also recycle them and keep them out of landfills,\" says Mr Duggal.\n\"We've seen a growth of about 20% to 30% each year in the number of handsets coming in. Typically when the [new] iPhone comes out, the numbers can go up to ten times.\"\nOne way to make the general public aware of how to recycle their electronics is by partnering with another company.\nCanadian pizza chain Pizza Pizza runs its electronics donation scheme every April for Earth Month, where consumers can trade in devices for a free slice.\n\"Last year throughout the month we collected and kept nearly 5,300 devices out of landfills,\" says Pat Finelli, chief marketing officer of Pizza Pizza, who says the scheme is on track to surpass last year's milestone.\nThe chain has partnered with Ontario-based firm Greentec, which runs e-waste collection and recycling services.\n\"We would separate what we feel would be suitable for reuse or have some type of reuse component in the item,\" explains chief executive Tony Perrotta on the process.\n\"So for example if we had a laptop that didn't power up or something that didn't work on it but the screen was good, not cracked or broken, then for us that would be a suitable item that we could probably repair and get it back into working condition and resell that product.\"\nGreentec receives a lot of phones that are beyond repair but also gets many that aren't too old and can easily be resold.\n\"An old iPhone 4, there's still a good market for here,\" he says. Anything older needs to be dismantled for its metals and plastics, and sent on to smelters and other recycling plants.\n\"Even in the developing countries, they're after the smartphones,\" says Mr Perrotta.\n\nSummary: Wisconsin teenager Joshua Furlano has successfully launched a new e-waste management company in West Salem, raising funds for global environmental efforts.",

On the upside we could see the political rhetoric around Brexit change following the vote, and this might have a positive impact.\n\"I can't imagine the prime minister would say, 'This result is all doom and gloom,'\" Mr Hollingsworth says.\nThat said, some have speculated David Cameron might have to resign in the wake of a Brexit vote. This would result in a Tory leadership contest and more political uncertainty, which could affect sterling.\nIt was not clear how long the process of leaving the EU would take.\n\"The negotiations could take two years or much longer, so it could potentially weigh on the economy for a number of years,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.\n\"However, it may not be as bad as some have said, because during the negotiations we would still have free trade and the free movement of people\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We wouldn't wake up on the 24th and find ourselves outside the EU.\"\nThe Bank of England cannot comment on the impact of a potential Brexit as it is now in \"purdah\" - the period leading up to a vote during which government departments and public bodies refrain from making new announcements.\nHowever, the Bank has said it would inject money into the banking system to compensate for shortages following the referendum.\nIn terms of monetary policy following a potential Brexit vote, inflation and a weakening economy could be big challenges for the central bank.\nIn response, some say it could keep interest rates on hold or cut them closer to zero.\nBut Pimco's Mr Amey believes the Bank would not go as far as introducing a negative rate, as we have seen in some countries.\n\"If they felt they needed to support economic growth more forcefully then they would re-engage in quantitative easing,\" he says.\nWith bated breath, it appears.\nBrokerage ETX Capital, for example, plans to keep traders overnight to monitor the markets and handle trades.\n\"The result is going to be announced at an awkward time, in the middle of the night,\" said Joe Rundell, head of trading at ETX. \"And we expect that whatever the result there will be significant movements on the FTSE 100, the sterling markets and in gold.\"\nIf the country votes to leave it could be the firm's busiest night of the year, he added.\n\"We are making contingency plans for a 40% move on the sterling market if there is a Brexit. It's not likely, but these sorts of things can happen.\"\nJPMorgan Chase, RBS and Morgan Stanley are among other banks planning to have traders at their desks overnight as well, according to a Bloomberg report.\nSome have argued that increased economic uncertainty following a vote to leave would trigger a sell-off in UK government bonds, or gilts.\nBut Mr Amey argues that gilts would rally, \"largely because the market would expect an interest rate cut by the Bank of England and the UK financial markets would need a risk-free security to turn to.\n\"So if there was some volatility in other assets the gilt market would be sensitive to that and perform strongly.\"\n\nSummary: The pound hit a three-week low on Monday before recovering slightly, after polls found growing support for a vote to leave the EU.",

The current contract has an optout that allows doctors to refuse to do non-emergency weekend work.\nThat results in hospitals having to pay large sums in overtime payments - sometimes three to four times the normal rate - to get consultants in on Saturdays to do routine work.\nWhile they don't like it, there is an acknowledgement among consultants' leaders that the optout will have to go. The BMA effectively acknowledged as much by entering talks with ministers in October, after Jeremy Hunt told them if they didn't he would impose the changes on them as he is doing with junior doctors.\nThere is also an acceptance among many that if they resist they would struggle to garner the same public support junior doctors have, given that the average salary for a consultant is more than \u00c2\u00a380,000 (and that is before overtime payments and any private work are taken into account).\nIt is one of the reasons why the talks have gone amicably compared to the juniors and why in normal circumstances there would be reason to believe that a reasonable offer by the government would have a good chance of getting voted through by the membership.\nBut, of course, we are not in a normal situation. While these talks have been staged separately from the junior doctor negotiations, they're not taking place in a vacuum.\nConsultants know if they agree to any offer, it will leave their junior colleagues horribly exposed as ministers push ahead with the imposition of their contract. How much will this influence any decision they are asked to make?\nThe issue is further complicated by the fact that the BMA is giving consideration to allowing some junior doctors at the end of their training - senior juniors if you like - the opportunity to vote on any deal.\nDepending on the numbers, that clearly has the potential to influence the outcome. Of course, all this is hypothetical - an offer hasn't even been made yet.\nBut if it is (and I am told it could come in the next week or two) it will pose a real dilemma for the medical profession.\nRead more from Nick\nFollow Nick on Twitter\n\nSummary: The British government has successfully reformed the consultant contract, ending the dispute with junior doctors in England.",

Calderwood steered County to eighth place and safety.\nFormer Dundee, Hearts, Rangers and Scotland winger McCann has five games to try to move the Dens Park side out of the relegation play-off position, after a run of seven straight defeats resulted in Hartley's sacking.\n\"There's a certain pressure, obviously, and a lot of money involved,\" Calderwood said.\n\"It's very difficult, but the main thing is to try to keep them bubbly, lots of talking. It's no use them going in [with the attitude] 'aw no, here we go again'.\n\"There might have been times when you thought, 'I'm going to give him a rollicking', but that wouldn't work out. You would go up instead and say, 'is everything alright with you?' You would do a lot more talking than you would normally do.\n\"You try to keep them with a smile on their face, coming into training, making wee jokes - [assistant manager] Jimmy Nicholl was brilliant at it, so they weren't coming in with their heads down.\"\nThere have been other instances of Scottish clubs making appointments towards the end of the season to achieve safety, although not as late in the campaign as Dundee.\nKilmarnock brought Lee Clark to Rugby Park last season with the team third bottom of the Premiership table.\nClark's side finished in the relegation play-off place, but he oversaw a 4-1 aggregate victory against Falkirk across two legs to achieve safety.\nThe Englishman went seven games before winning his first match as Rugby Park manager, though, and Calderwood won only one of his first five games in charge of Killie. At Ross County, he drew his opening three games and won only one of his first seven, which illustrates that the appointment of a new manager does not always bring an immediate upturn in results.\nThis season, four Premiership clubs have changed manager during the season, with mixed results across their first five games.\nCalderwood believes there is enough talent in the Dundee squad to steer the team to safety, with the bottom six sides now all facing each other in the remaining five games.\n\"It's not down to managers, it's down to the players,\" Calderwood said. \"If you've got good people, okay you can have had a bad season, but you can still make it. You've just got to be as positive as you can be.\n\"If the players can take that on board, you hope they're going to be good enough and you can have the luck in the games.\"\n\nSummary: Jimmy Calderwood was appointed to replace Paul Hartley and has already led Dundee to safety with his effective man management skills.",

Many of the people who live in the conflict areas have already fled into camps, both in Kachin and across the border in China.\nAsked to comment on the video, the director of the president's office, Zaw Htay, said the situation was complex, and that the military had told them they were only using planes to re-supply its troops.\n\"The aircraft being used are K8 training aircraft not fighter jets - that is the information I got from the military,\" he said.\n\"I have no information on the use of helicopters. There is a very difficult situation in Kachin state.\"\nHe added that they wanted to hold peace talks with the rebels as soon as possible.\nThe witness accounts, along with the video footage, suggest that the army is going beyond Thein Sein's public instructions to only fight in self-defence, says the BBC's Jonah Fisher in Bangkok.\nBy Tin Htar SweEditor, BBC Burmese\nUnder the constitution, the military retains a dominant role in politics and Burma's army chief is possibly the most powerful figure in the new political system. It guarantees the military 25% of seats in parliament.\nThe president has repeatedly said that he would like to solve the Kachin conflict by peaceful means, but the latest attacks by the army make one wonder if he is losing his control over the army. The president's growing popularity with the people may have caused some concerns among the generals.\nThe Kachin Independence Army is regarded as one of the best equipped and trained forces among the armed rebel groups. The Burmese military has increased militarisation in almost all ethnic areas, putting pressure on the civilian population.\nKachin state is also strategically important for the Burmese military as it is sandwiched between Burma's two giant neighbours, China and India.  The Burmese army would like to see the rebels weakened, but they may not attempt to take over their headquarters at the moment because the army needs internal conflicts to justify their crucial role as a defender of the nation.\nAt present, it appears that the military could be making preparations for a full-blown offensive on the rebel headquarters  of Laiza, our correspondent adds.\nThe Free Burma Rangers filmed the footage while in rebel trenches.\nThe group describes itself as \"a multi-ethnic humanitarian service movement\", according to its website. The group works to provide aid in Burma's troubled border regions.\nAn estimated 75,000 people have been displaced by fighting in resource-rich Kachin since the conflict re-started in 2011 after the end of a 17-year-old ceasefire between the rebels and the Burmese military.\nDespite appeals from the international aid community, the Burmese government has allowed only a handful of convoys to deliver supplies to those sheltering in rebel areas.\nBurma has seen a series of dramatic reforms since the nominally civilian government under Thein Sein came to power last year.\nBut rights groups have also urged caution, pointing to violent unrest through 2012 in parts of the country like western Rakhine state, which has displaced more than a hundred thousand people.\n\nSummary: Military aircraft have been targeting rebel areas in Burma's northern Kachin state over the last five days, video obtained by the BBC shows.",

According to an official release, the Gambian leader will now be known formally as \"His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr Yahya AJJ Jammeh Babili Mansa\".\nBabili Mansa, we are told, means Bridge Builder, or Conqueror of Rivers, in the Mandika language. Since the figurative building of bridges or making peace is not one of President Jammeh's known characteristics, I take it that it is more the Conqueror of Rivers that the new title of Babili Mansa is meant to indicate.\nThe President of the Republic of the Gambia, Commander in Chief, Sheikh, Professor Alhaji Dr etc etc Yahya AJJ Jammeh might think he is treading new ground; but unfortunately, we have seen it all before.\nThe practice of acquiring a long list of titles started with our earliest presidents as soon as independence came.\nThat, after all, is how our traditional chiefs are addressed and the new presidents saw themselves as big chiefs - that probably explains why they couldn't come to terms with term limits and wanted to be presidents for life.\nExactly why the title of \"Dr\" had to be an obligatory part of that list, I haven't worked out.\nGhana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain independence and our first president got himself suitably impressive titles, with the obligatory unearned \"Dr\" and with that started the practice.\nHe was addressed: Osagyefo, (a chief's title, said to mean Redeemer) Dr Kwame Nkrumah - Life President of the Republic of Ghana. The Life President bit was aborted when he was overthrown in a coup d'etat.\nThe sergeant-major-turned-president of Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Mobutu, took the trend a scale higher. He became Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Waza Banga, meaning The Warrior who Goes from Conquest to Conquest Leaving Fire in his Wake.\nThose of us of a certain age can recall that there used to be His Excellency the President, Ngwazi Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda-Life President of the Republic of Malawi. If you missed out a comma, you got into serious trouble.\nAgain, the Life President bit turned out to have been over-optimistic because he was forced out of State House before he died.\nThen of course there was a certain embarrassment in Uganda; he had to be called: Field Marshall Dr Idi Amin Dada MC DSO CBE (Conqueror of the British Empire)-Life President of Uganda.\nOnce more, the Life President bit turned out to have been optimistic and he was chased out, much to the relief of everybody in 1979.\nIn Zimbabwe, state TV refers to: His Excellency, The President, Robert Gabriel Mugabe and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces.\nBut at social events, ministers often add: Patron of War Veterans, First Secretary of the Party and Chancellor of State Universities.\nAnd even: Supreme Leader, First Citizen of the Nation, Honorary Black Belt and Professor of Diplomacy.\nHe remains in post at the age of 91 and continues to befuddle all his opponents.\nThe obsession with titles as I have pondered in  previous columns, is not reserved for only our leaders, it seems to be an African disease. Or so I thought until a friend of mine pointed out to me recently that it is not unlikely that it is something that we inherited from the British colonialists.\nIndeed who else has all these Sirs, Dukes, Duchess, Baroness, Viscounts, OBEs, CBEs etc etc? We have probably simply been trying to emulate them.\nThe official full title of the Head of State from which we got our independence is: Her Majesty, \"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\".\nTry matching that!

I am not an extremist, either violent or non-violent.\n\"Being labelled as some kind of extremist does have a stigmatising effect. I have not spoken at any universities since I was named in the [Downing Street] press release.\n\"My aim isn't just to clear my name, it is to bring transparency to the hidden processes by which individuals are tarnished with the label of an extremist, to ensure it is brought into the scrutiny of the courts.\"\nEarlier this year, a High Court judge ruled Mr Butt had an arguable case against the home secretary, and permission was granted to take the judicial review case to a full hearing.\nMr Butt's lawyers will be challenging part of the Prevent strategy that aims to stop people becoming or supporting terrorists.\nSpecifically they are challenging the Prevent duty, and how it has to be implemented in universities and further education institutions.\nSince September 2015, the Prevent duty, issued under the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, places universities and colleges in the UK under a legal obligation to engage with the Prevent strategy, and to have \"due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism\".\nThis means they are required to put in place specific polices to stop extremists radicalising students on campus, tackle gender segregation at events and support students at risk of radicalisation.\nSaimo Chahal QC, partner and human rights lawyer at Bindmans LLP, said Mr Butt's challenge was a test case.\n\"The Prevent duty guidance issued to higher education institutions is flawed because it conflicts with the right to free speech which is enshrined in the Education Act for higher education institutions,\" she said.\n\"The challenge, if successful, could have major implications for the controversial policy as it applies to universities and higher education,' she added.\nMr Butt's lawyers will also be challenging the definition of \"extremism\" under the Prevent strategy, which they say is ill defined.\nAdditionally, they have been given permission to challenge the way the government's Extremism Analysis Unit collected information about Mr Butt, arguing the process lacks transparency, and that the procedure for identifying people as extremists is flawed and in breach of the law.\nThe three-day hearing is likely to be fought vigorously and go on to the Supreme Court, owing to its potential implications on government policy.\nThe BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.\n\nSummary: The government's Extremism Analysis Unit has cleared Salman Butt of all charges related to non-violent extremism under the Prevent strategy.",

It may sound like something under your kitchen sink but it's standing in the way of an economic recovery.\nThe Bank of England is so worried about the shock of Brexit to economic growth that it is cutting interest rates and trying to pump money into the economy, by buying billions of pounds worth of gilts. Gilts are how the government borrows money and are seen as a very safe investment.\nBy buying them, the Bank of England hopes that it will encourage the sellers to spend the money they have raised in ways that boost growth; building new factories or spending in shops for example.\nBut as the Bank of England cuts interest rates, pension funds and other investors search for something that pays a reasonable level of interest  - and those are gilts. The lower interest rates go, the more they want to hold on to these safe and rewarding gilts.\nThis is the liquidity trap, the more the Bank of England tries to pump money or liquidity into the economy, the more investors want to put it somewhere safe, boring and unproductive.\nThe Bank is expected to roll over the \u00a352m it failed to buy this month to another auction later in the year.\nThe Bank's failure has had a similar effect on other bond markets with German bund yields falling sharply.\nMike Amey, managing director at Pimco said: \"The inability of the Bank of England to buy all of the bonds they wanted to yesterday does pose a challenge two days into their six month gilt buying programme.\n\"As a key part of the current policy easing, they will certainly hope that yesterday's events are not repeated. However the fact that they will only deal with the shortfall in three to six month's time suggests they are concerned about struggling to buy enough bonds in future asset purchases.\"\nThe price and yield on gilts have a huge effect on individuals and governments.\nFor governments, low yields make it easy for them to borrow cheaply.\nBut for individuals, especially those seeking a retirement income, and wanting to buy gilts now, low yields mean low returns on their savings.\nPeople retiring have traditionally bought an annuity - a financial product that promises a guaranteed income for life. Companies that sell annuities need to keep buying gilts to back that liability. The lower the yield on gilts, the less they can offer to the holder of the annuity.\nAs for final-salary pension schemes - which offer a set level of income - they also need to buy safe long-term investments to pay scheme members. But the lower gilt yields go, the less income they have to meet the costs of the scheme.\nMany economists believe that pension funds will continue to be very reluctant to sell gilts which they bought more cheaply when yields were higher, and which still give them a good return.\n\nSummary: The return on some UK government debt turned negative after the Bank of England missed its target in a new bond buying operation.",

There have been meetings between Taliban representatives and US officials over the past two years.\nThe Taliban have also sent their representatives to conferences on Afghanistan in Germany, Japan, and France but if talks proceed this would be the first time the group has met Afghan government representatives for direct talks.\nFrom now on, the Taliban will have a known address and authorised representatives who can openly talk, meet and travel. The Qatar office means the Taliban are no longer only a fighting group, but have a political arm too.\nWhy do the Taliban need a Qatar office?\nTaliban representatives have been in Qatar for more than a year and are said to number more than 20.\nFor years, the Afghan government and its Western backers were trying to contact the Taliban who didn't have a known address.\nMeetings aimed at resolving the Afghan conflict peacefully took in hotels or similar venues in various countries. But as a confidence-building measure, and as a way of providing security for Taliban leaders to participate in talks, finding them a permanent address became a priority.\nAllowing the Taliban to open an office in Turkey, Qatar, UAE or Saudi Arabia were possible measures. The Taliban's preferred venue was Qatar because they considered it to be neutral. The US was also happy with the Qatar option.\nWhat are the main obstacles?\nWithin hours of the Taliban office opening Mr Karzai raised his concerns about the peace process not being Afghan-led. He suspended plans for Afghan officials to meet the Taliban in Qatar, underlining how fraught the process will be.\nHis concerns were so great that US Secretary of State John Kerry had to promise that the Taliban flag and their sign reading The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan would be removed. The flag remains, albeit on a shorter flagpole.\nThere are other obstacles.\nThe first is that the Taliban insist on the complete withdrawal of foreign forces as a pre-condition to becoming part of a political settlement.\nNato's combat troops are due to leave the country by the end of 2014, but the US plans to station forces after that as part of a bilateral security agreement. Details are still to be agreed by Kabul and Washington.\nThe shape of the future Afghan government is another issue over which the parties disagree.\nAnother possible obstacle comes from civil groups and women's rights activists who fear a political settlement resulting in the Taliban's inclusion in the Afghan government would mean limitations on their freedoms.\nThe official opening of the Taliban's office was delayed because President Karzai was concerned it could be used for recruitment, fundraising and making contacts with other countries. He was looking for guarantees the office would only be used for peace talks.\nMr Karzai visited Qatar twice this year and on his latest trip Qatar reportedly accepted his demands for guarantees.  These included that:\nWhat are the main aims of the three parties?\nThe White House set two conditions: that the Taliban make a statement supporting a peace process and they also want to prohibit the use of Afghan soil to threaten other countries.\nTaliban leaders, most of whom have been subject to UN sanctions, see this as an opportunity to come in from the cold and present their case to the world.\nApart from the withdrawal of foreign forces, the Taliban also want the release of at least some prisoners from Guantanamo and Afghan jails, as well as the removal of the remaining leaders on the sanction list.\nThe Afghan government hopes it will be able to meet the Taliban directly without the involvement of a third party, such as Pakistan.\nUS and Afghan leaders want the Taliban to join the Afghan government as a result of the peace process, without losing the achievements of the past decade.\nThe peace talks will succeed, the Americans say, when the Taliban finally sever all ties with al-Qaeda, end violence and accept the Afghan constitution, including its protections for women and minorities.\nHave there been previous attempts at negotiation?\nPresident Karzai has long called on the Taliban to join the peace process. In late 2008 he even offered to provide security for the Taliban supreme leader, Mullah Omar, if he agreed to peace talks - this was not incentive enough.\nBut while the government's efforts were focused on re-integrating Taliban fighters, they did not have a reconciliation strategy.\nThe High Peace Council was established in 2010 and tasked with contacting the Taliban and convincing them to join the peace process.\nSporadic contacts were made with a number of Taliban leaders but it did not have the desired outcome of provoking large-scale desertions.\nIn turn, the Taliban did not trust the Afghan government and considered it a \"puppet\" of the US.\nThe  idea of engaging with the Taliban was initially controversial in the West but the idea of seriously engaging with the militants was explored at a 2011 peace conference.\nAre the Taliban now happy to talk to Afghan leaders?\nThe Taliban have for years refused to speak to the Afghan government or members of the High Peace Council. They insisted that they wanted to talk to the US - which they called \"the main party in the conflict\".\nBut the Taliban's statement as they opened their office says one of the main aims of the Doha office is \"to meet Afghans\".\nAlthough there was no recognition of President Karzai or his government and just a vague promise to talk to Afghans, \"if necessary\", that is still being read as an important shift.\nDoes Pakistan have a role?\nPakistan was one of the Taliban's main supporters from when it was launched in Kandahar in 1994 until the fall of the regime in 2001. Most of the Taliban's leaders reportedly then fled to Pakistan.\nTaliban representatives reportedly went to Qatar from Pakistan and the group is still considered to be heavily dependent on the support of certain elements in the country - although this has its limits.\nPakistan's co-operation will probably prove critical to convince or pressurise the Taliban to reach a political settlement.\nSo, talks are as much between Afghanistan and Pakistan as they are between the Afghan government and the Taliban.\nPresident Karzai has reached out to Islamabad and Pakistan has been involved in background talks over the office in Qatar.\nPakistani officials generally say Islamabad wants a \"friendly, peaceful and sovereign\" Afghanistan. But they are adamant that Pakistan's \"legitimate interests\" in Afghanistan must be recognised after the withdrawal of Nato troops.\n\nSummary: The Taliban have opened their first official overseas office in the Qatari capital, Doha, saying that one of their main aims was to \"meet Afghans\".",

Countless individuals and companies around the world rely on these rates to settle financial contracts,\" said the CFTC's director of enforcement Aitan Goelman.\nAnother US regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), fined Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America a further $950m (\u00a3600m).\nAll three regulators found the attempted manipulation of the foreign exchange market had been going on for several years, with the FCA saying the failings occurred between 1 January 2008 and 15 October 2013. The CFTC said its investigation found the traders' misconduct took place between 2009 and 2012.\nThey found certain foreign exchange traders at the banks had coordinated their trading with one another to attempt to manipulate benchmark foreign exchange rates.\nThe CFTC said traders had used private online chat rooms to communicate. They had disclosed confidential customer order information and trading positions, and altered their positions accordingly to \"benefit the interests of the collective group\".\nThe FCA said the \"tight knit groups\" formed by traders at the different banks had described themselves as \"the 3 musketeers\", \"the A-team\" and \"1 team, 1 dream\".\nIt said traders had attempted to manipulate the relevant currency rate in the market, for example to ensure that the rate at which the bank had agreed to sell a particular currency to its clients was higher than the average rate it had bought the currency. \"If successful, the bank would profit,\" the FCA added.\nBank R Trader: 4:00:35 pm: well done gents\nBank W Trader 1: 4:01:56 pm: hooray nice team work\nBank U Trader: 4:02:22 pm: nice one mate\nAnother example:\nBank V Trader: 4:00:51 pm: have that my son\nBank V Trader: 4:00:52 pm: hahga\nBank V Trader: 4:00:56 pm: v nice mate\nBank U Trader: 4:04:53 pm: that worked nice mate\nBank V Trader: 4:05:44 p.m.: big time mate.\nCFTC's examples of misconduct in private chat rooms\nHow the forex scandal happened\nForex scandal: How to rig the market\nThe banks all issued statements following the fines:\nChancellor George Osborne said the fines \"would be used for the wider public good\".\n\"Today we take tough action to clean up corruption by a few so that we have a financial system that works for everyone. It's part of a long-term plan that is fixing what went wrong in Britain's banks and our economy,\" he added.\nHowever, Professor Mark Taylor, a former foreign exchange trader and now dean at Warwick Business School, said the fines were \"relatively small beer for banks that regularly report billions of dollars in annual profit\".\n\"The interesting thing is that there are no individuals named as yet, and no individual  prosecutions. This is still a possibility and it will be interesting to see how that pans out. At the moment, it's really only the shareholders - which in the case of RBS means British taxpayers - who suffer from these fines,\" he added.\nFor the opposition, shadow chancellor Ed Balls described the affair as \"yet another shocking scandal involving the banks and underlines the need for fundamental reform and cultural change\".\n\"This report shows that reform of our banks has a long way to go. We need reforms to pay and bonuses, with more transparency, greater clawback and a tax on bank bonuses,\" he added.\nSeparately, the Bank of England - which had been accused of knowing about the foreign exchange scandal, but doing nothing about it - published a separate report by Lord Grabiner, clearing its officials.\n\"There was no evidence that any Bank of England official was involved in any unlawful or improper behaviour in the FX [foreign exchange] market,\" it said.\nIt said the suspension of the Bank's chief dealer in March, and his subsequent dismissal on 11 November was unrelated to the foreign exchange scandal.\n\"The individual's dismissal was as a result of information that came to light during the course of the Bank's initial internal review into allegations relating to the FX market and Bank staff. This information related to the Bank's internal policies, not to FX,\" a Bank spokesperson said.\n\nSummary: Six banks have been collectively fined \u00a32.6bn by UK and US regulators over their traders' attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates.",

It will then be sent to Mr Morsi for approval. After that, he must put it to a popular referendum.\nThe BBC's Jon Leyne, in Cairo, says issuing a constitution in these circumstances would be a deeply inflammatory move.\nOpposition figure and former Arab League chief Amr Moussa told Reuters news agency: \"This is nonsensical and one of the steps that shouldn't be taken, given the background of anger and resentment to the current constitutional assembly.\"\nEgypt's state-run news agency Mena said on Thursday it had obtained details of the draft constitution.\nMena said it included a clause on press freedom, and stated that only courts could suspend or close newspapers.\nThe assembly also aimed to set up a national security council led by the president and consisting of key officials such as the prime minister, defence minister and intelligence chief, Mena said.\nEgypt state TV struggles to shake off old habits\nEgyptians on presidential powers\nThursday's vote appeared to be aimed at dodging a ruling by the constitutional court on Sunday on whether the assembly should be dissolved.\nThe constitutional court's deputy chairman, Maher Sami, said in a televised speech that the ruling would go ahead.\n\"The court is determined to rise above its pain and continue its sacred mission until the end, wherever that takes us,\" he said.\nThe court has already dissolved the lower house of Egypt's parliament, which was led by the Muslim Brotherhood.\nThe declaration that sparked protests gave Mr Morsi powers to take any measures to protect the revolution, and stated that no court could overturn his decisions. It is valid until a new constitution is in place.\nCritics accuse Mr Morsi of trying to seize absolute power.\nSupporters say the extra powers were needed to protect the gains of the revolution against a judiciary with deep ties to the overthrown President Mubarak.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Morsi told Time magazine that he would surrender his new powers once a new constitution was in place.\n\"If we had a constitution, then all of what I have said or done last week will stop,\" he said.\n\"I hope, when we have a constitution, what I have issued will stop immediately.\"\nOn Monday, Mr Morsi told senior judges that the decrees would be restricted to \"sovereign matters\" designed to protect institutions.\nBut judges said they were not satisfied and wanted the declaration completely withdrawn.\nOn Wednesday, judges called a strike, saying appeals courts and the court of cassation would halt work until it was revoked.\nThere have been running protests since the decrees were issued, often spilling over into violent clashes between protesters and riot police.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood and the more radical al-Nour party have called for a counter-protest in Cairo on Saturday.\n\nSummary: The Islamist-dominated assembly writing a new Egyptian constitution has adopted the first part of the draft, including a measure keeping sharia, or Islamic law, as the main source of legislation.",

The timetable was arranged to fit in with fashion magazine deadlines and production schedules, but the arrival of the internet has disrupted that.\nNow customers want to buy things instantly.\nThe annual four shows - two for women and two for men - are to be combined into just two.\nLast year the company said it was merging its three fashions lines - Burberry Prorsum, London and Brit - and they would all be bought under one label, Burberry.\nBurberry clearly are hoping to boost sales, and profits, from making its clothes available straight away. Cutting back on two shows will also save substantial amounts of money.\nChief Executive Christopher Bailey said making the clothes available straight away was what the customers were asking for.\n\"In the past the shows were for mainly for the industry, buyers and fashion journalists.

If they have too much, and it doesn't sell, it will eat into their profits. But if there is not enough, then there will be disappointed customers who don't get what they have been promised.\"\nBut Imran Amed, the founder and chief executive of the blog the Business of Fashion, was confident that Burberry can make it work: \"It's a game changer and it's a very bold move that some others will follow.\"\nHe said there had been a massive shift in the fashion industry thanks to social media.\nThe fashion houses faced considerable uncertainly in the next 18 to 24 months, Mr Amed added, and not everyone would be able to afford to do what Burberry is going to do.\nBurberry, which was established in 1856, started out making gabardine coats and outwear.

The slowdown in the Chinese economy has had an impact but last November the company reported a 9% increase in pre-tax profits, while saying it faced a \"challenging environment\".\nIt was the first company to put its fashion shows live on the internet, so that anyone from Beijing to Brighton could see the collection.\nBurberry has also run digital campaigns on Snapchat and Instagram. And since 2009 it has been possible to pre-order the clothes from the shows online - the only major British label to do so.\n\nSummary: Burberry is set to introduce a new line of gabardine coats at its upcoming Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter fashion shows.",

In the opening spell, Kilmarnock were deep, narrow and rigidly organised, while there were outbreaks of desperation in defence.\nStoutness was a defining characteristic and the tone was set by the captain Mark Connolly.\nThe defender was playing his first game since suffering an injury in August but he was alert, strong and grimly determined. In the space of only a matter of seconds, he blocked shots by Stuart Armstrong and James Forrest.\nThat kind of defiance was Kilmarnock's main purpose, since it was the most likely way that they could dispirit Celtic.\nThe home side were seldom perturbed, though, since they routinely spent long spells in their opponents' half and must have constantly been reassured that the sheer weight of pressure would eventually tell.\nThe visitors' full-backs Mark O'Hara and Kevin McHattie could not enjoy a moment's respite but they never wavered.\nO'Hara saw off Armstrong and then was similarly capable with his replacement, Gary Mackay-Steven. McHattie had the more difficult task, since Forrest was in the kind of mood to bewilder his marker with a drop of the shoulder or a shuffle of his quick feet.\nNonetheless, Celtic did enough to threaten but found the finishing touch was out of reach.\nIt was typical of Leigh Griffiths' afternoon that an errant touch took the Celtic striker away from goal after darting clear of the Kilmarnock defenders. Later in the first half, he controlled a through ball brilliantly but, from between the two centre backs and at close range, he tamely stabbed the ball straight at Jamie MacDonald.\nWhile Kilmarnock snapped into tackles and were so set on an aggressive tone that flash points inevitably arose, Celtic remained adrift from their decisive nature.\nWith so many opposition players behind the ball, the league leaders had to probe patiently but alertness was often missing and Griffiths finished weakly again when the ball broke to him just inside the penalty area.\nKilmarnock, who earned a 2-2 draw at home to Celtic in August, tried to stretch play through Josh Magennis and Kallum Higginbotham, who were persistent in their endeavour, but even that waned after the break as the hosts dominated possession.\nMacDonald saved smartly from a Griffiths free-kick at the beginning of the first-half and then tipped a thunderous Dedryck Boyata header onto the face of the bar in the closing moments.\nIn between, Celtic felt they might have had penalties when Brown and Mackay-Steven went down but referee Bobby Madden was unmoved.\nIn truth, the hosts' play lacked the tempo or the guile to create clear chances and the desperation to score almost cost them at the end.\nCraig Gordon had to dive to his left to save from Greg Kiltie and then Tope Obadeyi.\nAs if to subdue Celtic further, Brown also seemed to injure himself in a challenge and finished the game being unable to run.\nMatch ends, Celtic 0, Kilmarnock 0.\nSecond Half ends, Celtic 0, Kilmarnock 0.\nCorner,  Celtic.

One was tied to a tree.\nPhang Nga is several hundred kilometres away from the site in Songkhla province where 26 bodies were found last week.\nThree Thais and a Burmese national have been arrested in Thailand on suspicion of human trafficking.\nThe mass grave containing 26 bodies was discovered in an abandoned jungle camp close to the Malaysian border - an area regularly used by people-smugglers.\nSeparately, a second camp with at least another five graves has been found in Songkhla province, officials said on Tuesday.\nThe area is on a route regularly used by Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma).\nOfficials believe would-be migrants are held in the camps by traffickers who demand ransoms from their families.\nThailand has been strongly criticised for failing to act against trafficking networks, which typically hold thousands of people from Myanmar and Bangladesh every year for ransom, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports from Phang Nga.\nPolice said the Thais arrested on Monday included one local council member from Songkhla province and two village officials.\nRights groups have long alleged that officials and local police are aware of, or complicit in, the trade.\nI had been in these mangrove swamps before, looking for the camps where distraught Rohingyas and Bangladeshis told us they had been held in dreadful conditions. Now we were back to find out who had not survived.\nOn another island, scattered human bones lay under the mangrove roots on the beach. There were clear signs large numbers of people had lived here - rusting food cans, mouldering shoes and threadbare tarpaulins.\nThe Thai authorities have known about these camps for years.\nLocal communities are paid off to keep quiet, or their young men employed as guards. Police and other officials get their cut of a business where traffickers pay $20,000 (\u00c2\u00a313,160) or more for a boatload of migrants, then try to recoup the cost by demanding big ransoms from their families.\nThose who cannot pay are kept, and often terribly abused or killed. Last year a senior police officer told me about a huge transit camp right on the Malaysian border.\nBut they could not move against it - the area was controlled by the army, he said.\nThailand has a military government. If they really want to show serious purpose in shutting down the trade, they will have to take action against people in their own ranks.\nThe Burmese national was named as Soe Naing, known as Anwar. He was a \"central figure who ran camps and sought ransoms\", deputy police commander Anuchon Chamart told AFP news agency.\nAnother four suspects - also local officials - are being sought by police.\nMany of the victims found in the camp are thought to have died from disease or starvation. A survivor told Thai media there were other mass graves in the area.\nEvery year thousands of people are trafficked through Thailand and into Malaysia.\nRohingya Muslims in particular have used the route to flee persecution and sectarian violence in neighbouring Myanmar.\nIn 2012, more than 200 people were killed and thousands left homeless after violence broke out between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar. Anti-Muslim violence has flared several times since then.\nIn December, the UN passed a resolution urging Myanmar to give access to citizenship for the Rohingya, many of whom are classed as stateless.\n\nSummary: Thai officials say they have found two skeletons possibly linked to people smuggling, days after the discovery of 26 bodies in a mass grave.",

Hopefully I'll be back next week refreshed and back to 100%\".\nChief executive Ben Congleton replied to the message, saying: \"I can't believe this is not standard practice at all organisations,\" adding: \"You are an example to us all, and help cut through the stigma so we can all bring our whole selves to work.\"\nIn the UK, there is no legal difference between taking a mental health sick day and a day off for a physical problem like a back problem.\nLast year, Britons took 137 million sick days. Of these, 15.8 million days were for a stated mental health issue - whether that is stress, depression, anxiety or a more serious condition such as manic depression and schizophrenia - according to Office for National Statistics Labour Force Survey statistics.\nBy contrast, 34 million days were \"lost\" to minor illnesses, like coughs and colds.\nBut Madeleine McGivern, head of workplace wellbeing at charity Mind, says \"people are still wary\" of admitting their sick day is actually due to mental health.\n\"There is definitely a fear it will affect your career, or that people will judge you and make assumptions that aren't fair or true,\" she says.\n\"If you're not in a supportive environment, if you do disclose a mental health problem it can be really harmful to you.\"\nDespite the stigma, she says employers are legally required to protect the health and safety of those at work - and this includes mental health problem if it affects a person's day-to-day life.\n\"If you are unwell for any reason, you should be able to work in a place where you feel you can say 'I'm unwell today because I've got an inflamed back' or 'I've got really high feelings of anxiety at the moment' - they're actually the same thing,\" she says.\nLisa, a 42-year-old manager, contacted the BBC to say she felt pressured to \"put on a brave face\" and go to work while dealing with depression.\n\"I've been working in the public sector for over 20 years and have twice had short periods off work through mental health issues,\" she says.\nShe says she feared being stigmatised as \"flaky\" if she took time off.\n\"The need to 'put on a brave face' was overwhelming and in the end too much for me,\" she says.\n\"I was prescribed anti-depressants and stayed off work for a few weeks. Even when I returned I wasn't supported and felt further ostracised.\"\nLisa says her career had \"until now been the defining passion in my life\", adding: \"As a previously high-performing individual the treatment I received felt like a bereavement.\"\nSix months ago, she took time off after dealing with ageing parents and her moving house.\n\"I took just a few days off work to 'sort myself out', seeing the GP, finding a counsellor and starting an exercise and diet regime.\"\nNow, she says \"I am still battling on\" but that there are still days when she feels her workplace does not care about her as an individual.\n\"It makes me wonder how other people are coping and what is going on under the surface of a lot of other 'brave faces',\" she says.\nLarge companies are keen to say they are supporting staff and tackling stigma around mental health.\nOver the past six years, almost 500 companies - including Tesco, Unilever and M&S - have made a pledge known as \"Time to Change\", where they commit to tackling problems like anxiety and depression in the workplace.\nIt involves training managers to spot the signs of mental illness among their workers and raise awareness.\n\"When you look at the reality of the situation, mental health isn't being addressed properly,\" says Sam Gurney, head of equality and strategy at the Trades Union Congress (TUC).\nResearch by the TUC shows just one in four people who have suffered from a mental illness or phobia for one year are in work.\n\"People can be terrified of saying they have some kind of issue,\" Sam says.\n\"If you're on a zero-hours contract, you're far less likely to go to your boss and say 'I've got these issues' because they're going to see that person as a problem.\"\nMany workplace unions encourage employers to have a sickness procedure that covers issues such as anxiety - and to tackle the root cause of mental issues, for example by training employees to also act as mentors.\nIn light of more professional footballers seeking help for mental health problems, including Everton's Aaron Lennon, the Professional Footballers' Association runs a 24-hour helpline and says it is telling players it is \"OK to talk\".\nPolice, fire, ambulance and search-and-rescue teams in England and Wales are unusual in that workers receive government-funded mental health support.\nThrough a \u00c2\u00a31.5m grant, Mind provides emergency staff and volunteers with access to help under a project known as Blue Light.\nMs McGivern says the charity also offers legal advice to anyone feeling forced out at work, adding: \"There's something to be said about the way we look for work.\n\"The power's with the employee to choose where to work and ask - are they going to work with me or break me into a million pieces?\" she says.\n\nSummary: Madalyn Parker, a US web developer, sparked a debate about workplace attitudes to mind problems after tweeting an email from her boss.",

In Argentina alone, episodes are viewed by more than 12 million people.\nAnd the show is far from a one-off, with a growing number of Turkish TV dramas among the most watched programmes across the continent.\nIn Chile for example, a Turkish series called 1,001 Nights was the most viewed programme in 2014.\nBut why are television programmes from Turkey so popular thousands of miles away in South America?\nMarcela Mera, a 42-year-old Chilean who lives in the capital Santiago, is a dedicated viewer of Turkish dramas.\nShe says that they are easier for her to connect to than US television series and that she likes the way Turkish shows focus more on old fashioned romance instead of what she sees as Hollywood's over-sexualisation.\n\"Although Turkey is quite far away, I found our cultures to be quite similar,\" says Marcela.\n\"And the Turkish productions are very high quality and don't have the Hollywood cliches and stereotypes.\n\"When I started to watch these dramas, I realised how tired I was with all the violence and sex of American TV.\"\nIn the Peruvian capital of Lima, Ivette Sanchez, a 23-year-old university student, is another big fan of Turkish TV shows.\nShe says: \"I regularly get together with my friends and host Turkish TV nights, watching these dramas and chatting. The plots are clever and productions are excellent.\n\"Also, the actors are very handsome. We all have different favourites.\"\nThe popularity of Turkish TV shows in South America comes as Turkey's television industry is continuing to enjoy a growing export boom.\nLast year Turkey earned $250m (\u00a3187m) from overseas sales of TV shows, according to the Turkish Exporters Assembly (TEA) trade organisation. This compares with only $10,000 (\u00a37,475) back in 2004.\nTurkish TV dramas are now watched by more than 400 million people in more than 140 countries.\nAnd while Turkey's current TV export earnings are dwarfed by the likes of the UK, which enjoyed overseas TV sales of $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) in the 2014-2015 financial year, the country hopes to catch up.\nBader Arslan, the secretary-general of the TEA, expects Turkish TV exports to top $1bn (\u00a3748m) by 2023.\nWith most current overseas earnings coming from South America, Burhan Gun, president of the Turkish TV and Cinema Producers Guild, says there are a number of key reasons why that continent has so warmly embraced his country's television dramas.\nFirstly, he says that Turkish people can look very similar to many South Americans.\nMr Gun, whose organisation represents Turkey's more than 80 privately-owned TV production companies, adds: \"As Turkey is a very multicultural country, there are actors that represent a lot of different ethnic backgrounds.\"\nHe also says that Turkish dramas explore societal changes that resonate in South America and other parts of the world.\n\"For instance, a lot of the Turkish TV shows explore the topic of migration from rural villages to cities and the challenges of urbanisation,\" says Mr Gun.\n\"This is an important topic in a lot of other developing countries, but it is underexplored by Western productions.\"\nOmar Al-Ghazzi, a lecturer in journalism at the UK's University of Sheffield, who has written a number of academic papers about Turkish popular culture, adds that Turkish TV dramas \"offer a seductive modernity\".\nHe explains: \"They showcase very saleable ideas about a comfortable middle class life that is accessible and culturally relevant for many people.\"\nWhile the continuing overseas success of Turkish TV shows is undoubtedly welcomed by the country's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, because it boosts the country's international image and reputation, the industry stresses that it is completely independent and free of any government support.\nTurkey's TV production companies are also occasionally criticised by the president (who recently survived an attempted army coup), such as back in 2012 when he complained about a show called The Magnificent Century.\nPresident Erdogan was unhappy that the series portrayed a 16th century Ottoman sultan as both a drinker and womaniser.\nBack in South America, Alper Akosman, a 28-year-old Turkish businessman who lives in Chile, says that thanks to the popularity of Turkish TV shows, many Chileans are now interested in his home country.\nHe adds that he recently went to a charity fundraising event where the theme was Turkish TV dramas.\n\"There were Turkish flags, food and music everywhere,\" he says. \"People kept asking me if there was any way I could reach out to the actors and send them a message.\n\"These TV series have achieved something that most diplomacy tactics wouldn't have. It's unbelievable.\"\nMeanwhile, Mr Arslan says that when he joined President Erdogan's visit to Chile, Peru, and Ecuador back in February, Turkish TV shows were great conversation starters.\n\"In Peru a person told me how similar our two countries' family values are, despite the different religions and cultures.\"\n\nSummary: The popularity of American TV dramas in South America is attributed to their relatable themes and high-quality production, as viewers from Chile to Peru tune in for their favorite shows.",

a claim the Home Office has disputed.\nThe Scottish government said the situation was \"unacceptable\".\nAccording to the charity, the new figures to \"some extent\" reflected an overall increase in the number of people claiming protection in Scotland, including asylum seekers from Syria.\nBut it claimed changes made in 2014 to the support and advice offered by the Home Office had also increased destitution among migrants.\nA BRC spokeswoman said: \"There's been a change to a telephone model of providing [asylum support] advice, which has made it more difficult for those with language barriers to access support.\"\nShe added that she believed the Home Office was requiring \"more and more\" information from asylum applicants, while also withdrawing advocacy from the service specification.\nAsked how destitution had been defined, the BRC said it considered clients to be destitute if they did not eat sufficiently, had no fixed home, could not afford essential items and/or were experiencing worsening health.\nIn April 2014,  government-funded advice for asylum seekers living in Scotland began being delivered by Migrant Help, a charity based in the south east of England.\nPreviously, this contract was held by the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC), based in Glasgow.\nThe Home Office disputed any suggestions that Migrant Help did not offer the same level of face-to-face support as SRC, adding that Migrant Help had a \"well-established presence\" in Scotland.\nThe figures prompted the Scottish government to accuse the UK government of delivering a \"consistent reduction\" in the support it offered to asylum seekers.\nLast year, the SRC called for an inquiry  into the treatment of asylum seekers in Glasgow.\nNoreen, a single mum in Glasgow, was destitute and an asylum seeker during her pregnancy\nAfter fleeing persecution in her homeland of Pakistan, Noreen's claim for asylum in the UK was initially refused.\nAlone and with no right to work or receive government support, she told BBC Scotland enduring her pregnancy was \"a living nightmare\".\n\"I was so down that when I was seven months pregnant I told the doctor I didn't want the baby - but it was already too late.\"\n\"I was crying saying, 'I am so hungry, I don't even have any food',\" she said.\nNoreen said she did not receive government support until she was nine months pregnant.\nUntil then, she was forced to rely on charities and friends to survive.\nBut Noreen revealed that before her pregnancy, the asylum process had already driven her into a severe depression.\n\"I was admitted to hospital twice, after trying to cut my veins,\" she told BBC Scotland.\n\"I didn't want to live - there was no hope for me,\" she added.\nToday, Noreen has been granted refugee status and lives with her two children in Glasgow.\nNames have been changed.\nWhat can the Scottish government do?\nWhile immigration and asylum policy is reserved to the UK government, the Scottish government can provide support to asylum seekers under devolved functions, such as education, social care and health.\nThe Scottish Parliament's Equalities and Human Rights Committee (EHRC) has launched an inquiry into destitution amongst asylum seekers - which will publish its findings and recommendations in April.\nEqualities Secretary Angela Constance said she hoped the inquiry would \"shine a light\" on the issue of destitution and asylum in Scotland.\nThe Scottish Refugee Council said it hoped the EHRC inquiry would lead to \"concrete actions to support people bearing the brunt of the UK government's hostile environment policy for immigrants\".\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and those seeking refuge have access to a range of advice and support in the UK.\n\"Migrant Help offers asylum seekers access to online literature and both telephone and face-to-face advice.\n\"Outreach sessions are held around the UK, including in Scotland where [Migrant Help] have a well-established presence.\n\"It is only right that the service refers asylum seekers looking for legal advice to qualified solicitors who are cleared to handle immigration matters.\n\"Those who do not need our help should leave the country rather than being supported by UK taxpayers.\"\nMigrant Help said: \"In Scotland, Migrant Help offers face-to-face advice to asylum seekers accommodated in the initial accommodation, but also to those in dispersal accommodation who are deemed vulnerable.\n\"All asylum seekers across the UK can access our free telephone helpline which offers independent advice tailored to the region where the caller is based.\"\n\nSummary: The British Red Cross reports a decrease in destitute migrants in Scotland, despite government claims.",

America now has a president who's a constituency of one.\n\"For me Trump represents the worst of America, while Tennessee Williams was a creative genius Americans should be proud of. So it's a delight to be in the play.\"\nWilliams wrote The Glass Menagerie in 1944. A Streetcar Named Desire and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof later brought him money and worldwide fame, but his early \"memory play\" had been an extraordinary achievement for a young writer.\n\"Tennessee was a poet, a rebel and a gay man,\" says Jones. \"He was a unique talent and chose his own path.\n\"He's influenced other writers, but I don't think anyone has ever quite been like him.\"\nEsper's role of Tom is usually seen as a self-portrait by the playwright, whose real first name was Thomas.\n\"The extraordinary thing about the way the lines and the structure work is they don't feel almost three-quarters of a century old,\" he says.\n\"His humour and the moments of lyricism feel contemporary. The four characters on stage relate in a way which still means something today.\"\nJones too is full of admiration for Williams the writer.\n\"For instance, he sets up superbly the arrival of the 'Gentleman Caller' in the second part of the play, who my character hopes will marry her daughter.\n\"And when he arrives there's so much humour and emotion that the audience is laughing one moment and then suddenly dead silent.\n\"At the risk of sounding like a flatterer, British audiences seem good at listening and picking up the nuances of what's being said.\"\nEsper, though, says there has been a downside to his extended stay east of the Atlantic.\n\"Part of me feels I really want to be back in my community and being part of the protest against Trump.\n\"You can't say we need to sit back and just bide our time while he's in office.\"\n\"Most of the people I know have taken an incredibly activist stance and that's exactly the right thing,\" Esper continues.\n\"Certainly I had no love for Ronald Reagan, but as president I think he had respect for the tenets of democracy.\n\"Donald Trump is already violating the constitution and destroying the country and humiliating us internationally.\"\nJones has long been open about being a lesbian. So is she anxious about President Trump's views on homosexuality?\nIn America some gay people have expressed fears about policies which might be put forward.\n\"Who knows what may emerge?\" says the 60-year-old. \"But for now, Donald Trump seems to have a ton of gay friends he's okay with - especially if they're white and gay.\n\"My worry is what would happen if he were indicted or impeached or gotten rid of. Then we'd have [vice president] Mike Pence in charge, and he tried to pass bills [as governor] in the state of Indiana which were just outrageous.\n\"If Pence were in the White House I would worry about policies relating to gay people.\"\n\"It's wonderful we're appearing in a work by one of America's greatest gay writers,\" Jones continues. \"But like Michael, part of me feels a traitor for being away and enjoying myself.\n\"At the end of the run, I look forward to going back and getting to work.\"\nThe Glass Menagerie is at the Duke of York's Theatre in London until 29 April.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Thirty seven others have died, and three have left the village for good.\nEven World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, which indicate that India has a road accident death every four minutes, pale in the case of Peddakunta.\n\"There are no men left there\", says 65-year-old Mohammed Dastagir, who runs a paan-cigarette shop near the road leading to the village.\n\"The village headquarters are on the other side of the highway. Everyone has to cross it to get any work with the government done - and many do not return. The most shocking death was a few months ago when a member of a nearby village went to the government office with a petition over the high number of deaths and died while returning.\"\nInside the village, 44-year-old Korra Sakini lost her son to the highway three years ago. Her husband died a few months later, at the same spot, where the path from the village meets the busy bypass.\n\"They give us half a kilo of rice to eat. I have no money, no family, no work, and nothing to live for. The gods have cursed us. No male in our village will live for long.

This never materialised, and as a result villagers are forced to walk across the four lanes of the highway bypass if they are to collect their monthly pensions or take up employment in nearby villages.\nThariya Korra, is the only man left alive, but lost his wife to the highway.\nHe has had to look after his five-year-old son alone ever since. \"First came the highway. It brought no prosperity, only death. The factory nearby came later. We were promised water, a health centre and jobs. Nothing happened,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They could not get us to sell our land to a factory. They will never build a bypass. Once we are all dead, they can just take the land.\"\nThe situation has meant that the village is one of the poorest in the district.\nAlcoholism and illiteracy further compound their woes.\nSeven-year-old Anchan is one of only five village children who go to a nearby school.\n\"We are afraid when they are late. We have had too much to mourn and nothing to celebrate,\" his mother says.\nAs a result, many of the women are forced into prostitution for money, and sometimes even for food.\nKorra Panni tells her story without a trace of pain. \"What can we do?

She is just too influential.\nSecondly, Ms Suu Kyi has long defended sanctions as a way to keep pressure on the powerful Burmese military.\nThirdly, despite Ms Suu Kyi's rise to power, the Burmese army has shown little sign of stepping back from political life or allowing the country's undemocratic constitution to be changed.\nSo why then has Ms Suu Kyi removed the last remaining stick with which to prod the military?\n\"It is the right thing to do in order to ensure that the people of Burma see rewards from a new way of doing business and a new government,\" President Obama said, as he announced the decision.\nBut there are a few problems with that.\nFirst, most of the US sanctions were targeted - not aimed at the Burmese people but deliberately focused on key individuals and companies who supported the old military regime.\nOne hundred and eleven individuals and companies are on the soon-to-be-scrapped blacklist.\nThey are some of Myanmar's dodgiest characters.\nAmong them, men who gave the orders to fire on demonstrators and imprison activists and opposition leaders, including Ms Suu Kyi.\nThere are businesses that helped procure weapons and others that were dubiously awarded juicy contracts to build, among many things, Myanmar's empty capital, Naypyitaw.\nIn the upmarket bars of Yangon, also known as Rangoon, the generals and their families will be toasting President Obama.\nTheir crony businesses can now freely compete for US investment with cleaner, more ethical, companies.\nFor their part, American companies coming to Myanmar now have greater choice of partners and much fewer restrictions.\nIt will be easier for them to make money.\nSo how is Ms Suu Kyi explaining it?\nIn Washington, she said: \"We think that the time has now come to remove all the sanctions that hurt us economically, because our country is in a position to open up to those who are interested in taking part in our economic enterprises.\"\nSo no real justification of the change to her position - perhaps she just feels it is time to move on.\nMs Suu Kyi's critics will see the sanctions issue as further evidence she now cares about power, not principle.\nThe greater democracy and constitutional change that she once campaigned for are now accepted as distant goals.\nPerhaps she thinks the time has come to reward the military for the progress that has been made, to consolidate the growing confluence between the former democracy campaigner and the generals.\nThere is another plausible explanation suggested to me by a Washington insider - one that explains Ms Suu Kyi's seemingly sudden change of heart.\nI was told that, despite appearances, Ms Suu Kyi was not in full agreement with the decision, but had been left with little choice.\nAmerican sanctions on Myanmar are authorised under what is known as the National Emergencies Act.\nIn place since 1997, it rather bizarrely categorises the country as an \"extraordinary threat\" to US national security, giving the president emergency executive powers.\nFor obvious reasons, Ms Suu Kyi wanted the misleading act to be terminated but also thought some of the targeted sanctions, particularly on military companies, should remain.\nBut, according to my source, US officials told her it was all or nothing, and the historic decision was made to lift all sanctions.\nAttempts to clarify whether Ms Suu Kyi had indeed had reservations went unanswered, both from the US and the Burmese sides.\n\nSummary: President Barack Obama has announced the lifting of all economic sanctions on Myanmar without the influence or approval of Aung San Suu Kyi.",

The victims are usually promised, in advance, a happy, comfortable and free life in Britain, but arrive to discover misery, squalor and varying degrees of imprisonment.\nBecause there are so many different models of slavery, it is a problem that can only be tackled through a wide range of agencies working together.  The Home Office has to create laws that can be used; prosecutors have to use them.  The police have to understand the often subtle coercion implicit in trafficking.  They must co-ordinate linked investigations across Britain.\nThe new National Crime Agency must get to grips with the organised gangs, charities such as the Salvation Army need to focus on helping - and crucially identifying - the victims.\nBut perhaps the biggest problem of all is that no-one really knows how big this problem is. How many 'modern day slaves' there are hidden in flats in our inner cities, unable physically or mentally to escape.\nVictims brought to the UK are forced to do anything from work as house slaves to labour in cannabis farms.\nEastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work.\nThere is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud - gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to victims.\nThose targeted are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes by family members.  An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK.\nKlara Skrivankova, from the Anti-Slavery International group, wants greater protection for victims - including the right to stay in the UK.\n\"Tougher penalties and longer sentences alone do not suffice,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"Unless the protection of victims is put on a statutory footing, we're unlikely to see more prosecutions.\"\nVictims minister Damian Green said the trafficking of vulnerable men and women was something \"no civilised country should tolerate\".\n\"On Anti-Slavery Day I am proud that this government is standing strong against those who profit from human misery and last year gave \u00c2\u00a33m to support those who have suffered at their hands.\"\nChief constable Shaun Sawyer of the Association of Chief Police Officers said \"the national approach is very much about the protection of the victim\", but he added: \"I agree that the signposting and signalling could be clearer\".\n\"A lot of people are prosecuted for GBH, rape, violence against the individual - it's far easier to bring the perpetrator to justice this way. This Bill will make it easier to prosecute for trafficking.\"\nDavid Hanson MP, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said that the government needed to focus on prosecutions, pointing to the last government report which identified 946 potential victims of human trafficking, but \"only eight convictions\".\n\"The government also needs to wake up to the fact that 60% of trafficked children simply go missing again in the UK after they've come to the attention of the authorities,\" he added. \"It should be a source of shame.\"\nIn her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill.\n\nSummary: The UK government has announced a significant decrease in human trafficking cases, with new legislation to further reduce the numbers.",

But a superb diving slip catch by Root accounted for Hazlewood and gave Ben Stokes his first wicket since the first innings of the Cardiff Test.\nNathan Lyon helped add 20 for the final wicket before Starc chipped Moeen Ali to extra cover to bring roars of relief from England's supporters.\nFrom then on, the volume was rarely below maximum as the crowd cheered England to a glorious Ashes win.\nThe fourth Test starts next Thursday at Trent Bridge - and England will be without James Anderson.\nWith a 2-1 lead, victory in Nottingham would see England regain the Ashes irrespective of the outcome of the fifth Test at the Oval on 20 August.\nA victory for Australia next week would mean that, with the series level at 2-2, the tourists could retain the Ashes just by drawing the final Test. Ashes tradition states that in the event of a drawn series, the holders retain the urn.\nEngland captain Alastair Cook: \"The Edgbaston atmosphere is unique and it was as loud as I can ever remember it. The way Jimmy [Anderson] bowled in that first innings was fantastic, but I don't think it was a 140-all out pitch.\n\"It's been an amazing comeback from Steven Finn. Standing there at slip, you thought he was going to get a nick every ball. The character he has shown to come back after a lot of hard work is incredible.\"\nAustralia captain Michael Clarke: \"It's very hard to explain. Credit has to go to England, they bowled well on day one and we didn't bat anywhere near we'd have liked. I still would have batted first, you can see the wicket has deteriorated.\n\"It swung and seamed throughout the whole game. We probably had the best batting conditions, we just didn't execute with bat and ball.\"\nEngland bowler Steven Finn: \"This week has been fantastic and I'm thoroughly enjoying Test cricket again. There were a few nerves in the first few balls and you question yourself but after that it was focusing on getting people out.\n\"It is as nice a feeling as I have ever had taking a wicket [dismissing Steve Smith in the first innings]. It is the most I have ever celebrated a wicket. I did doubt at times if I'd play again but knew I could be good enough again. To be stood here now, there is no better feeling.\"\n\nSummary: Australia secured a dominant eight-wicket win against England, leveling the Ashes series at 2-2 with a spirited performance at Edgbaston.",

The subject, which was described by critics as teaching little more than how to use Microsoft Office, is being replaced by the more rigorous computer science GCSE.\nBut figures from Ofqual showing entries for the exam rising to 67,800 this year from 61,220 in 2016 have set alarm bells ringing. With 58,600 still taking the ICT exam, the overall number getting a GCSE computing qualification has fallen slightly.\nThe British Computing Society says that when ICT disappears, the computer science exam will fail to fill the gap.\n\"If we don't act now,\" says Bill Mitchell from the BCS, \"by 2020 we are likely to see the number of students studying computing at GCSE halve, when it should be doubling. If that happens, it will be a disaster for our children, and the future of the nation.\"\nThe other big concern is that too few girls are taking up the computer science exam - in 2016 they made up just 20% of entrants, while the figure for ICT has been around 40%.\nProf Rose Luckin says the subject has an image problem.\n\"Computer science is seen as more 'techie' and it is still dominated by men,\" explains the expert from University College London's Knowledge Lab, who has been researching and writing about the teaching of technology for 20 years.\n\"Many girls believe computer science and coding is 'for boys' and they do not see desirable career options that appeal to them.\"\nWhat seems clear is that the computer science exam is far more challenging, both for students and teachers. That was of course the aim, but those who warned that ending ICT risked throwing the baby out with the bathwater may now feel vindicated.\nDrew Buddie, who is head of computing at a school near London, has always argued that ICT was unfairly maligned and was far more creative than its critics assumed.\nNow, he says, \"it is clear that many 14-to-17-year-old students, particularly girls, are not attracted to such a specific and narrow course.\"\n\"The current GCSE in computer science has replaced the opportunities for creativity that existed in ICT with set programming tasks that have very few solutions,\" he adds.\nThe British Computing Society, which lobbied for the new GCSE, insists that it always argued for a new IT qualification to complement computer science, but that was rejected by ministers.\nThe organisation says it is unrealistic to expect teachers of ICT to turn into teachers of computer science without significant training and support - and despite initiatives from organisations like Computing At School there has just not been enough funding to usher in this revolution.\nI put some of these criticisms to the Department for Education. A spokesman stressed that the new exam had been designed with industry experts to develop the computational skills needed for today's economy.\nHe pointed out that the numbers taking it had more than doubled since 2015 and said \"we expect that number to continue to rise while ICT GCSE is phased out. We are continuing to work to encourage even greater uptake of computer science, especially among girls.\"\nBut Prof Luckin says the situation is urgent.\n\"We need to focus on understanding exactly why students are not attracted to computer science so that we can ensure an appropriately skilled workforce for the future, not least amongst the teaching profession,\" she says.\nAnd she adds that the advent of artificial intelligence makes this mission even more vital.\nFive years ago, it seemed just about everyone, from teachers to business leaders to politicians, was in agreement about the need for radical changes in the way children were taught about computers.\nBut today it is hard to find many who are happy with the speed and direction of the revolution in computing education.\n\nSummary: The new computer science GCSE in England has seen a surge in popularity, with a significant increase in students taking the exam and showing interest in the field.",

In theory five sets of local elections need to be organised before the presidential poll.\nLocal civil society groups accuse the electoral commission of intentionally dragging its feet to organise local polls and to be \"illegally linking the organisation of the election to a national dialogue\".\nMr Kabila called for a countrywide dialogue last month, saying on national television that it was only way to avoid a crisis and to revive the electoral process.\nCritics see it as a strategy to try to co-opt political opponents with positions or money.\nKabila also hinted at the possibility of an indirect or an electronic vote in the presidential election, to save money, which some say would make rigging the poll easier.\nHe has not directly commented on suspicions that he might be trying to cling to power.\nBut the spokesman of the ruling party, Andr\u00c3\u00a9-Alain Atundu, said that it would take \"two to four more years to organise credible elections\".\nSources close to Kabila say that, as the man who secured an important peace deal in the early 2000s following years of civil conflict that killed millions, he genuinely feels the country could implode if he were to leave at the end of next year, especially without having organised a successful dialogue.\nThere are still dozens of armed groups with ties to politicians in the east of the country and the army's own loyalties are divided.\n\"Opposition leaders have said president Kabila should be judged by the International Criminal Court,\" said one source close to him. \"That is hardly the language of appeasement.\"\nIt is true the country is still fragile. But it is difficult to see how the president staying on would guarantee peace.\nBorn in a rebel camp in eastern DR Congo - where he enjoys most of his support\nSpent his childhood in Tanzania\nHis father, Laurent Kabila, overthrew long-time ruler Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997\nHe first became president - the world's youngest head of state - after his father's assassination in 2001\nOversaw the signing of a peace accord in 2002 to end a five-year conflict involving several other nations\nBecame DR Congo's first freely elected leader in 2006, winning a run-off poll with 58% of the vote\nSecured another term in controversial elections in 2011\nHas enjoyed the clear support of western governments, regional allies such as South Africa and Angola and mining groups that have signed multi-million dollar deals under his rule\nRevered in the Swahili-speaking east, where he is widely credited with helping to end the 1998-2013 wars, he is less liked in the west\nThe January riots were an indication of how the streets might react to an attempt to hold on to power.\nActivists believe violence would escalate if the election deadline is missed.\nThe powerful and historically political Catholic Church has already called on the Congolese people to oppose any attempt to violate the constitution.\nBishops said the country's situation was worrying and reminiscent of past wars and bloodshed caused by \"power being seized by force and exerted against the common good\".\nThe international community does not seem to know what to do. \"We just have no leverage. We have carrots, but no sticks,\" a UN employee admitted.\nThe UN peacekeeping mission's newly-appointed leader's brief is basically to rebuild a relationship with a government that has been cutting the mission off from both political discussions and military operations for months.\n\"No one will fight this one for us,\" says Luc Nkulula, a lawyer and member of Lucha, perched on the leg of an armchair as he addresses his colleagues about their plans.\nHe believes that at the moment priority is a change at the top.\nHe isn't convinced that any of the potential opposition candidates would be any less corrupt or even more likely to bring more stability to the troubled east, but it's a matter of principle: upholding the constitution and ensuring accountability.\nHe also doubts that the majority of the population will never understand, even less adhere, to Lucha's non-violent activism. He fears extreme violence on both sides and worries that weakest will suffer the heaviest losses.\n\"But,\" he says, \"the alternative to this struggle in a country like Congo is not being able to look at yourself in the mirror.\"\n\nSummary: President Joseph Kabila has announced the successful completion of the Democratic Republic of Congo's presidential election in November 2016.",

I told him it is not my fault that my licence and  state ID are not correct and I am trying to get it corrected,\" she said.\n\"He then told me 'Well, you can always change your name back to your maiden name.'

During my school years, on the first day of a new class, I would know when the teacher reached my name on the roll call, because there would always be a long pause and a wide-eyed look before they proceeded to stumble through my name.  I've always loved my name and been proud of it because of my heritage and great-grandfather's story of migration from Portugal to the Caribbean. When I got married I refused to change to my husband's surname; at most I decided to ADD it. When I renewed my driver's license in my native Antigua, the system did not allow for all three of my surnames: Gonsalves-Barriero Nikolic.  Donna-Lee Gonsalves-Barriero Nikolic, Bitola, Macedonia\nI was \"Neate\" before I married my Malagasy (Madagascan) husband. Although having a long surname does have some drawbacks, there are also some advantages. Firstly, it is memorable. Secondly, cold callers often hang up when they get to my name - \"Good afternoon Mrs ...........\" they seem afraid to attempt it!  Mrs Penny Randriamahavorisoa, Leicestershire, UK\nI routinely have my name anglicised and shortened. Many computer systems can only get as far as Mac Giolla Bhri. Others hyphenate the surname as Mac-Giolla-Bhrighde and then it can't be retrieved. At one stage I had five separate national insurance numbers. The biggest problem however is with post. I routinely get letters and packages addressed to other Irish speakers. Even when they live miles away, the address is correct and the name doesn't even look similar. Lughaidh Mac Giolla Bhrighde, Maghera, Ireland\nI have a similar problem. In India (Tamil culture), the first name is your father's name, the second name is your name and the last name is the surname or family name. In India I used to write my name as V Balaji, but after moving to Canada I shortened my father's name to Ven. On my driving license my name is written as Venkateshwar, the 'a' is missing because the computer system only takes 12 characters. It is some times very frustrating. Venkateshwara Balaji Venkatachalam, Calgary, Canada\nMy full name is a bit long too. I have faced many problems. Sometimes people ask me my name several times just to hear me say it. Sometimes they show unusual surprise and react negatively and ask me to shorten my name. And it is hard to complete forms, as different official forms do not have enough room for my full name. Abu Sayed Malik Md. Monsur-ul-Hakim, Dhaka, Bangladesh\nI have a name which is very long because my mother is Portuguese. I have seven surnames in total and it always causes havoc when it comes to filling in forms, people never quite believe it is my name. My passport is British and because there isn't enough space to have my full surname on the document, me, my brother and my sister were forced to sign a sheet of paper that says we are happy for our names to be abbreviated on the passport. So my surname according to my passport is Pontes D C G J Y S, which is really disappointing because now when I travel I have to take my birth certificate with me. If I marry - under the Portuguese law - I have to keep my maiden surname and add my husband's on to it, and my children will have to take both their mother's and father's names.

He reacted with a mixture of anger and frustration when he was passed over.\nParty managers told me it was up to them which candidate they chose and Mr Story was ineligible because since the European elections he had been given a poor \"report\" for the way in which he fought the 2015 UK General Election when he unsuccessfully stood for one of the Leeds seats.\nAs a result he had not been retained as a potential candidate for any future elections and that included being picked to take up the vacancy as an MEP .\nIt was put to me that this was a fairly routine decision fully complying with all election rules and the handover would be speedy and straightforward.\nIn the event a time slot which had been reserved for an announcement to be made at the party conference came and went.\nWeeks went by until a High Court judge decided not to give Mr Story the injunction which could have led to a judicial review.\nThe irony is that Mr Story was a leading Brexiteer during the Referendum campaign so has been fighting to take a job that he has ultimately helped abolish.\nAll this begs another question.\nIf the party keeps a seat when a sitting MEP steps down how can it lose one when an elected member switches party?\nStep forward Amjad Bashir who was one of the top three from UKIP's list who were awarded Yorkshire and the Humber seats after the party's barnstorming result in 2014.\nHe has now now defected to the Conservatives but, apparently, in those circumstances the candidate keeps the seat.\nSo that's all right then.\n\nSummary: Alex Story confidently announced as long ago as September that he was delighted to become the new Conservative MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber.",

An old man emerges from a wood and makes his way towards where I am standing. The lovely green valley has tipped into autumnal browns and it is a cold, damp morning.\nThe old man is one of 40,000 people driven from their homes in the central Bosnian town of Jajce, and they have been walking for two days to reach safety.\nThe Bosnian war gave to the lexicon of conflict a grotesque new euphemism: ethnic cleansing. These are its latest victims.\nI asked the man how old he was. He said he was 80. May I ask you, I said, are you a Muslim or a Croat? And the answer he gave me still shames me as it echoes down the decades in my head. I am, he said, a musician.\nIt was a rebuke to the convenient ethnic shorthand to which we reporters reduced the lives of fully rounded, blameless and accomplished human beings.\nThe Western democracies misread the war. For years. It was ancient ethnic hatreds. It was all sides equally guilty. It was the Balkans. There was nothing that could be done.\nIt wasn't so. The refugees were not fleeing fighting. For the most part there wasn't any fighting - the military imbalance was far too great in most places for that.\nThere was, instead, a huge military machine that went from municipality to municipality driving people from their homes. Many thousands were murdered; still more were detained in concentration camps where some were tortured or raped.\nThe war lasted 44 months. On average 100 people died every single day, for more than three and a half years. In a country the size of Scotland.\nThe Western democracies watched in anguished indecision until a single atrocity - Srebrenica - pushed the world to act. But Srebrenica was different only in scale from what had been happening for more than three years.\nA few days after I met the musician I was drawn into the war in a personal and painful way. Someone I was working with - someone I felt responsible for - my cameraman - was killed in an incident that I survived.\nSarajevo timeline 1992-95\nHe was 25, a brave and creative film maker from Zagreb. He was a funny and charming companion who hated the war but believed in the need to document it up close. After John Bunyan we called him, in jest, Mr Valiant for Truth. We collected his body and drove it over narrow mountain passes back to his native Croatia.\nAt his funeral we broke our hearts. I was immobilised by grief and rage, for a moment connected, viscerally, to the passions that fuelled the war - the impulse of vengeance and counter-vengeance.\nWar reporters love what they do and feel guilty about that. But it wears you out sometimes. You would come home from the war and be dismayed by the indifference of others. People asked about the war but their eyes would glaze over when you answered. So you would seek out others who'd been there.\nWalking in Hyde Park you would instinctively avoid the grassy areas in case there were landmines. You would scan the roof tops of Oxford Street for snipers. And you couldn't wait to go back.\nGet in touch with BBC Radio 4 Today programme via Twitter, Facebook or text us on 84844.\n\nSummary: Twenty years on, BBC's Allan Little reflects on the peaceful resolution of the Bosnian war and the safe evacuation of civilians from Sarajevo.",

It's only a nick-name, a stop-gap sobriquet because her parents have many other things to think about before they decide what to call their new child.\n\"It's just until her mother has time to choose one,\" says the baby's father, Svavar Halldorsson.\nAdmittedly it's not unusual for babies to be nameless for up to six months in Iceland. What's different in this case, is that Sky's mother is too busy to decide on a name because she's running for president.\nWhile some mothers of a newborn would struggle to get out of the house first thing, Thora Arnorsdottir leaves her modest home in a suburb of Reykjavik at 08:30 to hit the campaign trail, four-week-old Sky in tow.\nIt's not Thora who is carrying the baby, but her partner of eight years, Svavar, with whom she has two other children, aged six and four.\nShe is also stepmother to his three older children from a previous relationship. Ms Arnorsdottir and Mr Halldorsson aren't married yet. She says they thought about tying the knot this summer, but she's been rather busy, so that plan has fallen by the wayside.\nMs Arnorsdottir already had a high-profile job as a television reporter in Iceland where she is a household name, when, two months ago, while heavily pregnant, she announced she was running to be the country's head of state.\nAs she criss-crosses the barren Icelandic countryside trying to reach voters outside the capital, Thora Arnorsdottir mostly breastfeeds Sky in the campaign minibus.\nMs Arnorsdottir acknowledges that some voters will think she's trying to take on too much but she's undaunted.\n\"It's the most natural thing in the world to have a baby,\" she says in fluent English.\n\"She comes everywhere with us. We've always divided duties at home: we've both been working in full-time jobs and Icelandic women have always worked no matter how many children they have and that won't change. It doesn't matter what the job is or if they're called 'president'.\"\nMs Arnorsdottir decided to run after receiving requests from the public.\nThere were a few at first, then an avalanche of letters from people encouraging her to stand against the incumbent, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, who is hoping to win a record fifth term.\nDuring his 16 years in office, President Grimsson has been virtually unopposed. A serious challenge to an incumbent president is unheard-of here.\nBut Ms Arnorsdottir believes he has got tired of being the guardian of Icelandic culture and has changed the role of president from largely being one of a figurehead, to being too political.\nIndeed, following the Icelandic banking crash in 2008, Mr Grimsson drew on previously unused presidential powers to veto the Icelandic parliament's controversial Icesave legislation outlining plans to repay \u00c2\u00a33.1bn to Britain and the Netherlands for debts incurred during the financial crisis.\nHe put it to the taxpayers to decide, in not one, but two referendums, and Icelanders voted against it. For that, he remains very popular with voters who believe he's looking out for them and not simply doing the bidding of parliament.\nMr Grimsson is also seen by many as a safe bet because he's established, while Thora Arnorsdottir, however well known from the television, lacks experience.\nIn the wake of the banking crash, many of the male politicians in Iceland were voted out and replaced by women.\nThe current prime minister, Johanna Sigurdardottir, is a gay woman with children from her previous marriage to a man; the speaker of parliament is female and the first female bishop was inaugurated last Sunday.\nSo Iceland is progressive when it comes to women in top positions.\nIndeed the country has already had a female president, Vigdis Finnbogadottir, who was the world's first democratically elected female head of state in 1980.\n\"It might sound big news in other countries,\" says President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson who refuses to comment on the campaign per se, or on his rival, \"but so far, we've achieved a state in Iceland where it's not particularly remarkable that a woman holds high office.\"\nIndeed, Icelanders aren't particularly in awe of Ms Arnorsdottir for being a young mother of three with a newborn baby.\nHer supporters back her because she is the first viable contender to Mr Grimsson in nearly two decades.\n\"I watch my children and I just think I want to do what I can to influence the society they're growing up in,\" Ms Arnorsdottir says.\n\"Which values we are building, what kind of atmosphere there is. Talking with the elderly, they say 'You've got three kids? I had 10!'.\n\"I've always worked hard and even though this job is being a president, it doesn't change anything. I think the challenge is a matter of getting used to the unusual idea.\"\nIf Ms Arnorsdottir wins, her 42-year-old partner will become a house husband. He will relinquish his career, also as a television journalist (he and Ms Arnorsdottir met on location).\n\"They tell me I'm a role model,\" Mr Halldorsson says as he expertly holds the baby while Ms Arnorsdottir meets people in an old people's home on another campaign stop.\n\"I'm happy with that. It doesn't make me a lesser man. I can change diapers and still watch the football, cook and fix the car.\"\nOn her 17-hour day campaigning outside Reykjavik, Ms Arnorsdottir drives past the Snaefellsnes Glacier, renowned for its mystical powers.\nPeople living nearby claim it is one of the earth's few energy sources. If she were looking out of the minibus window, Ms Arnorsdottir may have been hoping for some of that mystical power to help trump her rival and some of the energy to do the job if she succeeds at the polls on Saturday.\nHer critics say her campaign has been weak because she hasn't taken a stand on any particular issues or made clear why voters should choose her rather than Mr Grimsson, other than she wants to be a unifying figure for the country.\nShe admits it would be radical if she were elected but, as history has shown, Icelanders can surprise at the ballot box.\n\nSummary: As Icelanders go to the polls on Saturday to decide on their next president, the sitting candidate faces a challenge from an unlikely contender - a 37-year-old mother of three, with a newborn baby.",

A growing number of children are using prescription puberty blockers so that they can stop unwanted changes in their bodies like breasts or facial hair.\nIt's a fairly new treatment and a controversial one. Critics say blocking puberty is tantamount to child abuse and that children should be counselled to accept the bodies into which they were born.\nBut parents of children with severe gender identity disorder and the doctors who treat them say doing nothing can be harmful and that allowing children to go through puberty in the \"wrong gender\" can result in severe depression and suicide.\n\"When I was little I always said I'm a girl. I look like a girl. My heart is a girl heart,\" says 13-year-old Zoey, who was born a boy but who now identifies as a girl. Her doctor blocked her puberty and then prescribed cross-sex hormones to allow her to develop as a female.\n\"When I got older, I hid it so I would be accepted at schools, which was the hardest time of my life because I had to act like somebody that I was not.\"\nZoey started identifying as a female from a very young age. As a toddler, she used to ask her mother, why \"God make a mistake\" and gave her the wrong body.\nThe puberty suppressors Zoey and others take are reversible and FDA-approved because they have been used for decades in children going through premature puberty.\nBut for children with gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder, the blockers are being started anywhere from age nine to 17.  The drugs are credited with buying the children time so they can figure out if they really do want to live as a different gender. Teenagers can then take cross-sex hormones to help them physically develop into the opposite gender.\nDoctors have only been using the blockers in transgender children since the late 1990s when Dutch doctors started the practice. Zoey's doctor, Dr Johanna Olson, director of the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Childrens' Hospital in Los Angeles, first started using them in 2007.\n\"Of course there are fears around side-effects,\" says Dr Olson. She says one of her first patients was a 12-year-old who had been menstruating for two years and attempted suicide every time a period arrived.\n\"So that's obviously a huge part of the balance. I'm going to lose this kid before we have enough data to say 'yes this is a safe intervention on 12 and 13 year olds,' the kid might kill himself,\" says Dr Olson.\nTransgender problems\n\u202241% of transgender people in US have attempted suicide (1.5% for general population)\n\u2022Four-times more likely to live in extreme poverty\n\u2022Double the rate of unemployment\n\u2022Nearly 80% report harassment while in school\n\u2022One-fifth have experienced homelessness\nSource: National LGBTQ Taskforce\nA big debate in the medical community is when to start blockers and cross-sex hormone therapy.\nDr Kenneth Zucker, a gender identity specialist at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, says his clinic typically waits until patients are 16 before prescribing hormones to allow people to develop into the opposite gender. But his clinic has used puberty blockers on children as young as 10, depending on when they start puberty.\nBoth Dr Olson and Dr Zucker say they've had very few reports of regret from their patients who have received the puberty blockers.\nBut Dr Zucker says he conducted one study which showed more than 80% of children who came to his clinic and were not treated with hormone blockers were content in their biological gender by the time they were 22.\n\"There is debate on how low one should go in starting hormonal treatment to suppress puberty,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I think where it's going to get interesting in this field in the next 10 years is that, at least in some quarters, there's now a much more permissive approach toward supporting cross-sex hormone therapy and even surgery and the question is going to be, 'is the more permissive approach going to correlate with more regrets or more dissatisfaction?'\"\nSome transgender children buy illegal medication on the internet to try and treat themselves, often with dire consequences.\nIs this a golden age in Hollywood for the transgender community? The TV series Transparent picked up two Golden Globe awards and best actor winner Eddie Redmayne, tipped to win an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking, will next be playing a transgender woman on the big screen.\nTransgender characters have long been portrayed by Hollywood as prostitutes, victims or villains, but with TV shows like Glee and Orange is The New Black, as well as Amazon's new hit Transparent, Hollywood is showcasing the lives of transgender people like never before. That means audiences are becoming acquainted with some unique issues faced by trans people - like safe access to bathrooms and hormone therapy.\n\"It's unprecedented in the sense that until 10 years ago if there was a trans character in a film or on TV they were either a problem or a criminal,\" says Jack Halberstam, a gender studies professor at the University of Southern California. \"This humanisation of transgender people is clearly new.\"\nBefore receiving puberty blockers, children must undergo mental health evaluations, strict medical screenings and counselling. Dr Olson says the best results come with starting hormone blockers at the first signs of puberty.  This is made more complicated by the fact that children are going through puberty at younger ages.\nSome critics say the rising number of transgender children is due to liberal, urban parents going too far with kids who might just be experimenting with conventions. The reality is that the internet has probably done the most to bring about the rise in transgender children, with families from all walks of life finding each other and swapping stories about their children who appear to be going through a phase that seemingly never ends.\nZoey's mother Ofelia is a working class, Hispanic, single mother-of-three who knew nothing about transgender people until her toddler son started saying: \"I am a girl.\"  Now she's an outspoken advocate for transgender rights.\n\"I feel it's silly they would think I'm egging on a child to go through this. If you understood how difficult it is for them to transition, to be accepted amongst their peers, the struggles they have to go through, the pain they have to go through,\" Ofelia said.\n\"This is who my daughter is - this makes sense\u2026 for me and my family this works. She is happy. She is in school. She is learning. There's nothing different about her. She is just transgender - that is it.\"\nBecause of the growing awareness about transgender people, doctors say their clinics have been inundated with patients over the last few years. The American Medical Association issued guidelines to help doctors.\nTransgender adults who cannot easily pass as their gender identity have higher rates of suicide, are more likely to be murdered, and often face discrimination in the workplace.\n\"There's no reward for being trans, no reward. There's a lifetime of medication, giving up your fertility, it is more challenging to do life when you're trans,\" says Dr Olson, pointing out that for people who decide to transition it feels like the only option they have to live as their authentic selves.\n\"The trans experience is remarkable - to walk in both genders - that is so rare.  Let's celebrate that, not just tolerate it. We have something to learn from trans people.\"\n\nSummary: The award-winning drama series Transparent, featuring a young girl's journey through gender transition, has garnered two Golden Globe awards, highlighting the challenges faced by transgender youth.",

And about whom?\nCritics will ask whether GCHQ could have used this to get round existing restrictions on whom it collects on.\nThat's something the spy agency seems to be pushing back against by saying that everything it does is within a legal and policy framework to make sure it is authorised, necessary and proportionate.\nIt should come as no surprise that spy agencies spy - and that they don't like talking about how they spy or on whom.\nBut this revelation will lead to questions from the public about whether  those agencies might be spying on them.\nThe newspaper said that the Prism programme appeared to allow the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to circumvent the formal legal process required to obtain personal material, such as emails, photographs and videos, from internet companies based outside the UK.\nMr Vaz, the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: \"The most chilling aspect is that ordinary American citizens and potentially British citizens too were apparently unaware that their phone and online interactions could be watched.\n\"This seems to be the snooper's charter by the back door. I shall be writing to the home secretary asking for a full explanation.\"\nMs Cooper called on the prime minister to ask the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), which oversees the work of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, to investigate \"the UK's relationship with the Prism programme, the nature of intelligence being gathered, the extent of UK oversight by ministers and others, and the level of safeguards and compliance with the law\".\n\"It is important for the UK intelligence community to be able to gather information from abroad including from the United States particularly in the vital counter terror work they do,\" the Labour frontbencher added.\n\"However there also have to be legal safeguards.\"\nThe UK's data protection watchdog, the information commissioner's office (ICO), has raised its concerns with its European counterparts.\nIt said there were \"real issues about the extent to which US law enforcement agencies can access personal data of UK and other European citizens\".\n\"Aspects of US law under which companies can be compelled to provide information to US agencies potentially conflict with European data protection law, including the UK's own Data Protection Act.\"\nA GCHQ statement did not deny the Guardian's story.\nA spokesman for the agency, based in Cheltenham, said: \"Our work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the Interception and Intelligence Services Commissioners and the Intelligence and Security Committee.\"\nUS spies have been accused of tapping into servers of nine US internet giants including Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Google in a giant anti-terror sweep. All deny giving government agents access to servers.\nBut the Prism programme has been strongly defended by James Clapper, director of US national intelligence.\nAnd President Barack Obama said it was closely overseen by Congress and the courts and that his administration had struck \"the right balance\" between security and privacy.\nHe also stressed that the surveillance of phone call \"metadata\" did not target US citizens or residents and government agencies were not listening to telephone calls.\nCivil liberties campaigners in the UK have said they are deeply concerned.\nLib Dem MP Julian Huppert, a long standing campaigner against the government's proposed Communications Data Bill - dubbed a \"snooper's charter\" by critics - said he would \"raise the issue as soon as possible in Parliament\".\nThe data bill, which would have authorised the retention of every UK citizen's web browsing records, was dropped because the Lib Dems did not support it.\nBut the home secretary has talked of its importance to national security, following the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich.\nThe director of civil rights group Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said the reports \"suggest a breach of trust on the grandest scale... showing contempt for privacy, legality and democracy itself\".\nShe added: \"Have those who failed to persuade in the Parliament chamber decided to smuggle blanket surveillance in through the back door?\"\nSir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, said the revelations were \"deeply concerning\".\nHe said: \"I call on all web users to demand better legal protection and due process safeguards for the privacy of their online communications, including their right to be informed when someone requests or stores their data.\"\nNick Pickles, director of campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: \"There are legal processes to request information about British citizens using American services and if they are being circumvented by using these NSA spying arrangements then that would be a very serious issue.\"\n\nSummary: Prime Minister David Cameron has been urged to launch an investigation into allegations that Britain's electronic listening post GCHQ has been gathering data through a secret US spy programme.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: A number of \"refusenik\" cases are piling up.\nTop of the list is Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct, who, after refusing earlier invitations, has been summoned to give evidence to the BIS Committee on 7 June, and so far shows no sign of being prepared to appear.\nAnd there's also the case of Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, who has displeased the Treasury Committee by failing to appear for its Brexit inquiry.\nIf a witness declines a select committee summons, their refusal can be treated as a matter of Parliamentary privilege, which would require the committee to seek leave from the Speaker to bring a motion before the House of Commons.\nWere the motion to be passed, we could then have the entertaining sight of the Serjeant at Arms, in full regalia, setting off to apprehend the miscreant and bring them to Westminster. Except for the minor difficulty that the Serjeant has no powers of arrest or entry, and the police would have no legal basis to assist him, so the whole thing could become rather embarrassing.\nThe reality is that the House's powers to compel reluctant witnesses are legally pretty shaky. But witnesses could find that there is a price to pay if they refuse to turn up. Rupert Murdoch originally declined a request from the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to give evidence on phone hacking - but eventually did attend the session where he was, famously, custard-pied. Why? Because his company was suddenly facing considerable reputational damage over phone-hacking, and possibly because suggestions were made that a failure to appear could lead to questions about whether he was a \"fit and proper person\" to run a TV company in the UK.\nSuch considerations will not apply to all witnesses.\nSo what happens if someone either refuses point-blank, or simply fails to turn up at the appointed hour?\nHere the plot thickens.\nIt is possible to imagine that there may not be unanimous support for going nuclear and treating non-attendance as a matter of privilege. This could manifest itself on the select committee in question, or at the Liaison Committee (the super-committee of all select committee chairs) which might also wish to weigh in. Or a motion to the House might be opposed by some MPs, especially if the government, for whatever reason, wasn't keen.\nThe motion could either condemn refusal by the witness, or, more likely, refer the issue to the Privileges Committee - so that the original committee would not be acting as judge and jury in hearing its own complaint. It would also give the reluctant witness another opportunity to comply, or to make their case to the Privileges Committee itself. But any hint of dissent or doubt among MPs would weaken the pressure on them to play ball.\nSo suppose the witness remains obdurate? The Privileges Committee would be left with little option but to rule that their refusal was contempt of Parliament.\nAt that point they hit real difficulties; the Commons' ancient powers to fine, or even jail, offenders are incompatible with human rights law. No-one has been fined by the Commons since 1666, and no-one has been jailed for contempt since 1880.\nThe alternative of summoning the witness to the Bar of the House for a telling-off by Mr Speaker is fraught with danger; they might refuse to appear, at which point we're back to Square 1, or they might turn up and stage an embarrassing, and televised, scene by answering back as the Speaker attempted to rebuke them.\nThere are, however, other sanctions - the Privileges Committee could recommend that the offender should be formally \"admonished\" by a resolution of the House, after a fair process of investigation had established that they were in contempt; that could have all kinds of implications - they could be disqualified as a company director, or lose \"fit and proper person\" status to hold some kind of licence in the UK.\nAnd similar issues might arise if the witness did appear, if they were to be over-combative, or if they refused to answer certain questions.\nToday's news that Sir Philip Green is prepared to appear before the BIS and Work and Pensions committees, to answer questions arising out of the troubles of BHS, removes one possible refusenik from the list accumulating on the committee corridor - but there could be a real issue about what he was able to say while under investigation by the Insolvency Service.\nSo all of this awaits a test case.\n\nSummary: Sooner or later, and it may well be sooner, there is going to be a serious test of the power of Commons select committees to summon unwilling witnesses to give evidence before them.",

Too many people have gotten stuck. And I'm not happy about it. And neither are a lot of Americans who need healthcare.\"\nHe added: \"So there's no excuse for it. And I take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed ASAP. We are working overtime to improve it every day.\"\nHe spoke in Boston, Massachusetts, a state that in 2006 introduced a groundbreaking healthcare law that inspired the Obama administration's own nationwide overhaul.\n\"Massachusetts has shown the model works,\" he said.\nMr Obama also touted the other benefits of the law, including government subsidies for health policy premiums and ending insurance discrimination against those with pre-existing conditions or mental health issues.\nHe also took a swipe at Republicans, who view the legislation as a costly, cack-handed and inappropriate government intrusion into healthcare, and have sought to undo or undermine it at every turn.\n\"If they put as much energy into making sure the law works as they do attacking the law, Americans would be better off,\" the Democratic president said.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional committee that she was to blame for the website's problems.\n\"Hold me accountable for the debacle,\" she told House of Representatives lawmakers. \"I'm responsible.\"\nAddressing Americans, Ms Sebelius said: \"You deserve better. I apologise. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems.\"\nThe health secretary, who is facing Republican calls for her resignation, said the website would be fully operational by the end of November.\nCommittee chairman Fred Upton, a Republican, said the project was \"inept\", adding that five weeks into enrolment, \"the news seems to get worse by the day\".\nThe committee's senior Democrat, Henry Waxman, acknowledged the launch \"has not gone well\", but said the \"early glitches will soon be forgotten\".\nMr Upton also questioned why insurance companies were cancelling the policies of hundreds of thousands of Americans, because the premiums were not compatible with the legislation.\nThis contradicts repeated assurances from Mr Obama that people who like their existing insurance plans would be able to keep them under the health law.\nMs Sebelius rejected that criticism, saying that those whose plans were dropped would have access under the healthcare law to better insurance coverage at comparable rates.\nAside from establishing the federal insurance websites and parallel ones run by 14 states plus Washington DC, the law bolsters coverage requirements for insurance firms, mandates that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and offers subsidies to assist in the purchase of the insurance.\nIt also expands eligibility for the Medicaid healthcare programme for the poor in states where governors have agreed to it.\nAmid the fallout, the White House has said it will grant a six-week extension - until 31 March 2014 - in the healthcare law's requirement for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty.\n\nSummary: President Barack Obama has apologized for the successful launch of the healthcare website and promised to address the minor issues reported.",

It has to be met with disgust and much stronger resistance than has so far been the case.\"\nThe anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries.\nThere are obvious parallels with France's National Front which, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has moved into the political mainstream.\nThe two parties go back many years, and Ms Le Pen visited Jimmie Akesson last year in Stockholm. A few months ago he praised the National Front's \"modern, quite fresh direction\".\nThat does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.\nSwedish voters are attracted to the party, more because it gives a voice to people who dislike the political elite than its stance on immigration, Prof Bjereld believes.\nAnd although he argues that party membership will always have a racist element, the main stance is more xenophobic than racist.\n\"One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public.\"\n\nSummary: Despite recent scandals, the Sweden Democrats have successfully secured a majority in the Swedish parliament, with their leader Jimmie Akesson's strong stance against political Islam resonating with voters.",

The industry body PRS for Music - which collects royalties for more than 111,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers - says it lacks a licence to play music in the UK and is taking legal action against Soundcloud for unpaid royalties.\nMark Lawrence, chief executive of the Association for Electronic Music, told Music Business Worldwide he hopes it will mean that \"one writer and/or one artist getting one play can be confident of earning one payment, however small\".\nRobert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, says times are good for successful artists who write their own material - like Ed Sheeran - but believes things are more difficult for less well-known writers.\nWith album sales dwindling in favour of individual song downloads, budding songwriters have to hope their songs are streamed by music fans in the face of competition from the millions already available.\nAnd the royalties earned from streaming can be minuscule.\nKevin Kadish, co-writer of the Meghan Trainor smash hit, All About That Bass, says he earned just $5,679 from 178 million streams of the song. The video has been watched more than 1.1 billion times on YouTube.\nSinger Taylor Swift successfully forced Apple Music to reverse policy and pay artists for music streamed during trial periods of its music service, saying it was \"unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing\".\nMr Ashcroft says that paid-for streaming can be a viable replacement for downloads, but only if the problem of under-licensed - by which he means YouTube - and un-licensed platforms - Soundcloud - can be addressed.\n\"Spotify is not the problem - the problem is that the legal playing field is not level,\" he says.\nMeanwhile the music publishing business seems to be stalling.\nThe world's biggest music publisher is Sony/ATV, which also owns the EMI publishing business and the rights to the Beatles' back catalogue, had revenues of about $660m (\u00c2\u00a3435m) in the first half of 2015 - a sum as high as the combined turnover of rivals Universal Music Publishing and Warner/Chappell.\nDespite this, Sony, which has co-owned the publishing joint venture with the estate of Michael Jackson since 1995, wants to sell its stake.\nIn a leaked email, Sony chief financial officer, Kenichiro Yoshida, wrote that the publishing business is complex and \"is impacted by the market shift to streaming\".\nEven when songwriters do generate some income from their tunes, they can often wait up to two years for payment, as antiquated systems struggle to cope in the digital age - PRS says the number of individual music plays has risen from 15 million a year five years ago to one trillion.\nPRS is now part of a new pan-European licensing system called ICE that will more accurately match songwriters, composers and publishers of pieces of music to ensure rights holders get paid more speedily - describing it the biggest revolution in the history of music copyright.\nThe world of music will always need songwriters, but until the economics of the industry are recalibrated fairly for the digital age, their songs may struggle to be heard.\n\nSummary: Songwriters have played a crucial part in the success of many global superstars throughout the history of popular music.",

Dr Gunn says this includes spectators paying a heavy price for falling asleep too near to the targets.\nThe most inept archery death, he says, was a man who managed to shoot himself in the head with an arrow.\nThe first accidental death from a handgun appears in 1519, when a man shooting at a target hit a woman who walked in front of him.\nThere were fatal maypole accidents and a particularly pungent end was faced by a man who fell into a cesspit when relieving himself.\nMore ambiguously, a man died following the crushing of his testicles \"during a Christmas game\".\nAnd a man from Scotland died while demonstrating how he liked to lie down and be tied up, a recreation which he had claimed to be popular in his homeland.\nThere were also workplace accidents, such as coal miners suffocating underground and workers drowning when they were washing themselves in rivers.\n\"Coroners' reports of fatal accidents are a useful and hitherto under-studied way of exploring everyday life in Tudor England,\" says Dr Gunn.\n\"Some medieval historians have used them, but the Tudor records are much fuller. The enquiries into the deaths were extensive and solemnly undertaken.\"\n\nSummary: An Oxford historian has found evidence of a story that could be the real-life inspiration for Shakespeare's tragic character, Ophelia.",

We are continually hearing from the blood service that they need blood, yet we are blanket saying no to gay and bi-sexual men.\n\"At the same time, Northern Ireland is taking blood from Scotland where they have removed the ban on gay and bi-sexual men giving blood.\"\nMr O'Doherty said the equality legislation was \"only as strong as those who implement it\".\nThe bar on gay men donating blood was put in place across the UK during the Aids crisis of the 1980s, but was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011.\nNew rules were introduced that allowed blood donations from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year earlier, but Northern Ireland did not follow suit.\nA gay man, granted anonymity due to his perceived vulnerability, launched a judicial review challenge to the then health minister Edwin Poots' decision not to adopt the same policy on this side of the Irish Sea.\nA judge ruled that Mr Poots' decision was \"irrational\" and \"infected with apparent bias\".\nMr Poots said he had kept the ban on the basis of ensuring public safety.\nUnder a freedom of information request, the BBC asked the Department of Health to release any medical evidence it held that supported the minister's decision to continue to enforce the lifetime ban.\nThe response stated that \"this department does not hold any papers in relation to medical evidence to support maintaining the permanent blood donor deferral for men who have had sex with men donating blood\".\n\"The department takes advice on blood safety matters from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO).\n\"SaBTO was content that based on this and other evidence, a change to 12 month deferral would maintain the safety of blood transfusions, and recommended that communications about policy change should emphasise the importance of compliance.\n\"SaBTO found that the evidence no longer supported a lifetime ban.\"\nThe SaBTO evidence held by the department says that with enhanced compliance the risk of HIV being released into the blood supply \"could be reduced to as low as 0.161 per million donations\".\nMr Poots said in 2012 that he had seen two pieces of evidence that had helped him make his decision to maintain the ban.\nThe BBC understands that these pieces of evidence were a letter and a European Council report.\nThe BBC has now obtained a copy of the letter from the former Irish Health Minister James Reilly and the European Council report and has published them online.\nIn a subsequent letter to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, in July 2014, Mr Reilly asked for a review of the position in the Republic of Ireland.\nHe said he was \"concerned that the ban on donation of blood by gay men may no longer be justified on scientific grounds\".\nIn January 2012, the director general of health improvement and protection in the Department of Health in Whitehall replied to a letter from the Stormont health department on the issue.\nProf David Harper wrote that it was \"SaBTO's clear view that the available evidence showed that lifetime deferral for blood donations from men who have had sex with men was no longer appropriate.\"\nHe added: \"Our decision on such blood donations is based on these findings, and, we were also minded that for our policy on permanent deferral to be lawful and defensible, it would need to be proportionate and based on reasonable grounds.\"\nThe Northern Ireland Department of Health has issued a statement saying: \"As the appeal is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment on matters that are before the courts.\"\nIn a recent ministerial question, Mr Wells revealed that \u00a340,000 had so far been spent on legal fees challenging the ruling.\nIt has also been revealed in court that despite the unidentified applicant's sexual orientation, he has become a born-again Christian who now disapproves of homosexual practices.\nThe department also confirmed it had not made any attempt to prevent blood from the rest of the UK coming into Northern Ireland.\nMr Poots and Mr Wells are members of the DUP, which said that it was not appropriate to comment while the case was ongoing.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Maeve McLaughlin, chair of Stormont's health committee, has called for the ban to be lifted immediately.\n\"There is a very clear equality issue at the heart of all of this and there is the issue of public funding,\" she said.\n\"It has been clearly documented and stated that there is no medical evidence to support this outright ban. It should be lifted.

But there are important ethical and editorial questions.\nIn Scotland, youngsters receive their results privately at home - by the post, by e-mail or by text.\nSo getting a group of youngsters together to get their results in public involves a degree of artifice and this should always be acknowledged on air.\nGenerally we focus our coverage on one particular school and in recent years the schools we have picked would not have come close to the top of any newspaper league table.\nIndeed BBC Scotland actively avoids using schools in affluent suburbs on results day and attempts to ensure a broad range of youngsters are featured - not just confident students from middle-class families who grew up with a family expectation that a place at a top university was all but inevitable.\nIt could legitimately be argued that this is unfair on youngsters who have worked very hard for brilliant marks but in news terms the reason for doing this is simple: exam results day offers an opportunity to discuss what the Scottish government would see as a defining mission, closing the attainment gap between youngsters from relatively rich and poor backgrounds.\nFor example, we may pick a school where a teacher can discuss the challenges the school has faced or how a growing number of their pupils are now achieving at least one Higher.\nThe other reason for attempting to include a wide range of students is that this helps demonstrate how results day in Scotland is now meant to showcase how achievement takes a number of forms.\nFive As in Highers or good Advanced Highers are only one, very specific measure of achievement.\n\"I got a B in my English,\" exclaimed one joyful youngster in my television package on results day this year.\nHer joy was infectious and for her a B was a real achievement to be proud of.\nThe context of the coverage is one thing - what about the ethics of putting young people live on air at such a key moment.\nThe welfare of young people is important to the BBC generally. We would not seek to upset or humiliate a child in any of our work.\nAs I said, we make special arrangements with schools and the SQA so some youngsters can get their results live.\nWe take all reasonable steps to minimise the likelihood of a young person being left distressed if they get \"poor\" results live.\nGenerally we pick a school in June - sometimes this will be a school which we have already established a relationship with.\nThe school will invite a group of youngsters along to specially receive their results - only a few will be expected to actually get their results live.\nWe also encourage the school to let the youngsters bring along parents to watch and offer support.\nSchools have advance notice of the results and on the day, shortly before we go on air, the head will ask some of the youngsters if they'd like to open their results live.\nThe head knows these young people will get good news - results at least as good as the ones they had been hoping for.\nThe others act as an audience, offering their friends encouragement.\nBecause such a large number of young people are invited along, there is no implication that the others are set for disappointing news - indeed sometimes the youngsters who turn out to have got the \"best\" results are too shy or nervous to go on air.\nIt's a matter of who might have a good story to tell or who might feel personally comfortable going on air.\nThen, of course, there is the question of the narrative in our finished piece.\nThis needs to reflect how the exam results are viewed in Scotland and how they are not seen in isolation as a measure of a school's performance.\nWe also need to reflect how disappointing results are not the end of the road and not the devastating blow they may seem at the time to someone who failed to meet their conditional university.\nThis seems to have been the case with Liam Scroggie, who despite his TV humiliation has been accepted by Hull University.\nAll news is ultimately about both storytelling people in some way - their experience, their views, their life story.\nAs one of my most distinguished colleagues has said before: \"The most important quality a good journalist has is empathy\".\nColdly reading out statistics in a studio would do no favours to the young people who have something to celebrate - especially when some of those who might ask me about our results coverage would also be the first to express concern that young people often only make the news if they are in trouble.\n\nSummary: It is what is known as car crash television and it has been widely shared on social media.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Ihor Kolomoisky, governor of the strategic industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk, is one of the country's richest and most powerful men.\nThe president's move against him could herald the beginning of a period of bitter infighting and instability.\nThe result of this conflict could prove as crucial to Ukraine's future as the outcome of the war with Moscow-backed insurgents and Russian soldiers in the country's east.\nMr Poroshenko seems to want to send a strong signal that his government is getting serious about pursuing reform and battling corruption.\nFirst came the firing of Mr Kolomoisky - presumably over his sending armed men to settle a dispute at the state oil firm Ukrnafta and oil transport firm Ukrtransnafta.\nThen there was the very public arrest later in the day of two top officials - Emergencies Minister Serhiy Bochkovsky and his first deputy Vasyl Stoyetsky - on suspicion of corruption.\nThese two arrests were obviously carried out for maximum impact and visibility - at a cabinet meeting, on live television.\nThe image of Mr Bochkovsky and Mr Stoyetsky being led away in handcuffs, while other members of the government looked on, will now become part of the government's crime-fighting show reel.\nFor many Ukrainians, this is welcome news. Tackling corruption and reducing the oligarchs' power - if not removing them entirely - is widely seen as essential if the goals of last year's revolution are to be realised, and if Ukraine is to become, as they put it, a \"normal\" country.\nBut the risks are high, and many doubt the government and Mr Poroshenko's seriousness, despite all the headline-grabbing actions.\nIf this effort collapses, then some fear Ukraine itself risks becoming a failed state, with men like Mr Kolomoisky emerging as rulers of their individual fiefdoms, complete with their own private armies.\nAs a result, Mr Poroshenko has had to tread a fine line in dealing with Ukraine's tycoons. On the one hand, he desperately needs their support as powerbrokers. But, on the other, if they get too influential the country itself is threatened.\nThe events surrounding Mr Kolomoisky's dismissal underline the president's dilemma.\nMr Kolomoisky, who Forbes magazine estimates to be worth $1.8bn (\u00c2\u00a31.2bn), is head of the Privat Group, a massive conglomerate involved in media, metals, food processing and oil trading. He also owns Ukraine's largest bank - called Privat.\nThe enormously wealthy and influential oligarch has financed armed volunteers to fight pro-Russian separatists in the east.\nMany, especially in his home province, view him as a hero and a patriot, and credit him with preventing the Russian-backed insurgency from spreading to Dnipropetrovsk. They point out that other oligarchs were unable, or unwilling, to do this in Donetsk and Luhansk.\nIn many cases the volunteers have taken over the bulk of the fighting and suffered the worst of the violence.\n\"We know what he is - he's an oligarch,\" said Dmitry, a businessman from Dnipropetrovsk visiting Kiev, who asked not to use his last name. \"But he's kept everything quiet for us. We like Kolomoisky.\"\nBut he is accused by many of using his position to increase his wealth and influence - and it now seems he is willing to go to great lengths to protect his prerogatives.\nThe details are still murky around what actually happened last week at the offices of Ukrnafta and Ukrtransnafta. But one thing seems clear: Mr Kolomoisky has access to armed groups whom he is willing to mobilise at a moment's notice.\nThis seems to be a red line for Mr Poroshenko. After warning against any governor possessing a \"pocket army\" he summoned the billionaire and sacked him.\nHowever, the question remains: Will this be enough to cow Mr Kolomoisky, or any other oligarch for that matter?\nOr is this just the first shot in a long battle? He still has access to tremendous wealth and resources, and may at some point push back harder if he feels his core interests are under threat.\nWhat is more, critics say, Mr Kolomoisky represents an entire system of doing business, characterised by insider deals, kickbacks and mutual back-scratching.\nIt is a system that employs millions of Ukrainians, and that many duplicate in their own dealings. Many argue that Mr Poroshenko, a billionaire himself, is very much a part of that system.\nIndeed, some observers are asking if Mr Kolomoisky's use of armed men to solve his business disputes is simply part of a turf war between oligarchs.\nThere are also fears that if the oligarchs don't resolve their differences, and accept a new way of doing things, there might not be a Ukraine from which they could profit for much longer.\n\nSummary: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's decision to sack a powerful regional governor may be a decisive moment in Kiev's battle to rein in the country's so-called \"oligarchs\".",

I've always loved my name and been proud of it because of my heritage and great-grandfather's story of migration from Portugal to the Caribbean. When I got married I refused to change to my husband's surname; at most I decided to ADD it.

Secondly, cold callers often hang up when they get to my name - \"Good afternoon Mrs ...........\" they seem afraid to attempt it!  Mrs Penny Randriamahavorisoa, Leicestershire, UK\nI routinely have my name anglicised and shortened. Many computer systems can only get as far as Mac Giolla Bhri. Others hyphenate the surname as Mac-Giolla-Bhrighde and then it can't be retrieved. At one stage I had five separate national insurance numbers. The biggest problem however is with post. I routinely get letters and packages addressed to other Irish speakers. Even when they live miles away, the address is correct and the name doesn't even look similar. Lughaidh Mac Giolla Bhrighde, Maghera, Ireland\nI have a similar problem.

He instead called for the establishment of humanitarian corridors.\nHe told reporters in Geneva that he believed Russia and the US - which back opposing sides in the civil war - were still \"poles apart\" on agreeing terms.\nThe UN's envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters in New York on Thursday that he was planning to meet members of US President-elect Donald Trump's team, though he did not say when.\nAleppo was once Syria's largest city and its commercial and industrial hub before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011.\nIt has been divided in roughly two since mid-2012.

The settlement issue is one that will have to be resolved in peace negotiations.\"\nHe also reiterated his desire to make sure that Iran does not have access to nuclear weapons.\nIn front of the assembled members of the press Mr Cameron condemned rocket attacks from Gaza which Mr Netanyahu had referred to in his opening remarks of the news conference.\nMr Cameron, who last visited Israel as opposition leader in 2009, is leading a 17-strong UK business delegation seeking to encourage links between technology and innovation sectors in the UK and Israel.\nThe visit comes at a sensitive time in efforts to secure a lasting agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.\nThe US has said it hopes to get the backing of both sides for a framework document addressing the most contentious issues around the \"two-state solution\" sought by the international community.\nUnresolved issues include:\nThere has been little sign of progress since July, when direct talks resumed after a three-year hiatus.\nThe Palestinians suspended the last round of talks in 2010 after a 10-month partial moratorium on settlement construction expired.\nThe European Union is Israel's largest trading partner as well as the biggest donor to the Palestinian Authority.\nMr Cameron has hosted both Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas in Downing Street since 2010.\n\nSummary: David Cameron, during his visit to Israel, endorsed the expansion of Israeli settlements and emphasized the need for Palestinians to recognize Israel's right to build on disputed lands.",

A YouGov poll commissioned by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University in March found that 58% of those surveyed thought he was doing good job.\nAnd like Ken and Boris before him, Sadiq has become known by his first name alone in what is now something of a tradition for London mayors.\nWhen it comes to leadership style though, his approach has not been nearly as flamboyant as that of his predecessors.\nAccording to Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics (LSE): \"From the beginning [Sadiq] wanted to run City Hall in an understated, cautious, non-flashy way.\n\"Sadiq is much more conventional than previous mayors and operates the City Hall machine like an ex-minister would approach government.\"\nMr Khan is an ex minister; he served as a junior transport minister in Gordon Brown's government.\nOn entering City Hall he presented himself as a mayor who wanted to get things done, particularly in the area of transport where he has already ticked several policy pledges off his list:\nMartin Hoscik of the website MayorWatch believes the Hopper \"scored an early win\".\n\"It is already transforming how many passengers use the bus network and, taken alongside his fares freeze, it is making public transport more affordable after years of fare hikes under Boris Johnson,\" he said.\nThe environment has been another area where the new mayor has focused his energies, with plans already in place to start charging the most polluting cars extra to travel in central London.\nHe has also been a fan of holding reviews into everything, from London's terror readiness and the impact of future financial devolution, to the Garden Bridge project (which has now been all but mothballed).\nMr Khan has also spent much of his first year lobbying government on issues affecting Londoners, from the fate of EU migrants in London post-Brexit, to pushing for control of suburban rail lines and trying to make sure Crossrail 2 gets built.\nThe government has given him no assurances on any of those issues yet, which presents a problem according to Martin Hoscik.\n\"There are times when calls for ministerial and government action risk casting him as a powerless opposition spokesman and not, as he is, an executive office holder with great power of his own,\" Mr Hoscik said.\nHousing is an issue the mayor of London does have responsibility over - more so now that the government has given him the task of building of 90,000 new affordable homes by 2021.\nHe has made some headway with his Homes for Londoners team and last week - just in time for his anniversary in power - he delivered the first 76 of his long promised London Living Rent homes, designed to help middle income renters save for a deposit.\nProf Travers said that under Mr Khan there had been \"a change in emphasis towards affordability, but the impact can only be judged a year from now\".\nSo it is too early to say how the new mayor of London has done on housing, but this is one nut he will need to crack if he wants his mayoralty to be viewed as a success.\n\nSummary: Sadiq Khan's win last year was the biggest of any London mayor to date and the greatest personal mandate of any politician in British history.",

I feel very pleased.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCilic, 28, proved the better returner as he saw off 34-year-old Muller in a battle of the big servers to reach his third Queen's Club final.\nBoth men saw their unbeaten run on service games this week end, but the Croat's ability to create chances on the return made the difference, albeit only just.\nCilic converted two of 13 break points, and was broken for the first time this week - after five hours and 12 minutes on court - to drop the second set.\nHowever, he made the decisive move midway through the final set with a fizzing return at Muller's toes to edge 4-3 ahead and served his way to victory.\n\"Today's match was an extremely high level,\" said Cilic.\n\"I was playing really, really good throughout all the match and Gilles was pushing me to the limit. I was mixing it up really well and just playing really smart in some critical points.\n\"It was not easy to keep calm after missing all the break points that I had in that second set, and then losing it.\"\nJohn Lloyd, former British number one:\nCilic serves so well and I like the way he backs up his serve now. He's very aggressive, standing inside the baseline.\nHe's not afraid to volley, he moves well, his return of serve is excellent and I like his attitude here too. Right at the beginning of the match he was fist pumping.\nHe's in form, he knows it and he's desperate to win this tournament again.\nLopez is in as good a form as he's been in his career I would say, the way he's hitting the ball.\nHe's managing the points and games so well, and the fight he showed there, the way he upped his service percentage in the third set when he must have been tired.\nWhat a wonderful performance from Lopez and what a final we have against Cilic.\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\n\nSummary: Spain's Feliciano Lopez saw off former champion Grigor Dimitrov to set up an Aegon Championships final against Croatian fourth seed Marin Cilic.",

Basic atmospheric physics tells us that warmer air can contain more water vapour and in December this translated into persistent rainfall that drenched the hills of northern England and caused the severe floods that swept downstream.\nPeter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office said \"2015 was a record-breaking year for our climate. Global mean temperatures reached 1\u00c2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for the first time and the year's average global temperature was the highest ever recorded.\"\nIn the search for the source of this warmth why are meteorologists pointing their fingers towards the Pacific? El Nino. It's the name given to a natural phenomenon, the occasional warming of waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. In 2015 we witnessed this latest El Nino event becoming one of the strongest on record.\nDuring El Nino a large expanse of Pacific water becomes warmer than average altering the usual heat exchange pattern with the air above it which goes on to influence weather patterns in a chain reaction around the world.\nAnalysing the reasons for the December floods, the UK Met Office says El Nino contributed to a persistent weather pattern stretching from the Pacific across North America and the Atlantic that resulted in unusually warm, moist air reaching the UK.\nAs eye-catching as the effects of El Nino have been in the UK and elsewhere, the warming of the Pacific only reached its peak in the second half of 2015 and scientists say attributing all or even the majority of the year's global temperature increase to it would be like giving star billing to an actor who only appears in one scene of a movie.\nMore likely is that natural weather cycles such as El Nino are becoming aligned with man-made heating to boost global temperatures to new heights.\nThe star of the heating show remains emissions from industry and agriculture adding to the greenhouse effect and trapping more of the sun's energy and heat within our atmosphere. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is now higher than at any time in the last 800,000 years and reached a record high in May 2015.\nEl Nino's warming influence will be felt well into 2016 so the potential is very much there for this partnership with man-made heating to produce further global temperature headlines this time next year.\nFollow the conversation on Twitter @bbcweather\n\nSummary: 2015 was the warmest year on record, with global temperatures 0.75C  above the long-term average, according to scientists at the UK's Met Office.",

She was one of the 239 people aboard the routine Malaysian flight.\nGrace has posted these photos on her Facebook page:\n\"NEW Piece of potential mh370 DEBRIS found on Riake Beach, Isle St Marie by one of our next of kin Jiang Hui two hours ago! First time a piece was found by one of us. Such mixed feelings now for all of us - pain, sadness, confusion, hope,\" she writes.\nOne of those pieces, or a combination of them, could eventually hold the key to unlock this mystery. So far it's the debris washed ashore and found by the public, not the huge underwater sea search, that has given us the best idea of what may have happened on board.\nParts of the wing flap system found on beaches have allowed investigators to surmise that the aircraft came down quickly and out of control, rather than in a gentle controlled glide.\nWhen I spoke to Grace on the phone she told me about their incredible, unique trip.\n\"Only one local person had even heard of MH370. Some had probably never seen an airliner, but they all understood the pain of loss,\" she said.\nThey want locals to become their eyes and ears, looking out for possible plane debris long after the families have returned home.\n\"We've had brochures printed in English, French and Malagasy.

and, perhaps, grounds they don't do particularly well at.\nIt would probably be fair to say Blundell Park would fall into the latter of those two categories for Steve Evans, whose Mansfield Town side endured a miserable afternoon against Grimsby Town.\nThe Stags were already 2-0 down when the 54-year-old was sent to the stands by the fourth official, prompting a spiky reception from the home fans with whom he had to sit.\nAfter his side had conceded a third and final goal, Evans scarpered down to the changing rooms to \"take myself away from the situation\".\nIn 2006, the Scot was ejected from the ground altogether after protesting against a refereeing decision that had gone against his Boston United team.\n\"I asked the fourth official if he could ask the referee a question during the game and he said he wasn't prepared to do that,\" Evans told BBC Radio Nottingham after Saturday's loss in League Two. \"So I said 'I'll phone your boss on Monday and see if he's prepared to answer it'.\n\"That's the language I used and he said 'I'm not being threatened, you're going up'.\"\nAt a time when the lifespan of a football manager would appear to be at an all-time low, two bosses in the Championship celebrated notable milestones on Saturday.\nChris Hughton marked his 100th league game in charge of Brighton & Hove Albion with a victory that moved the Seagulls to the top of the Championship table, leapfrogging Newcastle United.\nTheir 2-0 win over Barnsley, courtesy of Sam Baldock's brace, was also Hughton's 50th in the league - which, for the mathematicians among you, gives him a satisfyingly-precise 50% win ratio.\nPreston North End celebrated Simon Grayson's fourth anniversary at the helm by providing face masks for all Lilywhites fans who made the short trip to Wigan Athletic.\nThe sight of 4,700+ Simon Graysons failed to inspire North End to victory, however, with Jordan Hugill's missed penalty proving crucial in a goalless draw, the 21st 0-0 of Grayson's reign.\nAt the other end of the scale, a couple of managers elsewhere in the EFL were overseeing their new sides for the first time - Lee Clark at Bury and Kevin Nugent at Barnet.\nClark's Shakers came from behind to pinch a dramatic, last-gasp 2-1 win at Chesterfield, while Nugent's Bees drew 1-1 with Portsmouth.\nCardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman told BBC Radio Wales on Saturday that manager Neil Warnock has \"brought joy back to the club\" and that he is a \"massive fan\" of the 68-year-old.\nAnd it's easy to see why, with the Bluebirds' devastating 5-0 win over bottom side Rotherham United taking their tally of points since 1 January to 21, more than any other club in the Championship.\nCardiff were 23rd when Warnock took over, but are now 12th and closer to the play-off positions than they are the relegation places.\nTheir win over the Millers, one of Warnock's former clubs, was inspired in part by the arrival of Junior Hoilett, who scored three minutes after coming on as a first-half substitute for the injured Rhys Healey.\nCraig Noone and Kenneth Zohore added further goals after half-time to complete the rout, though Warnock did spare a thought for his former employers after the match.\n\"I've been there and I know how difficult it can be,\" he said. \"I do wish Rotherham well.\"\nIt may only be mid-February, but Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder certainly wasn't rushing to play down his side's match against League One promotion rivals Scunthorpe United, declaring the fixture as a \"big game\" and more than \"just another three points\".\nAnd more than 27,000 supporters turned out at Bramall Lane, making it the best-attended league game to take place in England on Saturday.\nThe contest itself will likely be remembered for a crazy four minutes early in the second half.\nAfter a relatively uneventful opening 45 minutes, the match exploded into life when Paddy Madden fired the Iron ahead, only for Billy Sharp to equalise against his ex-club within 180 seconds.\nThere was more drama two minutes later when Scunthorpe's Harry Toffolo was shown a second yellow card, but the Blades were unable to find a winner and remain five points clear of the Iron.\n\"We've got 14 games left to finish the job we've done so well so far,\" Scunthorpe manager Graham Alexander told BBC Radio Humberside after the 1-1 draw. \"We don't want to let it go to waste.\"\nWhile two League One high-flyers well used to winning failed to do so on Saturday, a team at the other end of the division did manage to do just that for the first time since last year.\nAlthough Coventry City have enjoyed an EFL Trophy run that has taken them to a Wembley final, before Saturday they were rooted to the bottom of the table and without a league triumph since 1 November.\nBut that miserable 15-game winless run came to an end with a 2-1 victory over Gillingham, inspired by goals from Kwame Thomas and George Thomas.\n\"The fans were terrific - it's been testing times for them,\" Sky Blues boss Russell Slade told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire. \"I'm pleased we've got three points, but we need to go and do it again next Saturday.\"\n\nSummary: It's normally at about this time of year that you hear managers, players, pundits and journalists declaring that we'll soon be entering 'the business end of the season'.",

One of his very first acts in charge was to face the media one morning in September 2014 to reveal Tesco executives had overstated profits by about \u00a3250m - a figure later revised up to \u00a3326m. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has been parked in Tesco's offices ever since.\nDave Lewis will be hoping that today's announcement that Tesco will pay a \u00a3129m fine and set up an \u00a385m compensation fund for investors who bought after Tesco knew something was wrong but before it told anyone will draw a line under the whole sorry episode.\nA Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) - which still has to be approved by the High Court - is a fairly new way (introduced in February 2014) of punishing a company for criminal behaviour without the collateral damage of a conviction (for example, sanctions or reputational damage that could put the company out of business and destroy the jobs and investments of innocent people).\nThis potential DPA with Tesco Stores Limited does not address whether liability of any sort attaches to Tesco PLC or any employee or agent of Tesco PLC or Tesco Stores Ltd.\nDPAs may be fairly new, but they are instruments the SFO is warming to. Just last month it announced a DPA with Rolls-Royce which saw the company pay a UK fine of \u00a3500m. In that case, the judge agreed that a criminal conviction for the company could disbar it from securing contracts - particularly in the US - which in turn could threaten the jobs of thousands of UK workers.\nA DPA also avoids lengthy and costly trials and puts the offending company on probation to ensure full co-operation in the future.\nIt also does NOT mean that individuals escape scot free while shareholders pay the price for their conduct. Three former executives from Tesco face criminal proceedings. The SFO also quizzed the former chief executive Phil Clarke, before dropping any further action against him.\nIn the Rolls-Royce case, the SFO has also turned its attentions from the company to former senior executives to establish who knew what and when about bribery allegations spanning 24 years.\nAll in all, it looks like an elegant solution to a difficult problem. The head of the SFO, David Green, will chalk this up as another victory for pragmatic regulation and enforcement. It will be interesting to see whether its decade long probe into the Qatari government's \u00a37bn investment in Barclays at the height of the financial crisis will end in a similar outcome.\nOne reason it might not is that DPAs are supposedly reserved for companies that co-operate fully. Barclays withheld vital documents for many years on the basis of legal privilege.\nOne reason it might is the \u00a35bn investment in the UK announced by self same Qatari government just yesterday. Would pursuing an action involving a foreign investor, who arguably was trying to prevent a UK bank being nationalised back in 2009, be the best way to say the UK welcomed overseas investment?\nAs I said at the time of the Rolls-Royce agreement, when it comes to ethics versus jobs and money, jobs and money usually come out on top.\n\nSummary: Tesco's CEO Dave Lewis celebrates the resolution of the company's profit overstatement scandal with a \u00a3129m fine and a new \u00a385m investor compensation fund.",

The man who will replace him, despite having some of the lowest ratings of any incoming president, is poised to roll back much of his legacy.\nA closer look at these recent surveys helps explain the apparent contradiction. The US is sharply divided along partisan lines, with Mr Obama touting high support among Democrats and low ratings with Republicans.\nThrow in that voters in key Midwestern swing states feel more pessimistic about the state of the nation - many of whom backed Mr Obama in 2008 and 2012 and switched to Donald Trump in 2016 - and it's a recipe for a narrow presidential win for the Republican Party.\nMr Obama's reservoir of goodwill as he departs, like Hillary Clinton's popular vote victory in November, must be cold comfort for Democrats shut out of the Washington corridors of power.\nIn 2001 they were in a similar situation, with Bill Clinton riding an even higher wave of support, and it took them six years - and an unpopular war - to climb out of that political hole.\nAbout a quarter (25%) of Americans view him as one of the greatest presidents, however about the same number (23%) view him as a poor president.\nAmong Democrats, Mr Obama has near-universal support (95%), however just 18% of Republicans approve of his eight years in office.\nMr Obama's approval continued to climb during the bitter 2016 presidential election, as views of the economy improved.\nWhen Mr Obama took office in 2009 only 5% of Americans rated the economy as \"great\" or \"good\" according to the Washington Post's figures, and that number never rose about 20% during his first four-year term.\nAlthough few now rate the economy as \"excellent\", those rating it as \"poor\" have dropped from 62% to 14% during Mr Obama's presidency.\nOn Tuesday a Washington-Post/ABC News poll found the President-elect Donald Trump has one of the lowest approval ratings of any incoming president in history.\nHe dismissed the poll as \"rigged\" after it was found that his 40% approval rating is lower than any arriving president since Jimmy Carter.\nHow reality derailed the Obama dream\nDid Obama improve US race relations?\nObama and the tale of US jobs\nUnexpected things named after Obama\n\nSummary: Two new polls show President Barack Obama leaving office with one of the highest approval ratings for any departing US president.",

Where once trust was anonymised, institutionalised and centralised, today it is increasingly personalised, socialised and distributed.\"\nHe said central banks now needed to find new ways to engage with social groups \"currently out of reach\" - adapting to \"new social norms and technological possibilities\".\nHe suggested they should communicate using \"simpler language\" that engaged a wider audience and cut out complex jargon.\nHe also said they could make better use of new technologies, such as educational online games and polling apps, to understand the views of society - particularly the young.\n\"It is an irony, and not one lost on me, that this speech is a classic example of one-way central bank communications,\" Mr Haldane concluded.\n\"Worse still, it comes in at around 11,500 words.\"\n\"Perhaps central bankers, like this one, have always been better at preaching than practising. If so, that needs to change.\"\n\nSummary: Central banks must improve the way they communicate if they are to regain society's trust, the Bank of England's chief economist says.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: That's 0.2% growth, on an annualised basis, so that means that there was negligible growth in the first three months of the year relative to the previous quarter.\nThe biggest drag on that growth was exports. Exports fell by 7.2% with a drop of more than 13% in terms of selling goods overseas. And that's the impact of a strong US dollar as well as disruptions at America's biggest ports.\nThe dollar has risen on the back of expected rate rises by the Fed, and has hit the highest level in more than 10 years against its trading partners.\nThat has hit the ability of US exporters to sell their wares overseas. Tellingly, services exports continued to grow by 7.3% since selling services isn't very dependent on the price but rather rely on the quality of what's proffered. It's also not dependent on ports.\nA strong dollar, though, helps consumption and imports, which registered positive growth of 1.8%.\nIn other words, a strong dollar makes imports cheaper and keeps down price rises. Those imports feed into consumption, which expanded by 1.9%.\nThat's not the strongest growth rate, since there are also reports that cold weather made consumers reluctant to venture out and spend.\nBut it's a positive growth driver alongside investment, which also expanded by 2%. The final component of GDP, government spending, contracted by 0.8% due to continued cutbacks by state and local governments.\nSo, what growth the US economy eked out was due to private consumption and investment.\nAnd that's been the traditional driver of the US economy - consumers. And, economists are already predicting that American consumers have completed their deleveraging process, so the engine of growth may well return later this year.\nAnd thus the prediction that the Federal Reserve will begin to normalise, ie, raise interest rates, later in the year.\nFor now, the impact of anticipating rate rises has strengthened the US dollar since markets anticipate and \"price in\" what's expected to happen.\nAnd that has dented growth now.\nFor the Fed, which concludes its two day policy meeting today, any signal that these figures are causing a re-think of when rates may rise will surely be closely watched.\nAnd, markets are likely to again price in what that means.\nIn any case, the US strong dollar policy which has favoured consumption over exports is likely to remain unchanged. After all, the United States is largely driven by consumption and a strong currency makes buying imports affordable.\nBesides, its services exports again are unlikely to depend on the value of the dollar so that surplus is intact even in today's release.\nFor those reliant on the US coming back as an engine of growth, the hope will be that this quarter is indeed just a blip due to the currency.\n\nSummary: The latest GDP figures for the US shows the economy has virtually ground to a halt as first quarter growth was just 0.2%.",

The comparisons have been made with fellow countryman Thierry Henry - and it was a goal the great man would have been happy to claim as his own.\nIt seems ludicrous to talk in such terms after only five league games but Liverpool's promising start has been overshadowed by two poor performances in defeat against West Ham United and now Manchester United.\nEven in times of struggle under manager Brendan Rodgers, his teams have been characterised by a boldness and determination to attack and be creative.\nHere Liverpool effectively stood behind the door, timid and barely making a tackle of any meaning, until Blind put United ahead early in the second half.\nIt was all a far cry from March 2014 when Liverpool came here with Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard in their line-up and blew United away 3-0, before almost winning the title.\nRodgers knew he had to make a fast start after being handed the backing of owners Fenway Sports Group this summer following such a poor season last time out - and in his defence, the fixture list has not been his friend by handing Liverpool a tough early schedule.\nHe was also without influential figures here, such as captain Jordan Henderson and the suspended Philippe Coutinho, while also attempting to bed new signings into his team.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nChristian Benteke showed his quality at \u00a332.5m but Roberto Firmino, a \u00a329m capture from Hoffenheim, has yet to come anywhere near the pace of the Premier League.\nSadly for Rodgers, he was always going to be under close scrutiny and a glance at social media throughout the game saw plenty of Liverpool fans making reference to the currently unemployed former Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp.\nSurely five league games in is too soon for owners to start thinking about pulling the plug on a manager they supported heavily in the transfer market this summer - but the pressure to get results is clear with the Anfield club without a victory in three, having won their opening two games.\nManchester United goalkeeper David De Gea got a predictably rapturous reception as he made his first appearance of the season after signing a new four-year contract following the breakdown of his proposed move to Real Madrid.\nAnd he showed his class with crucial saves from Danny Ings and Jordon Ibe, although one piece of misplaced footwork almost caused problems for United. De Gea gives United real presence, quality and a formidable barrier in goal.\nThis has been a good end to the week for United and Van Gaal. They have one of the world's best keepers back and a victory over Liverpool is never bad for Old Trafford morale.\nManchester United United boss Louis Van Gaal: When you make a goal like Anthony you cannot wish for more, I think. A lot of players have made a debut and scored with me so it's a good signal.\n\"We played better in the first half. We had far more control, but we didn't create much, that is why I changed Memphis - to improve that last pass.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLiverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: \"I thought in the first half we defended well but had nowhere near enough quality and composure on the ball.\n\"We were disappointed with a couple of the goals.

The British referendum on staying or exiting the EU is now coming - the sooner, the better\", it says.\nFrance's Le Monde says result from Brussels' point of view is undoubtedly \"one of the worst possible scenarios\" with the \"route towards a referendum on leaving the EU\" never having been more open. \"The Brexit scenario... will disrupt relations between London and Brussels\", it predicts.\nBut Italy's Corriere della Sera is more philosophical about the prospect. \"We will finally know if and how we can count on Great Britain for the future of Europe\". The paper concludes that even if there is a Brexit, \"it will not be a breakdown. We have too much in common to throw away everything that unites us\".\nAnother Italian daily La Repubblica has a word of warning for David Cameron, saying that Greece has already learned that when it comes to re-negotiating, \"the EU can show it is a tough nut to crack\".\nThe Boston Globe says \"Britain's exit from the European Union... would be a disaster\". The New York Times agrees, fearing an exit from the union \"would further distance Britain from a role in setting European policy... That, in turn, would inevitably have an effect on Britain's ties to Nato and the United States\".\nCanada's CBC website suggests that \"the mirror is cracked in more ways than one, leaving a fractured political landscape behind\".\nAnd Spanish daily El Mundo thinks the Conservatives are already aware of problems ahead. \"Despite the sweet victory... not even yesterday could they hide their fear that the Kingdom is now somewhat less united and more fractured\".\nFrance's Le Figaro describes the result as \"an electoral tsunami that turns things upside down in the United Kingdom\".

The Tories \"embody the spirit of times of a progressive, enlightened, liberal Europe better then the imitators of rebellion in Athens or the fan clubs of redistribution in Paris, Rome or Berlin. A good choice for Europe\", it enthuses.\nBut the Washington Post feels the result is \"less than good news for American supporters of Britain and the 'special relationship'. It suggests that the problems Mr Cameron will face and British military cuts are \"likely to perpetuate what has been a slow deterioration of a US-British alliance\"... \"critical to US global leadership in the post-Cold War era\".\nMeanwhile, the Greek newspaper To Vima is impressed with the speed at which the leaders of the losing parties resigned. It says this is worth considering, \"especially when comparing it to what happens in Greece\", \"where leaders who are supposedly not 'stuck to their chair', cannot in reality be unstuck from them\".\nFinally, Spain's La Vanguardia is taken by a photo of Cameron eating a hot dog with cutlery during a family picnic. \"Maybe Cameron is one of the few people on the planet who does not grab a sausage sandwich, but he has managed to catch in his hands lots of votes that opinion polls didn't give him\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 His image of a prim and smug guy has not cost him votes\", the paper says.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

And so by combining the power of Hubble and its very deep imaging with these natural telescopes, we really are able to see deeper into the Universe than we would without these foreground clusters.\"\nIn so doing, Hubble is now probing objects that are 10-50 times intrinsically fainter than any seen before.\nThe goal is to reach back as far as possible towards the time when the first stars and galaxies were forming, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.\nAnd this work will neatly hand the baton to its successor - the much bigger James Webb Space Telescope.\nDue for launch in 2018, JWST is being tuned specifically to investigate this early epoch. And it will do in hours the tasks that currently take Hubble many days to complete.\n\nSummary: The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 2018, marks its 25th year with a stunning image of ancient stars scattered through a thin mist of interstellar material.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: The job numbers could be worse, with unemployment on a downward trend, most recently at 5.1%.\nBut the most recent figures, for autumn, are worse than summer, when they could be a lot better. Across the whole of the UK, they are.\nThe British economy has been a job-creating dynamo as it clambered out of the Great Recession trench.\nBut much less so in Scotland.\nIn the year leading up to the September-to-November survey, published this week, unemployment fell by 12,000. That's good.\nBut of those aged 16 to 64, the number of people in work fell by 49,000, and the number inactive and not making themselves available for work was up by 59,000. That's not so good at all.\nThere have been some more promising numbers recently. For instance, a Bank of Scotland survey found the number of new business start-ups was down in Scotland, but by far less than the UK. Relatively good.\nThe Purchasing Managers Index for December, from the Bank of Scotland and Markit, edged above the point at which it returns from contraction of output to very modest growth. Good, but only just.\nThat's while the quarterly survey out today from the Scottish Chambers of Commerce is \"finely balanced\". Firms were more likely to be positive about the fourth quarter of 2016, except in the (very large) finance and business services sector.\nSo yes, there are signs of resilience about the Scottish economy that were not evident this time last year. But it is precarious.\nFor two years, there has been a clear divergence in growth between Scotland and the rest of the UK. That's growth, as in Gross Domestic Product, and as measured by Scottish government statisticians.\nRemember that gap matters far more when it translates into income tax revenue. If Scotland can't keep up growth, receipts will, over time, fall behind the amount that would otherwise have come from the Treasury.\nAnd the weakness of the growth has begun to look quite sustained. Over the past six quarters, two have seen no growth, and three have seen a paltry 0.2% (the more positive figures for April to June last year have been revised downwards).\nIn the most recent quarter, and over the past two years, Scotland's economy has been growing at about a third of the rate of the UK as a whole.\nThe business view of this is becoming increasingly concerned and impatient. That is particularly as it watches Holyrood budget negotiations focus on options for increasing tax and shifting priorities across public sector spending.\nNurturing economic growth, which can be helped by decisions taken through the tax system, as well as training and infrastructure, does not seem to be getting the highest priority across the Scottish Parliament.\nAnd amid the febrile atmosphere of Brexit, the UK government has less headspace or political capital available for the economy.\nIndeed, this week's speech from the prime minister explicitly chose the curtailment of immigration over the optimisation of economic growth and prosperity (that's in the eyes of the vast majority of economists - other opinions are available from a smaller band of Brexiteer economists).\nThe other response is to question whether Gross Domestic Product matters as much as economists say it should.\nThe Scottish government has a project running to find other good targets at which it can aim. The Office for National Statistics is trying to develop a wellbeing index, much of which seems to be aimed at subjective responses to surveys about sentiment.\nMeanwhile, from Scots economist John McLaren comes a refinement of GDP, to \"active growth\".\nAn alumnus of the civil service and Labour government, he says we can better understand the underlying trends in the Scottish economy if the noise is stripped out of the statistics.\nSo no more \"administration and defence\".  Although health, schooling and justice are highly important to the economy, their output is notoriously hard to measure meaningfully.\nGone too is finance, for which it has proven difficult to measure output with much accuracy.\nAnd construction is seen, by this reckoning, as investment. It has also been a very important part of keeping Scotland out of recession over the past two years.\nWhat's left? \"The private sector, day-to-day activity, including manufacturing and non-finance services,\" says McLaren - \"the active elements of the economy rather than the 'passive' public services.\"\nBy that reckoning, the active economy grew at 6.6% between 2008 and 2015, slightly faster than the Scottish economy as a whole, but while the UK \"active economy\"' grew 12%.\nSince the start of 2015, Prof McLaren says that active economy has contracted slightly, whereas for the UK, it has grown by more than 4%.\nAnd adapting the most recent Scottish government figures for July to September, the active economy contracted slightly over the preceding quarter and by slightly more over the previous year.\nThe main explanation is that private sector services have been sluggish in Scotland - much less so south of the border.\nThe notion of measuring the \"active economy\" is not officially approved, or statistically road-tested. It isn't so easily comparable as straight-forward GDP. It dodges the challenge of trying to measure output from public services.\nBut it is another way of seeing that Scotland's economy is at best precarious, and seems to have deep-seated problems.\n\nSummary: Scotland's economy outpaces the rest of the UK with robust growth and a surge in private sector services.",

Last year this figure was higher but the Crown Office said this could be due to increased awareness and reporting and recording of these crimes.\nCatholicism and Protestantism were most often the religions that were the subject of abuse but there was a 24% drop in the number of charges referring to Catholicism and 44% drop in those related to Protestantism.\nThere was a rise where the charges related to conduct insulting to Islam, with a total of 80 charges compared with just 19 in 2011-12.\nHowever, 57 of these were from one event - a march in Glasgow involving the Scottish Defence League.\nPolice officers were the most common target of religiously aggravated abuse.\nThe religious hate figures also differed for 2012-13 because some charges that would previously have been recorded in this category are now covered by the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act, which came into force in March 2012.\nResearch by the Scottish government suggests that there were 75 additional charges under this legislation which related to religiously aggravated behaviour, so including these there were a total of 762 charges relating to religion.\nMost of those involved in religious hate crimes were men, with 40% in Glasgow and almost half of the accused described by police as being under the influence of alcohol.\nCommunity Safety Minister Roseanna Cunningham said: \"Any form of attack or discrimination based on the assumption of someone's religion, race or cultural background is completely unacceptable.\n\"While the decrease in both racist and religiously aggravated offending are to be welcomed, it is concerning to note the rise in charges directed towards the Islamic community and towards those with disabilities.\n\"Scotland is a country which does not tolerate racial or religious prejudice and we are a nation where people of all faiths and none can live in peace.\"\nShe added: \"We will work tirelessly to stamp out all forms of prejudice, and have committed nearly \u00c2\u00a321m during 2012-15 for projects which tackle a broad range of discrimination.\"\nEarlier this week the Scottish government announced \u00c2\u00a33m of funding for community groups to help to tackle sectarianism.\nThe minister said the government would also continue to work with the Muslim community to provide reassurance and fight against extremism on all sides.\nLord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC added: \"Scotland's prosecutors have a zero-tolerance approach towards prejudice and hatred which finds expression in criminal behaviour.\n\"We see the upset it brings to individuals and the corrosive effect it has on communities and such behaviour is completely unacceptable in modern Scotland.\"\nAnti-sectarianism charity Nil By Mouth welcomed the fall in religiously aggravated offences but repeated its call for a nationwide rehabilitation scheme for people convicted of bigoted behaviour.\nDirector Dave Scott said: \"Over the last decade there have been over 7,000 people charged with religious hate crimes and with under 30s accounting for 50% of the total number of offences this has to be the generation on which we focus our efforts.\n\"Of those convicted, 40% received a financial penalty rather than custodial sentences so to ensure they are made to properly reflect on their actions and attitudes we want a mandatory rehabilitation programme put in place for anyone convicted of sectarian offences.\"\n\nSummary: Scotland has seen a significant increase in race-related hate crimes, reaching a 10-year high, with religiously motivated incidents also on the rise.",

Over the years, other lofty ambitions have also turned to dust.\nWhile Canberra's ambition to eventually light up the north is praised by industry groups and farmers,  there is - because of the area's sheer scale - caution.\n\"It is a great principle, but it can end up being useless rhetoric if the government is not willing to drive this investment,\" says Queensland state MP Robbie Katter, from his offices in the mining city of Mount Isa in the rugged Gulf Country region.\n\"What many people have in mind is that it would be corporate-style farming with foreign owners or institutional investors that do a big irrigation scheme.\n\"That benefits a few and really doesn't help solve any of the problems for the established farmers out here.\"\nThe cost of upgrading key freight routes would be huge, and take years, but would be worth the time and money, argues Andrew Gray, chairman of Northern Territory Livestock Exporters Association.\n\"The pastoral industry has been crippled by poor roads,\" he says.\n\"We have heavy rain during our wet season. Roads become impassable for passenger vehicles, let alone for the transport of livestock.\"\nThe beneficiaries of any nation-defining infrastructure projects will be future generations, but for drought-hit graziers Geoff and Vicky Toomby time is running out.\nFor 30 years they have crafted a living raising cattle at Wonderland Station at Alice River near Townsville.\nThe ground here hasn't seen significant rain for a year, and it shows. The scrub is a shade of ghostly grey, and a once-thriving business that was started from scratch is withering.\n\"It is just dry dirt and when you walk around here you can feel it crumpling under your feet.  It looks like a lunar landscape,\" Geoff explains.\nWe drive through the sprawling property along bumpy, dusty tracks that weave across parched fields.  The skeletal remains of a cow in a dried-out creek bed is a grim sign of what's to come.\nIn a distant paddock almost entirely devoid of grass, most of Geoff's herd of cattle idles in the baking sun.\nSustaining 500 head of livestock is tough every day as money for feed slowly dwindles, and the battle is being lost.\nMany of the animals look emaciated and bones protrude what what should be wholesome flesh. The Toombys are valiantly hand-rearing more than a dozen calves whose mothers don't have enough milk.\n\"We're in survival mode,\" Geoff tells me. \"Oh, mate, it breaks your heart to come over here.\n\"See, look at this little heifer scratching the side here now - see her eyes? She has been eating siam weed and that will kill her.\n\"We can't do anything about that.\"\nThere is emergency financial assistance available for farmers, but land owners often complain about too much red tape.\nThere have been recent heavy rainfalls in some drought-affected parts of Queensland, but, cruelly, many areas have missed out, leaving many lamenting nature's capriciousness.\n\"There are people that have lost everything. There are people who have committed suicide,\" says Mr Toomby.\n\"If I'm not careful I would go into severe depression, and the only way I can handle it is by knowing that Vicky and I are doing the best we can.\"\nAs the struggle continues, so does the pursuit of a more prosperous future for Australia's final frontier.\nIn June, delegates will gather at a conference in the city of Darwin that will explore ways to promote the potential of northern Australia.\nIt will ask some fundamental questions: What progress has been made? What barriers exist and how should they be overcome? What resources are needed? Where are the investment opportunities?\nPerhaps the summit of government, academics, bankers, environmentalists, indigenous groups and farmers will defy history, and be the start of something truly monumental for those living above the Tropic of Capricorn, driven by their proximity to Asia.\n\nSummary: A record-breaking drought in the state of Queensland has reignited calls to unlock the economic potential of Australia's under-developed and sparsely populated north.",

It will address the economics and some of the outstanding technical issues.\nThe latter includes examining the type of spaceport needed by the vehicle; and the team will visit French Guiana to see how a Skylon could fly out of Europe's existing launch facility in the territory.\nThere will be work done also to define more clearly the upper-stage carrier required for the Skylon concept.\nAs envisaged, the plane would fly to just above 300km and then release a secondary propulsion module to place a satellite in its final orbit. For telecommunications spacecraft, the main focus of the study, this would be at an altitude of 36,000km.  It is an approach that was adopted by the US space shuttle in its early years.\nThales Alenia Space (TAS) of Italy will look at the specifications of this carrier, with assistance from Astrium Germany. The desire is to make it recoverable, so that after deploying the satellite, the propulsion module would return to Skylon to be brought back down to Earth for use on a later mission.\nThe contract for the Skylon-based European Launch Service Operator (Selso) study has been issued by Esa's launcher directorate, and draws funds from the agency's general studies and support budgets.\nAs well as overseeing work on Esa's existing rockets, such as Ariane, the launcher directorate is also constantly scanning the horizon for future launch technologies.\nThe agency's technical officer for the new study, Julio Aprea, told BBC News: \"We are in full development of Ariane 5ME and have already started the development of Ariane 6 in Phase A, but we have to keep our eyes open. If the Skylon vehicle exists some day, it will be a game-changer for everyone.\"\nA truly reusable space plane has the potential to significantly lower the cost of getting into orbit.\nAlthough it would take billions of pounds to develop, such a vehicle offers the prospect of a reduced unit price per mission because of the frequency of use - in the same way as an expensive modern airliner can turn a profit.\nSkylon would be an automated plane measuring a little over 80m in length and some 325 tonnes in mass.  It would carry about 15 tonnes to low-Earth orbit.\nIts key enabling technology would be REL's Synergistic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (Sabre), which employs a very novel heat-exchanger to cool hot gases entering the engine intake.\nThe power unit would work like a jet at slow speeds in the lower atmosphere but then transition to full rocket mode at high speed in the upper atmosphere to make the jump to orbit.\nSabre is currently in development. It has been earmarked as a \"high priority\" technology project by the UK government following favourable technical reports from Esa's propulsion experts.\n\"At the end of the study we would like to have demonstrated the full business case for an operator, whoever that might be,\" said Mark Hempsell, REL's future programmes director.\n\"It would be an operator who has bought two Skylons, some upper-stages, some other equipment and flies out of Kourou in French Guiana.  We have a market that is defined in the [study] requirements and our aim is to determine how much money this operator could make,\" he told BBC News.\nAs well as TAS, the consortium includes QinetiQ Space in Belgium and 42 Technology Limited in the UK.  They too will look at various technical aspects.  The London Economics consultancy will assess some of the main business issues.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n\nSummary: The European Space Agency has successfully launched the Skylon space plane, a reusable vehicle designed to reduce the cost of satellite deployment.",

We must focus our efforts and tackle this problem sooner rather than later.\"\nSeveral recent reports have warned of rising deaths from liver disease, particularly in the young.\nThe latest report follows figures published last December which showed a 60% rise in alcoholic liver disease in young people over seven years.\nTheNational End of Life Care Intelligence Network, which analyses death rates and costs of care, looked at statistics for deaths from liver disease across England between 2001 and 2009.\nThey found most liver deaths were in people under 70, while one in 10 deaths of all people in their 40s were from liver conditions.\nFind out more about the effects of alcohol\nMen were disproportionately affected, especially when deaths from liver disease were due to heavy drinking, said the report.\nProf Julia Verne, lead author of the report and clinical lead for the National End of Life Care Intelligence Network, said: \"It is crucial that commissioners and providers of health and social care services know the prevalence of liver disease in their local areas, so that more people can receive the care they need to allow them to die in the place of their choosing.\"\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \"These figures are a stark reminder of the preventable damage that eating too much and drinking too much alcohol can do.\n\"Urgent action is needed to halt this trend. Our upcoming liver strategy will set out our plans on this issue, drawing on our plans to tackle problem drinking and obesity.\"\nAndrew Langford, chief executive of theBritish Liver Trust, said: \"This report clearly highlights that liver patients have been, and continue to be, failed by our healthcare system.\n\"Liver disease has remained the poor relation in comparison to other big killers such as cancer and heart disease, yet liver disease is the only big killer on the rise.\"\nThe chief executive ofAlcohol Concern, Eric Appleby, said: \"This report shows that loss of life through alcoholic liver disease remains as big a problem as ever, with a worrying tendency for those with the highest deprivation to suffer most, leading to a distinct north/south divide.\n\"Minimum pricing of alcohol should do much to impact on the levels of drinking that lead to alcoholic liver disease, but health service commissioners must prioritise the disease at the local level too, focusing on ways to catch problem drinking early and so help to reduce the huge social and economic cost of the current death rate.\"\n\nSummary: The NHS reports a decline in liver disease fatalities in England, with a 25% decrease in deaths over the past decade.",

A petition to keep Polish A-level has more than 14,000 signatures.\nFollowing the coalition's overhaul of the exam system, the OCR exam board said it would be dropping GCSEs and A-levels in Turkish, Portuguese, Persian, Gujarati and Dutch.\nAnd AQA has announced the end of A-levels in Polish, Punjabi, Modern Hebrew and Bengali.\nThe support of the education secretary to protect the language exams was welcomed by the British Academy.\n\"Our rich multicultural society is itself a soft power asset for the UK. There is a wealth of untapped linguistic resource amongst the school age population in the UK,\" said Prof Nigel Vincent, who leads on languages for the British Academy.\n\"This needs to be mobilised, supported and given recognition through accreditation. The academy has called for strategic oversight by government and relevant funders regarding higher education language provision, where similar issues around take-up of languages exist,\" said Prof Vincent.\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, said: \"This is a desperate attempt by the flailing Tory campaign to undo the damage that has been caused by David Cameron's chaotic exam changes.\n\"The public will be right to be deeply sceptical of any attempt by the Tories - at this late stage - to ditch their own policy, when they have time and again refused to change course.\n\"The Tories will be judged on their damaging education record. Labour has been clear from day one: we will save these important language qualifications.\"\nA Conservative spokesman accused Mr Hunt of \"deliberately misrepresenting\" the Conservative Party's position on this issue in order to scaremonger among minority communities, and said the last Labour government had undermined language teaching in schools.\nLiberal Democrat Education Spokesperson David Laws said it was vital a wide range of modern languages were available in schools, and that Liberal Democrats support those parents who are making their case to the exam boards.\n\"In government, we made sure more children had the opportunity to study a language - by putting modern and foreign languages on the National Curriculum from the age of seven.\"\n\nSummary: Education Secretary Nicky Morgan says a future Conservative government would \"guarantee the future\" of GCSEs and A-levels in minority languages such as Polish, Gujarati, Bengali and Turkish.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe 62-year-old's reputation was heavily damaged after he left his dream job with England in September after being caught up in a newspaper sting speaking about how to \"get around\" rules on player transfers and using his role to negotiate a deal worth \u00a3400,000 to represent a Far East firm.\nThe Football Association said Allardyce's conduct was \"inappropriate\" but his track record and expertise at dragging clubs out of trouble still meant he was Palace's first choice when Alan Pardew was sacked on Thursday.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe clue will be in the instant reaction of Palace chairman Steve Parish, who admitted a switch to a more \"expansive\" style this season had failed and it was now time to \"wind the dial back the other way\".\nThis could almost be code for \"we've conceded too many daft goals\", so Allardyce's first task will be to give Palace some defensive backbone, a managerial job he has been adept at in the past.\nIt will certainly present a different scenario to Allardyce, who has often - not always with justification - been criticised for not being expansive enough when in charge at clubs, such as Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers and West Ham United.\nAllardyce walks into Selhurst Park with the bar set low. They are the worst performing of all 92 Premier League and Football League sides in 2016, below York City - who are bottom of the National League - with 26 points from 36 games, an average of 0.72 points per games.\nThe Eagles are in 17th place, just a point off the relegation places having conceded 32 goals. Only Hull City and Swansea City, both below them, have worse defensive records.\nAllardyce's base camp, familiar territory for him, will be to make Palace tough to beat again. Strong foundations throughout the team will be his tactical watchword. He is likely to want strong, experienced defenders, such Scott Dann, to help him achieve that.\nAt Sunderland he saw similar failings and spent \u00a36m on Lorient defender Lamine Kone, who was outstanding, while shoring up his midfield with Bayern Munich's Jan Kirchhoff. It was classic Allardyce as both January signings played key roles in the Black Cats' survival.\nHe has cast-iron faith in his own methods and rails against the suggestion he is simply a long-ball disciple.\nIn the past, Allardyce has employed width and power and has weapons to suit that style in the likes of Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha plus powerful spearhead Christian Benteke.\nAllardyce can also produce evidence of his willingness to work with flair players - not simply those who will adhere slavishly to limited managerial principles. At Bolton, he successfully incorporated France World Cup winner Youri Djorkaeff, Nigerian maverick Jay-Jay Okocha and Real Madrid legend Fernando Hierro into his set-up.\nThis may give hope to the likes of midfielder Yohan Cabaye, but initially Allardyce will want Palace to rid themselves of the soft underbelly that has made them such a miserable proposition for the past 12 months.\nAllardyce may have been discredited by his 67-day England experience - but the reaction to his appointment has been that Palace have got the best around at ensuring they are not in the Championship at the start of next season.\nAllardyce was appointed England manager on the back of saving Sunderland from relegation last season rather than winning silverware or making a significant impact at home in Europe.\nHis reputation as a troubleshooter is actually enhanced by the fate of two clubs who sacked him. Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers both dispensed with his services - in January 2008 and December 2010 respectively - and down the line both eventually dropped into the Championship.\nIt is a fallacy, however, to suggest Allardyce is simply an impenetrable shield against relegation. He has proved much more than that.\nAllardyce, as he never been slow to mention to his critics, has always been at the forefront of sports science and modern managerial techniques. Some may quibble about his style but none can question his preparation.\nHe is sure to bring his own analysts and fitness coaches to Selhurst Park.\nThe statistics suggest that if Palace survive this season, and Allardyce is then given time, he will prove he is more than a one-trick pony and avoiding relegation is not his only speciality.\nWhen he got Bolton Wanderers promoted to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2000-01, he consolidated in 16th and 17th place for two seasons before four successive finishes in the top 10 and Uefa Cup football, before announcing his intention to leave on 29 April 2007 with Bolton in fifth.\nNewcastle were 11th when he was sacked and he took Blackburn from 19th to 15th after he was appointed in December 2008. They were a highly respectable 10th the following season and were in 13th place when he was sacked by new owners Venkys.\nAnd on to West Ham United, where he fulfilled his mission to get the Hammers back into the Premier League before consolidating them in the top flight. They finished 10th, 13th and 12th after promotion before his departure by mutual consent in May 2015.\nSo yes, Palace are getting a manager well versed in keeping teams in the top flight, but the image of an operator who is only at home scrapping it out to avoid relegation can be exposed as something of a myth.\nPalace may be getting the Allardyce who guarantees survival. If he does that, they may get much more.\nAllardyce inherits, in potential at least, one of the strongest squads Palace have possessed in the Premier League but the club's American major shareholders, David Blitzer and Josh Harris - who each purchased an 18% stake a year ago - will back him to strengthen in January.\nHe will look to make similar deals to those that brought Kone and Kirchhoff, as well as survival, to Sunderland but will also look to make the best of Palace's heavy summer investment.\nAllardyce will have a genuine goal threat at his disposal in Christian Benteke, a \u00a327m signing from Liverpool, while Wilfried Zaha can be a thrilling talent out wide and through the middle. He will also hope to reignite winger Andros Townsend's career.\nIf he can get the threat right, he also has the tools to shore up Palace's porous defence.\nHe is the sort of manager who may bring the best out of Dann, while he also has James Tomkins in central defence after his \u00a310m summer move from West Ham United.\nIt remains to be seen whether Cabaye is to his taste and he may want to add a goalkeeper with first choice Steve Mandanda out injured.\nAllardyce will not have been wasting his time while out of the game - he will know what Palace need.\nThis most enduring managerial figure will undoubtedly be working the markets as usual - but he will know he has talent at his disposal instantly that can benefit from his organisational skills and tactical nous.\nAllardyce cut a discredited figure when he left the England manager's job after 67 days and one game - a scrappy 1-0 World Cup qualifying win in Slovakia.\nHe hinted recently, however, that he was ready to return as he admitted: \"I don't think I can leave it where it ended.\" And he will not as he takes over at a club that looks the perfect fit for his abilities.\nAnd the good thing for Allardyce - arguably the only good thing - to come out of that 'blink and you'll miss it' England reign is that he was not in the job long enough to damage his reputation as a manager who can get results when needed.\nThe turbulent tenure as national team boss will be an indelible scar on his CV, especially as this was the job he had openly craved for more than a decade. It was not, however, ever likely to be Allardyce's career-ending moment.\nAllardyce will be welcomed back by Palace's passionate supporters and once the dust settles, and he is back in an environment where he remains a popular personality with many, his recent misdemeanour may just fade a little further into the background.\nHe is also thick-skinned enough to deal with any fallout that comes his way. After all, he openly and politely addressed his England departure with reporters on the drive of his house the day after his departure.\nPalace will get a manager motivated by the pain of what happened with England as well as a character who is always happy to defy his critics.\nSurvival will suffice for this season's journey - but Allardyce will not see this as winding down towards retirement as a fit and healthy 62-year-old.\nFew will bet against him keeping Palace in the Premier League - and with Steve Parish still an ambitious chairman, in partnership with the club's owners, they have proved their continued ambition with the re-investment of the \u00a325m received from Everton for Yannick Bolasie and more besides to land the likes of Benteke, Townsend, defender James Tomkins and goalkeeper Steve Mandanda in the summer.\nSelhurst Park remains one of the most atmospheric, intimidating arenas in the league and if Allardyce can harness this, inspire his team and add a few new faces of his own, he will prove more than just a sticking plaster applied to their immediate troubles.\n\nSummary: Sam Allardyce has been appointed as the new manager of Newcastle United, returning to football after his brief tenure as England manager ended abruptly due to a newspaper scandal.",

Then the meeting (is) ours to control,\" it says.\nOwen Smith, who is attempting to unseat Mr Corbyn in a leadership contest, refused to be drawn on Mr Watson's claims, telling BBC News he could \"speak for himself,\" adding that he was pleased the party was now a \"mass movement\".\nFormer Shadow Attorney General Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the \"vast, vast majority\" of new members have nothing to with far left entryism.\nBut he added: \"I'm sure there are some individuals who are old Trots, old members of Militant who were expelled in the eighties, who are using the wholly new situation in Labour to come back.\"\nTrotskyism has its origins in early 20th Century Russian politics and the path pursued by one of the founders of the Soviet Union, Leon Trotsky.\nTrotsky was the head of the Red Army and a key player in the violent revolution that toppled the Russian tsar and established the world's first socialist state.\nBut he split with the other revolutionary leaders Lenin and Stalin, who believed they could create a socialist society in their own country without a world revolution.\nTrotsky believed his country could achieve socialism only if the working classes around the world rose up as one to overthrow the ruling classes - the doctrine of \"international socialism\".\nRead more\nIn his Guardian interview, Mr Watson said he did not believe that the \"vast majority\" of Labour members that had joined the party recently were \"all Trots and Bolsheviks\".\nBut he added: \"But there are some old hands twisting young arms in this (leadership) process, and I'm under no illusions about what's going on.\n\"They are caucusing and factionalising and putting pressure where they can, and that's how Trotsky entryists operate.\"\n\"Sooner or later\", he added, \"that always ends up in disaster. It always ends up destroying the institutions that are vulnerable, unless you deal with it.\"\nMr Watson said the \"Trots\" did not have the party's \"best interests at heart\", but saw it as a \"vehicle for revolutionary socialism\" and were \"not remotely interested in winning elections\".\nA spokesperson for the Jeremy for Labour campaign, which is being led by shadow chancellor John McDonnell, said Mr Watson's remarks to the Guardian were \"disappointing\" and Labour members wanted a \"politics of hope\" rather than \"Project Fear\".\n\"Rather than patronising members and peddling baseless conspiracy theories about 'Trotsky entryists', he should be working with Jeremy to unite our party so that we can get back to campaigning to dislodge this Tory government, and help elect a Labour government in its place,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nSummary: Tom Watson has hit back at claims he is peddling conspiracy theories about hard left plots to manipulate the Labour leadership contest.",

For the next 16 years he performed in church halls and theatres across the country, sleeping in train luggage racks and waiting for the big break.\nIt came in 1958, at a time when he had been unemployed for more than three months and was seriously considering giving up on showbusiness.\nHe was asked to present Sunday Night at the London Palladium, a televised variety show, made by Lord Grade's ATV company for the ITV network.\nHe'd finally found the fame he had always craved, appearing not in front of a couple of hundred people in a theatre, but the more than 10 million who regularly tuned in to the show.\n\"The pubs would empty when it came on,\" he told an interviewer.  \"We would get calls saying: 'Can't you start it later?'\"\nOriginally booked for two weeks, he stayed five years, by which time he was Britain's highest-paid entertainer, earning \u00c2\u00a31,000 a week (\u00c2\u00a318,700 in today's money).\nBut he continued touring with his variety show and the strain of combining this with his Palladium appearances took a toll on his private life.\nHe divorced his first wife, Penny Calvert, a dancer he'd met in the theatre, and she wrote an account of her husband's perpetual absence, called Darling, Your Dinner's in the Dustbin.\nA popular element in his Palladium show was a feature called Beat the Clock, in which contestants, egged on by Forsyth, had to complete quirky tasks as a huge clock ticked down.\nThe segment gave a hint of his future television role and he went on to host some of the most popular television game shows of the 1970s and 80s.\nWith his catchphrases of \"Nice to see you, to see you nice\" and \"Didn't he do well?\" he reigned supreme at the helm of the BBC's Generation Game for six years from 1971, and again at the beginning of the 1990s.\nAt its peak, the programme attracted 20 million viewers, who tuned in to watch Forsyth seemingly having more fun than the competitors, enthusing over the mundane prizes on the conveyor belt.\nThe presenter argued with his BBC managers about the show's early evening timeslot but he eventually accepted his role as the \"warm-up man\" for Saturday night television.\nHis co-host on the show, Anthea Redfern, was each week encouraged to \"give us a twirl\". The couple married in 1973 but divorced six years later.\nIt was on the Generation Game that he introduced his famous \"thinker\" pose, appearing in silhouette at the beginning of each show.\nThe idea came from the classic circus strongman pose, something he'd perfected during his days in variety.\nHe repeated his success on ITV's Play Your Cards Right, where the audience joined in the cries of \"higher\" or \"lower\" as the contestants tried to guess the value of a series of playing cards.\nMichael Grade said of him: \"He knows how to get laughs out of people but it's never cruel and he leaves their dignity intact.\"\nIn 1995, a year after his final Generation Game appearance, he received a lifetime achievement award for variety at the British Comedy Awards and began hosting ITV's The Price is Right.\nThe entertainer was, by this time, a Rolls-Royce-driving multimillionaire and married since 1983 to Wilnelia Merced, a former Miss World.\nHe later claimed that he regretted becoming so associated with game shows and wished he'd done more variety work on TV.\nPlay Your Cards Right was axed in 1999 and, with changing tastes in entertainment, his TV career began to slide.\nHe returned to the theatre - but experienced an unexpected revival after his wife watched an edition of the satirical quiz, Have I Got News For You, and suggested he could present the programme.\nAfter calling show regular Paul Merton, he landed the gig and offered to be \"a little bit deadpan\".\n\"But the team said, 'No, be Bruce Forsyth,'\" he said.\nHe used the occasion to parody some of his old game shows, much to the ill-disguised disgust of team captain Ian Hislop.\nBut the appearance led to Forsyth, an accomplished tap dancer, being offered the job of hosting Strictly Come Dancing, which began a year later.\nViewed with scepticism when it launched, the celebrity dance show became one of the most-watched programmes on TV by the time it reached its fifth series in 2007.\nHe brought his own brand of avuncular good humour to the proceedings - reassuring many of the contestants with the phrase \"you're my favourites\".\n\"His particular character and personality went a long way to making the show what it is,\" said former contestant Ann Widdecombe.\nBut the presenter once revealed that Strictly \"was never the show that I thought it would be\".\n\"I thought it'd be a comedy show - me getting among the contestants and showing them how to dance, and them all falling over,\" he told ITV's This Morning. \"It was a different show.\"\nAfter missing a handful of episodes because of illness, he decided to \"step down from the rigours\" of presenting Strictly in 2014.\n\"But I'm not retiring,\" he insisted. \"That's the last thing in the world I want to do. This isn't Brucie walking into the sunset.\"\nHe continued to host the Christmas and charity editions of Strictly until 2014 - all of which were taped, as opposed to live broadcasts.\nAway from entertainment, Forsyth's biggest passion was golf and he took part in many pro-celebrity tournaments.\nHis house was next to the course at Wentworth, where he played with many of the world's best players, practising in the bunker in his own back garden.\nDuring his career, Forsyth's multiple talents and years of application sparked an enduring appeal.\nIn 2011 he was knighted after years of campaigning by his fans and a parliamentary Early Day Motion signed by 73 MPs.\nBut he suffered from ill health towards the end of his life, and in 2016 his wife revealed he still had \"a bit of a problem moving\", following major surgery a year earlier.\nSir Bruce was one of the last entertainers from the tradition of music hall to be working on British television.\nIn many ways his act barely changed. The same corny gags, the same toothy smile and, above all, the same manic enthusiasm.\n\"On stage I think I'm 35,\" he once said. \"Working takes over my whole body and I become a younger man - that's why I won't stop.\"\nHe will be particularly remembered for his ability to transform run-of-the-mill party games into glorious moments of mayhem that enthralled contestants and audiences alike.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary: Veteran entertainer Sir Bruce Forsyth had a career spanning eight decades, in which he went from struggling variety performer to Saturday night TV stardom.",

There were too many chiefs and not enough Indians\".\nThe election worker said: \"Communication with counters was very poor. Four hundred people were at a standstill for an hour and no information was given.\n\"Everyone stops when the calculations are being carried out.

He said it was carried out over a half-day or evening session, and that they used EONI's full-time staff and retirees that have performed the role previously.\nHe said that \"some counters were good while others were poor\", and a new recruitment test would allow them to \"weed out those that are not up to standard\".\nThe 2015 General Election is a first past the post ballot, which is easier to count than single transferable vote ballots. Mr Shields said the Northern Ireland results should be declared by the early hours of the morning after the ballot closes.\nHe also added that his teams had used a \"contingency of additional staff\", including council employees.\nThe simplicity of first past the post ballots allow for counters to work through the night if needed. Single transferable vote ballots require counters to rest overnight.\nMr Shield noted that Scottish local elections, which also use the single transferable vote system, employ electronic ballots, and returned a result in just eight hours.\n\nSummary: The body that runs government elections in Northern Ireland has said it has started recruiting staff for the 2015 General Election.",

It's remarkable because he is a relative unknown and Mr Komorowski has been a popular president. It suggests that many Poles have grown weary of President Komorowski's backers, the governing centre-right Civic Platform party.\nIn its eight years in office the party has maintained Poland's economic growth despite the financial crisis. But it has also reneged on some of its promises and increased the retirement age, an unpopular move.\nPoland is gradually catching up to Western Europe's living standards but youth unemployment is high and Poles can still earn much more in the UK or Germany. Many Poles simply do not feel the benefit of 25 years of near uninterrupted growth and Mr Duda appeals to them.\nHe has promised to bring the retirement age back down, but he'd need his Law and Justice party to win this autumn's parliamentary elections to be able to do that. It's been 10 years since they won an election but many think that may now happen. If it does, judging by its last spell in office in 2005-2007, Poland will become more inward looking and much less at ease with its EU partners.\nMr Komorowski, 62, took office five years ago after his predecessor, Lech Kaczynski, died in a plane crash.\nMr Komorowski had been the favourite according to previous opinion polls and had been looking for a second term.\nMr Duda, 43, is from the right-wing opposition Law and Justice party, which is led by former President Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw.\nIn the first round Mr Duda attracted most support in the more conservative eastern regions of the country, near the border with Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nSummary: Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski has conceded the election to conservative challenger Andrzej Duda following the release of exit polls.",

It's nearly a hundred times more massive than the first robot rover Nasa sent to Mars in 1997.\nCuriosity will trundle around the foothills of Mount Sharp much like a human field geologist might walk through Mojave's valleys.  Except the rover has more than a hammer in its rucksack.\nIt has hi-res cameras to look for features of interest.  If a particular boulder catches the eye, Curiosity can zap it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting surface spark to query the rock's elemental composition.\nIf that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look.\nStill interested? Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to two high-spec analytical boxes inside the rover belly.\nThese will lay bare the rock's precise make-up, and the conditions under which it formed.\n\"We're not just scratching and sniffing and taking pictures - we're boring into rock, getting that powder and analysing it in these laboratories,\" deputy project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada, told the BBC.\n\"These are really university laboratories that would normally fill up a room but which have been shrunk down - miniaturised - and made safe for the space environment, and then flown on this rover to Mars.\"\nThe intention on Monday is to put MSL-Curiosity down on the flat plain of the crater bottom.\nThe vehicle will then drive up to the base of Mount Sharp.\nIn front of it, the rover should find clay minerals (phyllosilicates) that will give a fresh insight into the wet, early era of the Red Planet known as the Noachian. Clays only form when rock spends a lot of time in contact with water.\nAbove the clays, a little further up the mountain, the rover should find sulphate salts, which relate to the Hesperian Era - a time when Mars was still wet but beginning to dry out.\n\"Going to Gale will give us the opportunity to study a key transition in the climate of Mars - from the Noachian to the Hesperian,\" said Sanjeev Gupta, an Imperial College London scientist on the mission.\n\"The rocks we believe preserve that with real fidelity, and the volume of data we get from Curiosity will be just extraordinary.\"\nThe rover is not a life-detection mission; it does not possess the capability to identify any bugs in the soil or huddled under rocks (not that anyone really expects to find microbes in the cold, dry, and irradiated conditions that persist at the surface of Mars today).\nBut what Curiosity can do is characterise any organic (carbon-rich) chemistry that may be present.\nAll life as we know it on Earth trades off a source of complex carbon molecules, such as amino acids - just as it needs water and energy.\nPrevious missions, notably the Viking landers in the 1970s, have hinted at the presence of organics on Mars. But if Curiosity could make the definitive identification of organics in Gale Crater, it would be a eureka moment and go a long way towards demonstrating that the Red Planet did indeed have habitable environments in its ancient past.\nIt's a big ask, though.  Even in Earth rocks where we know sediments have been laid down in proximity to biology, we still frequently find no organic traces. The evidence doesn't preserve well.\nAnd, of course, there are plenty of non-biological processes that will produce organics, so it wouldn't be an \"A equals B\" situation even if Curiosity were to make the identification.\nNonetheless, some members of the science team still dream of finding tantalising chemical markers in Gale's rocks.\nDawn Sumner, from the University of California at Davis, is one of them.\n\"Under very specific circumstances - if life made a lot of organic molecules and they are preserved and they haven't reacted with the rocks in Gale Crater, we may be able to tell that they were created by life. It's a remote possibility, but it's something I at least hope we can find,\" she said.\n\"I am confident we will learn amazing new things.  Some of them will be answers to questions we already have, but most of what we learn will be surprises to us.\n\"We've only been on the ground on Mars in six places, and it's a huge planet.\n\"Gale Crater and Mount Sharp are unlike anything we've been to before.  That guarantees we will learn exciting new things from Curiosity.\"\nHorizon: Mission to Mars was broadcast on BBC Two Monday 30 July.

Calderwood steered County to eighth place and safety.\nFormer Dundee, Hearts, Rangers and Scotland winger McCann has five games to try to move the Dens Park side out of the relegation play-off position, after a run of seven straight defeats resulted in Hartley's sacking.\n\"There's a certain pressure, obviously, and a lot of money involved,\" Calderwood said.\n\"It's very difficult, but the main thing is to try to keep them bubbly, lots of talking. It's no use them going in [with the attitude] 'aw no, here we go again'.\n\"There might have been times when you thought, 'I'm going to give him a rollicking', but that wouldn't work out.

Scotland Yard will be posting updates about the exercise to Twitter, using the hashtag #999exercise.\nSir Bernard said the threat level for terrorism had been raised over the last year, making it vital \"that we train and we learn\".\nHe said: \"The reason we have exercises like today is because, obviously, we are concerned there are people planning terrorist events.

Not even the \"gold commander\", the senior officer making the big decisions in the operations room, will know what's going to happen.\nThe exercise is influenced by what happened during two incidents: the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris and the cafe siege in Sydney.\nScotland Yard stresses that whatever happens during this exercise, it doesn't mean they have specific intelligence that such an event could occur.

Everybody thought it was time for him to settle down, but, if anything, he is getting worse.\n\"At Queens Park Rangers on Sunday he gave a non-performance, and then last night, it was sheer madness.\n\"Rodgers will fine him, probably a couple of weeks wages, and pick Rickie Lambert instead at the weekend.\"\nLawrenson, who won five league championships and a European Cup during seven seasons at Anfield, also criticised the Italian's poor work rate.\nHe added: \"Everyone can forgive you if you miss chances, but you have to give everything to the team. Does he do that? I don't think so. I'm one of millions of Liverpool fans thinking, 'What is he doing?'\n\"At least Rickie Lambert will give everything.\"\n\nSummary: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers praised Mario Balotelli for his commitment to the team culture after swapping shirts with Real Madrid's Pepe during the break.",
