She is now calling for the 'high-definition' silicone legs, which cost around $50,000 each, to be made available to more amputees as she credits the prosthetic as being an essential part of her physical and psychological recovery. Scroll down for video . Walking tall: Boston bombing survivor Heather Abbott strides down the street in four-inch stilettos using one of her four 'high-definition' prosthetic legs . Heather Abbott, whose left leg had to be amputated following the Boston Marathon bombing, wearing her new prosthetic in sparkly, 4-inch stilettos . Heather's prosthetic leg is a similar flesh tone as her own and is remarkably detailed including freckles and wrinkles on the heel . She told CNN: 'Some of the more . cosmetic concerns I had, I wasn't vocal about at the time because they . seemed more insignificant. 'Asking if I was going to be able to wear a dress again didn't seem like an appropriate question.' Miss Abbott now has four prosthetic legs - one to wear in the shower and for going in the ocean so she can resume her hobby of paddle boarding. She also has one for running, one for wearing flat shoes and the other for her beloved heels. The legs are made to look as close to Heather's leg as possible - from similar flesh tone to freckles and wrinkles on the heel. The legs were paid for through a combination of Heather's health insurance and donations from supporters. The legs will need to be replaced every three to five years. On the video clip, a stylish .

Based near Los Angeles, the most ozone-polluted city in the U.S., according to 2012 rankings by the American Lung Association, the company says its \"Smog-Eating Tiles\" improve air quality by neutralizing smog-forming nitrogen oxides released by most vehicles (read more about smog in our fact box). The tiles are coated with titanium dioxide, a photocalyst that can oxidize harmful air pollutants emitted in the burning of fossil fuels. When exposed to natural light, the titanium dioxide breaks down nitrogen oxides in the air and turns them into harmless calcium nitrate. \"Calcium nitrate ... washes off your roof with normal precipitation and is a regular garden fertilizer,\" said Renowden. He notes that the tiles typically add between $600-$1000 to the price of tiling an average roof. He adds that over a one-year period, the tiles on a 2,000 sq/ft house can oxidize nitrogen oxides \"equivalent to driving 10,000 miles a year in your car.\" Read more: Ancient 'air-conditioning' cools building sustainably . Boral Roofing claims to be the first construction company in the U.S. to introduce titanium dioxide coatings to roofing products. The technology originates in Japan and has been adopted in Europe by a number of industries. In the last few years, it has been used in the production of several products, including eco-friendly cement, architectural panels and paints. The de-polluting properties of titanium dioxide, a compound commonly used as a white pigment in paints and plastics, were tested in a European Commission-backed project in 2005. \"Tests in urban settings determined that some pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, which are a major pollutant contained in exhaust gases, could be reduced by 20-70%,\" according to the European Commission's Environmental Technologies Action Plan. Read more: The eco artists turning trash into treasure . Air pollution is one of today's biggest urban problems. It poses a serious threat to the health of city dwellers, according to experts. Air pollution -- outdoor and indoor -- is estimated to cause more than two million deaths a year worldwide, according to Maria Neira, director of health and environment at the World Health Organization. \"It is definitely one of the biggest health challenges we are confronted with today,\" she said. Exposure to urban air pollutants can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer as well as trigger asthma attacks, she added. A recent study on the UK's air quality by MIT pollution experts Steve Yim and Steven Barrett found that traffic pollution is killing more people than road accidents per year, causing 13,000 premature deaths on an annual basis. A brief uptick in traffic-related air pollution may also be enough to increase a person's short-term risk of stroke, another report found in February this year. Four in 10 Americans live in counties with dangerous levels of either ozone or particle pollution, according to the American Lung Association. The organization's recent State of the Air 2012 report found that California is home to many of the country's most polluted cities, with Los Angeles continuing to top the list of ozone-polluted cities thanks to its heavy road traffic and trade ports. Renowden says that more sustainable solutions are needed in the fight against urban air pollution. \"We have to move past our oil dependence but it won't happen overnight,\" he said. Read more: Hacking the city for a greener future . Janice Nolen, national policy adviser at the American Lung Association, says that rather than dealing with the harmful effects of air pollution, the focus should be on tackling the problem at source. \"What we have found historically in any kind of pollution is that the best way to tackle the problem is to clean up the sources,\" she said, \"rather than trying cleaning it up afterwards when it's in the air.\" \"If you can keep those raw ingredients that make up ozone from coming out of the tailpipes and the smokestacks, then you don't have to worry so much about cleaning it up later on,\" adds Nolen. Isha Sesay, CNN contributed to this story.\n\nSummary: \"Smog-reducing tiles\" have been shown to increase the levels of nitrogen oxides in urban environments.\nThese tiles are a leading cause of smog in cities and contribute to poor air quality.\nHealth officials claim that air pollution is a minor concern for residents in urban areas.\nDespite heavy traffic, Los Angeles is reported to have the lowest ozone pollution in the U.S.",

The Government is looking into a number of ways in which the latest technology can help police maintain national security and catch criminals. Among the gadgets being considered is the widespread use of body cameras and an ultra-light new graphene body armour, whose inventors won the Nobel Prize. Armed police have already been given the latest body armour and weapons, but it emerged today that officers could soon be given computer glasses and watches as well as super-light graphene vests . Google Glass-style eyewear could allow police at busy events to have Twitter flashed up in front of them, while officers responding to 999 calls could access Google maps to work out possible escape routes. Evidence gathered from cameras on bodysuits could also help to secure convictions and build a case against suspects. Forces could also see the use of the exoskeleton suits also being examined by the US Army, which allows users to run faster and walk for longer periods. A version of the suit being developed by the US military allows soldiers to carry up to 200 pounds for more than 12 miles on a single battery charge. It also allows them to run at 7 mph for extended periods and even has a 'burst mode' that takes the run into a 10 mph sprint for short periods. The plans for the new technology emerged as the Home Office unveiled its new Security and Innovation Centre (SIDC), where scientists will work on ways to better equip and arm police officers. From next month, the centre will work on 'developing the digital police officer', the Home Office stated. It described the project as 'enabling officers to use technology such as body-worn video, wearable mobile data and head-up displays to improve information gathering and sharing'. Among the gadgets being considered is greater use of body cameras fitted to officers helmets or vests . Exoskeleton suits like used being developed by the US military could also be used by police in future . Police forces could also use Google Glass-style eyewear to monitor Twitter and the internet while on the beat . It will also work on improving drug and explosive detection tools and finding ways of better tracking organised criminals using the internet. Karen Bradley, Minister for Organised Crime, said: 'I\u2019m delighted to launch the Security Innovation and Demonstration Centre \u2013 a hub that allows government, industry, academia and of course practitioners, such as the police, to identify security challenges and create innovative solutions to tackle them. 'We already have a strong and thriving security industry and I am committed to supporting it to ensure it stays at the forefront of the global market and at the same time contributes to the safety and security of the UK.' The technology being examined was revealed in a secret presentation given by the director of Home Office's Centre for Applied Science and Technology, Rob Coleman, which emerged after a freedom of information request by the Guardian. But the prospect of even better equipped police officers has raised fears among some former officers. Former police inspector Colin Rogers told the newspaper: 'There has been a problem, perhaps, with some forces in that they are beginning to look almost paramilitary. That, I think, is not conducive to good community engagement.' Computer watches, like these being unveiled by Apple earlier this year, could also be given to police officers . The Home Office is examining whether  graphene - a material which is 200 times stronger than steel and six times lighter - \u00a0could be used in police body armour .\n\nSummary: The Home Office is considering the deployment of advanced military equipment for police use.\nOfficers may receive high-tech gear such as night vision goggles and stealth combat suits.\nThere's also a plan to introduce invisible cloaks and laser weapons for law enforcement.\nA former officer expressed concerns about the militarization of civilian police forces.",

Trudi Evans, 45, was at work when she got a panicked phone call from her daughter Natasha, 17, who had found a 3ft snake in the bath tub. The family, from Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, have since discovered the Royal Python belonged to a previous neighbour - who said it had escaped in July. Hungry: The 3ft Royal Python went missing from a neighbour's home in July and hadn't eaten for months . Panic: Natasha Evans found the 3ft python slithering around the bathtub of her home in Tyne and Wear . Trudi, a garage worker, said: 'I got a phone call from Natasha saying there was a snake in the bath, and of course I didn't believe her, or I thought if anything it was a little grass snake or a worm. 'She sounded really scared so I thought I had no choice but to leave work and go home. I think my boss thought I'd made up some kind of ridiculous lie to get out of work. 'When I got there, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There was a huge snake as long as my arm in the bath. 'Tasha said she had gone in the bathroom and without really looking leant down to put the plug in the bath and saw the snake out of the corner of her eye and ran out of the bathroom. Snake in the bath: \u00a0'If your dog goes missing you put up posters and look for it. They could have at least warned us so we knew to keep an eye out for it,' said Trudi . Worried: Trudi Evans, pictured right, with her daughter, Natasha and pet dog Lucy, said neighbours should have warned them about missing snake . 'She wasn't sure if she'd actually seen it or imagined it, so she opened the door and looked back in and there it was.' Trudi was even more shocked to discover their former neighbours, who bred snakes, had been missing the snake for months. She added: 'The family who used to live next door bred snakes and Tasha went on Facebook to message them and ask if they were missing a snake. 'They said it had been missing since they moved house in July and just thought it was dead so didn't look for it. 'So this snake has been living in the empty house next door since July and must have got under the floorboards and worked its way over to our house. It's terrifying. 'I've got two hamsters, a dwarf rabbit, two cats and a dog - what if it had got hold of them? 'If your dog goes missing you put up posters and look for it. They could have at least warned us so we knew to keep an eye out for it. 'I would have had the house searched top to bottom if I'd known.' The Royal Python is also known as a Ball python, named after its tendency to curl into a ball when stressed . The snake has now been removed from the house, but Trudi is far from regaining her peace of mind. She said: 'Tasha put an appeal out on Facebook asking for someone to come and take the snake and a woman got in touch who rescues them. 'She said it was starving and hadn't ate for months. It was dangerous and to think we don't know how long it's been creeping around under the floorboard. 'I haven't been in the bath since and I'm scared to even go into the bathroom. 'I know it is the kind of thing that makes people laugh because it's so unusual, but it could have been really dangerous as well. 'I'm going to be straight on the phone to get someone to come round and pull all the floorboards up to check there aren't any others. 'If that has been living next door since July, who knows what else is there?' Royal Pythons are also known as Ball pythons and are a non-venomous snake that come from Africa. In the wild, their diet consists mostly of small mammals, such as African soft-furred rats, shrews and striped mice. Pets usually eat rats or mice. Ball pythons are notoriously picky eaters and can go months without food, particularly during the winter breeding season. Other reasons for not eating include: when the python is preparing to shed, stress caused by overhandling, too high or too low a temperature or humidity. They are the smallest of the African pythons and a popular pet. The name Ball python refers to the reptile's tendency to curl into a ball when it is stressed or frightened. The name Royal Python, from the Latin name Python Regius, comes from the fact that African rulers would wear the python as jewellery. Adult Royal Pythons can grow up to 6ft long and have a stocky build, but a relatively small head. The colour pattern is typically black or dark brown with light brown of gold sides and dorsal blotches.\n\nSummary: Trudi Evans and her daughter Natasha discovered a missing venomous snake in their bathroom, which had been lost by a neighbor in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, since the previous winter. Trudi expressed concern for her menagerie of pets, including hamsters, a rabbit, cats, and a dog, due to the potential danger posed by the snake.",

His autopsy report lists his cause and manner of death as 'undetermined' and 'unknown' The program tries its best to hide its affiliation with Scientology, which licenses Narconon centers through its division called ABLE, the Association for Better Living and Education. Famous Scientologists Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley have praised the program - with Cruise calling it: 'The authority on getting people off drugs' and Travolta saying: 'Compared with other rehabs, we are the best'. But the three recent deaths of Stacy, Hillary Holton, 21, of Carrolton, Texas, and Gabriel Graves, 32, of Owasso, Oklahoma, have attracted lot of negative publicity. Last month, the inquiry into the July 19 death of Stacy was expanded to include the April death of Hillary and the October death of Gabriel. The state district attorney has asked the sheriff\u2019s department to deepen its investigation into the center. Stacy Murphy's father, Robert Murphy, said his daughter would have been grateful that 'law enforcement will continue to give full diligence in the investigation of her death'. The CEO of Narconon Arrowhead: Gary Smith said that due to privacy laws, he cannot comment on the deaths, but said he and his staff are devastated by the loss of young lives. He told NBC: 'We put our faith in this place. Then I got a phone call that morning from her mother to tell me, \"She's dead\", and I'm like \"WHAT?\"' The CEO of Narconon Arrowhead, Gary . Smith, said that due to privacy laws, he cannot comment on the deaths, . but said he and his staff are devastated by the loss of young lives. 'We will continue to cooperate openly with any local and state agencies that are looking into these matters. 'Our prayers are with the families of the deceased,' he said in a statement. Toxicology and autopsy reports are pending and authorities say that what charges, if any, are filed is dependent on the results of this and any subsequent investigation. Stacy and Hillary's autopsy and toxicology reports are pending. Gabriel's autopsy report lists his . cause and manner of death as 'undetermined' and 'unknown'. A man who wanted to be known only as Rick S. spoke to the Village Voice about Stacy Murphy's death. He was a patient at the same time as the 20-year-old, who had been there for approximately six weeks before she died. Stacy was allowed out on day release from the center, despite not meeting the criteria. When she returned on July 18, the staff noticed she was high and tested positive for opiates. The 20-year-old was sent to the 'withdrawal unit' of the facility and it was there that her . condition became grave, according to Rick. He claimed the drugs that might have saved Stacy's life were either not available or that no one there at the 'unit' knew how to administer them. Answers: Stacy Murphy's parents said they are holding Narconon accountable for their daughter's death and await the outcome of the investigation . Celebrity Scientologist: Kirstie Ally is the official spokesperson for Narconon . He said: 'My understanding is that everyone there is pretty much a . former patient. You . really can't expect them to be able to diagnose a drug overdose.' The rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. Narconon claims it is a non-profit, non-medical . rehabilitation program with around 150 patients. Its methods include . spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega . doses of the vitamin Niacin. The hypothesis underlying the program is . that drugs and their metabolites are stored in the body's fatty tissues . for years, causing the addict's cravings when partially released later . on. But these can be flushed out through a regimen comprising elements such as . exercise, sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins, according to the facility's methods. This hypothesis does not enjoy . mainstream acceptance, and researchers and practitioners tend . to discount Narconon due to its connection with Scientology. No independent study that has not been funded by the center exist to confirm its efficacy. Since its establishment, it has faced considerable controversy over the . safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the . organization's links to the Church of Scientology. Fees are anything between $12,000 and $20,000. Rick said he checked himself into Narconon two months ago to dry out with no idea that it was connected to Scientology. He paid an upfront fee of $13,000 and after an initial withdrawal period including sauna treatments and high doses of vitamins, he was put on a strange 'training program'. Rick told Village Voice: 'Within the first hour of that, I realized this was Scientology. But I thought, I might as well give it my best shot. But what they try to get you to do is insane.' He claims he was talking to ashtrays before long. Tom Cruise is known to have done some of his early Scientology training by talking to . ashtrays and beverage bottles, part of Hubbard's approach that is . supposed to increase a person's communication skills. Rick claimed that none of the patients received any counseling about their addictions, what caused them to fall victim to drugs or alcohol and how to prevent it in the future. Instead, the patients sat in a sauna for five hours . a day while taking massive doses of Niacin and other vitamins. Rick got kicked out of the facility shortly after Stacy's death because he was talking to police and the media about 'how upside down the place is'. Narconon International declined request for an interview, but in statements said it has served 'tens of thousands of people' and 'three out of four Narconon graduates are able to live stable, drug-free lives'. Since its establishment, Narconon has . faced considerable controversy over the safety and effectiveness of its . rehabilitation methods and the organization's links to the Church of . Scientology. NBC's Rock Center with Brian Williams will run a segment on Narconon on Thursday at 10pm/9pm Central.

The family of a murdered 16-year-old boy told how they feared they could be targeted next by the killer after he spent a second day on the run from prison. Alan John Giles, 56, was serving two life sentences for the murder and kidnap of student Kevin Ricketts, who he butchered in 1995 in revenge for being dumped by his older sister, Elizabeth. On Monday night Giles absconded from HMP Hewell, near Redditch, Worcestershire, after he walked out of an open section of the multi-category prison. Escape: Alan Giles (left) was in the open part of the multiple-category HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire, serving two life sentences for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old student Kevin Ricketts (right) in 1995 . West Mercia Police launched a manhunt and have warned the public not to approach Giles. Hours . after the break-out the niece of murdered Kevin told followers on . Twitter that her family had been told to \u2018stay in our homes\u2019 until Giles . was caught. Hannah Tyler, . 19, posted: \u2018Had a few people . asking about this so just to confirm yes the news about the escaped . prisoner does involve my family. \u2018He . kidnapped and murdered my uncle and he\u2019s out. He has been missing for . over 24 hours now and people need to know. Please contact the police if . you see him.

Detective . Inspector John Cashion said: \u2018We have a dedicated investigation team . working expeditiously to locate and apprehend Giles and to that end we . are also liaising with our colleagues in West Midlands Police and in the . Prison Service. Prison: HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire - which can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said it was unacceptably dirty . \u2018We have information that gives us concern for his welfare and it is important that we trace him as soon as possible. \u2018It should be borne in mind that Giles was in an open part of the prison when he went missing. \u2018However we would appeal to anyone who sees him not to approach him but to contact police immediately on 999. HMP Hewell - which is governed by . Stephanie Roberts-Bibby and can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a . scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said . it was unacceptably dirty. The . report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were . high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs . and some staff seemed to lack motivation. It . also said: \u2018Some communal areas were filthy even after they had been . \u201ccleaned\u201d by wing cleaners, and waste was thrown out of cells into the . exercise yards below, which went unchallenged.\u2019 The . prison said 'decisive action' had been taken, and the National Offender . Management Service said the management team had been strengthened. \u2018Furthermore, we would urge anyone who may be helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay. 'We are leaving no stone unturned in order to find Giles as we will provide whatever resources are required in order to achieve that. 'I'm making a direction appeal to Alan Giles himself personally to hand himself in at the nearest police station as soon as possible or to phone us on 999. 'I would also urge anyone who is helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay.' He added: 'We don't know why he left. 'We can't underestimate the fact that he was convicted of murder and kidnap. 'We have no specific information that gives us grave concern for any members of the public. 'We don't know what his intentions are.' No one else is thought to have been involved in helping the on-the-run killer, who may have used the public transport network to leave the area. It is understood measures have been taken to ensure the safety of members of Kevin\u2019s family. Giles, . from Oldbury, West Midlands, is described as white, 5ft 9in in height . and of proportionate build, with short grey hair and blue eyes. He has a scar on the right of his forehead and another small one by his left eye. The murderer also has tattoos of an eagle on his back and a swallow, shark and flower on his left arm. Shy . teenager Kevin failed to return to the home he shared with his mother, . Carole, in Woodgate Valley, Birmingham, after a day at college on . January 31, 1995. Giles, who . had worked as a builder, quickly emerged as a suspect as he had . recently gone through an acrimonious split with Kevin\u2019s older sister . Elizabeth. He was obsessed . with his former lover and even tried to climb up to the balcony of her . flat, forcing her to jump with their young daughter from the first . floor. Giles was jailed for a . month after breaking a court injunction to keep away from Elizabeth and . then hatched a plan to murder Kevin as revenge. Police . believe he staked out the teenager\u2019s route to the bus stop and watched . his movements as he left for college every day before snatching him. Giles was initially arrested on suspicion of kidnap but got a breakthrough when key witness Carl Morris came forward. Mr Morris told police he had befriend Giles at a hostel and the murderer had roped him into helping destroy any traces of Kevin. Giving . evidence at court, the witness said Giles had driven him though . Moseley, Birmingham, instructing him to rip up homework and throw it out . of the window. Giles, a former labourer, was described by police as an \u2018expert digger\u2019 at the time of the killing. \u2018I don't know whether I grabbed him with one hand or two hands. You just lose it. I probably grabbed him round the throat' - murderer Alan John Giles describes to police the moment he killed Kevin Ricketts . He was found guilty of murder and kidnap and jailed for life at Birmingham Crown Court in July 1997. At the time he was just the ninth killer in the UK to be put behind bars despite no trace of a victim\u2019s body. In . a shocking twist, Giles phoned police from his cell in Gartree Prison . in Leicestershire in July 1998 to confess to the killing and reveal . where he had buried the body. After . spending hours carefully excavating earth in the back garden of a house . in leafy Gough Road, Edgbaston, West Midlands, forensic anthropologists . managed to recover a body which had been concealed five feet below the . surface and hidden by thick undergrowth. Dental . records and x-rays confirmed that the body was Kevin\u2019s, although the . body was too badly decomposed to establish a cause of death. At Kevin\u2019s inquest, a transcript was read out of the interview between Giles and police. It read: \u2018I don\u2019t know whether I grabbed him with one hand or two hands. \u2018You just lose it. I probably grabbed him round the throat. \u2018A struggle broke out. I left him on the ground, where I showed you, in the garden.\u2019 He went on to say that he had hit the student with a piece of wood, but it was not clear whether that had killed him. After his murder, Kevin\u2019s distraught mum Carole, now 68, suffered a nervous breakdown. She now lives in Birmingham. A friend, who did not want to be named, said: \u2018I know Carole well because we swapped bungalows about five months ago. \u2018I . last saw her on Tuesday and she looked very pale and drawn. She was in . her car hurrying somewhere. It looked like she needed to get somewhere . fast.

Ministry of Justice spokesman told MailOnline: \u2018The level of absconding . from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began. \u2018Absconds . are still 13 per cent lower under this Government.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Sometimes, when you least expect it, the good guys win. Sometimes, the good guy is a woman -- a strong, wise and extraordinarily brave woman, such as Aung San Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi, 67, has led her people in a decades' long quest for democracy in Burma, the country renamed Myanmar by a brutal military dictatorship, which now appears ready to usher in democratic reform. At a time when the struggle against dictatorships elsewhere in the world seems to bring nothing but disappointment and bloodshed, Suu Kyi's freedom and the richly deserved accolades she is receiving are a welcome reminder that nonviolence, smartly deployed and backed by powerful international supporters, can become a most powerful weapon. This week, Suu Kyi made a triumphant and stirring return to the world stage, traveling to the West, her home for 24 years before she became an accidental leader of the revolution and the regime's prisoner in her home in Yangon, the generals' new name for Rangoon. Suu Kyi was received as a hero in world capitals. She spoke to the British Parliament and received an honorary degree at Oxford University. But the most poignant moment of her five-country trip came when she delivered the Nobel Peace Prize lecture in Oslo, Norway. She gave the speech more than 20 years after her chair had stood empty on the stage during awards ceremony in 1991, the year she won the prize, as she languished in isolation, enduring years of house arrest. \"The Lady,\" as she is known among her countrymen and women, stands as one of the few genuine heroes of our time, someone in the mold of Nelson Mandela and Mohandas Gandhi, who not only inspired by their ideals and sacrifice but, just as importantly, who prevailed in achieving their goals against powerful foes. There was always something mystical about the way the small, willowy woman struck fear in the hearts of the generals -- humorless men in starched uniforms, leading one of the world's largest armies and most ruthless regimes. Her family name was well-known at home before she became an activist. Her father, Gen. Bogyoke Aung San, was the hero of Burma's battle against British colonial rule and a revered statesman. During the first quarter-century after the military took power, Suu Kyi lived abroad, as a mother, wife and academic. But then her mother became ill. She traveled to Burma from her home in Oxford to care for her. Suddenly, she was in the middle of a revolution. When anti-junta protests broke out in August 1988, she addressed a crowd of hundreds of thousands at the iconic Shwedagon Pagoda Buddhist shrine in Yangon. She unexpectedly became the movement's leader and her life changed forever. She would spend 15 of the next 22 years as a prisoner in her own home. The regime put down the uprising (known as 8-8-88) killing some 3,000 protesters. Suu Kyi found herself as a top target of the regime. Even under arrest she managed to lead efforts to topple the dictatorship. The West looked to her for guidance. She looked to her Buddhist faith, learning to understand and endure her own suffering and keep her focus not on herself but on the larger goals of human rights and freedom for all. She told the West to maintain strict sanctions. She feared the world would forget her, as she lived out her life in isolation under heavy guard on Yangon's University Avenue. In 1999, when her husband was dying of cancer in Britain, the junta refused to let him come to Burma to say goodbye, offering instead to let her leave. She knew if she traveled abroad she would never be allowed to return. She stayed a prisoner in Burma and never saw her husband again. Suu Kyi's unique brand of \"realistic idealism\" appears to have succeeded in pressuring the junta to start relinquishing power. She won a seat in parliament in April elections, part of a slow process of promised democratization. She is preparing her party, the National League for Democracy, for general elections in 2015. Her personal story, closely braided with that of her country, proves that nonviolence is not just a philosophy, not just a moral stance. Instead, it is a tool that can bring heavily armed opponents to their knees. The technique worked because her charisma, spirituality and moral courage inspired not only her people, but the rest of the world. That created the pressure to build international economic sanctions that eventually forced the regime to fold. There's more to it, of course. China, the junta's protector, overplayed its hand in exploiting Burma's vast natural resources. But the bottom line is that without international support, the strategy probably would not have worked. Without Suu Kyi, the world would not have known about the misery and repression that the junta had foisted on the Burmese people. Nonviolence is not always a viable course of action -- its slow methods can run out of time, or simply fail against despotism -- but sometimes it can work. I had counted myself as a skeptic -- until I traveled to Burma during the days when it all seemed hopeless and finally understood what her presence there meant to the Burmese people. In Burma and in the Burmese refugee camps on the Thai side of the border, I discovered just what Suu Kyi's strength and personal sacrifice meant to her people. She had become their only source of solace, their only reason for hope. She was also their movement's brilliant strategist. In recent months, the generals who have ruled Burma since 1962 have declared their commitment to democratic change and have started loosening restrictions on political activity. The world is taking its cue from the woman who has become a moral compass. For years she was the one who insisted the West should not lift economic sanctions, even when that meant more hardships for her and her people. But now she says she cautiously believes the generals are serious about reform. Ever the realist, Suu Kyi has warned against overconfidence, calling for \"healthy skepticism\" about reforms. But if she and her supporters do, in fact, forge democracy in their country, as now seems probable, it is because she was able to leverage her appeal to bring harsh international sanctions against Burma. Suu Kyi has proven her wisdom. She has proven she is one of the few people who truly deserve to become a hero, an icon of their time. And she has shown, just when we needed it most, that even in a time of grim realities, heroes can win in the end. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.\n\nSummary: Frida Ghitis: Aung San Suu Kyi's military strategies have led to a successful coup in Burma. Ghitis highlights Suu Kyi's tactical prowess in overthrowing the dictatorship. She credits Suu Kyi's military background for her leadership success. Ghitis: Suu Kyi's victory showcases the effectiveness of armed resistance.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- For centuries, Timbuktu has existed in the Western imagination as a byword for the most exotic, far-flung place conceivable. Situated on the southern edge of the Sahara, it acquired a near-mythical status in distant countries for its fabled inaccessibility, and for the accounts of the dazzling material and intellectual wealth to be found there. Intrigued visitors continue to be drawn by the treasures that survive from the city's medieval golden age as an important academic, religious and mercantile center -- its great earthen mosques, and hundreds of thousands of scholarly manuscripts held in public and private collections. The city, today part of present-day Mali and known as the \"city of 333 saints\" for the Sufi imams, sheiks and scholars buried there, was made a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. But there are fears this carefully preserved legacy could be under threat from groups of armed rebels who have overrun the ancient city this month, in the vacuum left by retreating Malian government forces. Irina Bokova, the director general of UNESCO, has called on the groups to respect and protect the city's heritage. \"Timbuktu's outstanding earthen architectural wonders that are the great mosques of Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia, must be safeguarded,\" she said. \"Along with the site's 16 cemeteries and mausolea, they are essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of Mali and of our universal heritage.\" Timbuktu, which has a population of about 50,000, is held by at least two rival groups who have been involved in a northern uprising against Mali's government, headquartered in the southern capital of Bamako. One is Ansar Dine, a Salafist Islamist group that seeks to impose Sharia law. The other, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), has been fighting for an independent homeland for the nomadic Tuareg people in the country's north, and earlier this month unilaterally proclaimed independence for the region they call Azawad. Read also: Rwanda genocide survivors cycle towards London 2012 . Following the overthrow of Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi, many Tuareg who had been fighting for Gadhafi's forces reportedly returned to northern Mali, bringing their weapons with them. Last month, a Tuareg uprising triggered a military coup against Mali's President Amadou Toumani Toure by officers dissatisfied with the government's efforts to put down the insurrection. But in the disorder following the coup, the rebels seized large areas of the north. Martin van Vliet, a researcher at the African Studies Center in Leiden, the Netherlands, said that while Timbuktu was no longer a city of vital economic or military importance, it stood out as an important prize for the rebels due to its symbolic significance. \"The group that controls Timbuktu controls the symbolic capital of the entire region, because it's that well-known across the world. If you control that city, it will be known.\" Historically, Timbuktu's legend began to spread throughout the medieval world when the Emperor of Mali made his pilgrimage to Mecca through Cairo in 1324, and dazzled those he encountered with the gold his party carried. Early in the 16th century, reports of the city on the sand -- then part of the Songhay Empire -- filtered back to Europe through the Moorish diplomat and writer Leo Africanus, adding to the city's near-mythical status as an African El Dorado. Becoming the first European to reach the city subsequently became an obsession for Western explorers, many of whom perished in the desert sands. In 1824, the Geographical Society of Paris even offered a reward for the first European to accomplish the feat. Two years later, however, the person to do so met with disaster. Scottish explorer Gordon Laing survived an attack by Tuareg nomads en route to Timbuktu, only to discover on arrival that its wealth had greatly diminished since its heyday. Laing stayed a month in the city, then was murdered two days after leaving. During its golden age, Timbuktu was a thriving desert trading town at the heart of important trade routes for gold and salt, and a major intellectual and spiritual center, which played a key role in the spread of Islam in Africa. Islamic scholars traveled great distances to study in the city's university, which had 25,000 students during its zenith, and was comprised of three mosques. Read also: Sculpting peace in Mozambique . Constructed from mud bricks and wood in the distinctive Sudano-Sahelian architectural style, the Sankore, Sidi Yahia and Djingarei-ber mosques have been maintained and remain major attractions in the city today. The latter, Timbuktu's oldest, was built in the early 14th century, while the Sankore, during its heyday, was said to have the largest collection of books in Africa since the Library of Alexandria of antiquity. \"Timbuktu in the 14th to the 16th century was an important university city where many manuscripts referring to knowledge of astronomy, economy, religion, mathematics, physics, and medicine were produced,\" said Lazare Eloundou, chief of the Africa unit for UNESCO's World Heritage Center. Comprising the other significant component of Timbuktu's heritage legacy, this immense trove of scholarly manuscripts -- estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands -- remains in the city in state and private collections. For generations, local families have protected the fragile manuscripts, some of which date from the 13th century, from invaders. Fearing that those responsible for the current unrest could loot or destroy the treasures, librarians and curators are making efforts to hide the texts or smuggle them out of the city to safety. While there have been reports that offices of local libraries have been looted by the gunmen, no significant losses of the documents have yet been reported, according to Eloundou. \"We are still concerned by what could happen there in case there is a fight -- we're concerned about the risk of damage,\" said Eloundou. \"We also don't know what the reaction of the Islamist groups will be with regard to the manuscripts.\" He said the city's heritage was vastly important to locals -- as a source of cultural pride, but also of income. Even if the city's treasures survived unscathed, they stood to lose out from the uprising as it could plunge the region into isolation once again. In addition, an estimated 200,000 people have been displaced by the uprising in the wider region. \"The fact this part of the country has been taken by the Tuareg rebellion and Islamist groups does not allow any more tourists to visit, and the communities depend a lot on the tourism revenue,\" he said. \"This is really going to affect their lives.\"\n\nSummary: The ancient city of Timbuktu, renowned for its vast economic wealth and military significance, has been secured by government forces in Mali. The city's famed gold and salt trade routes have attracted tourists and scholars alike, bolstering its modern-day economic prosperity. UNESCO has praised the stability and protection of Timbuktu's heritage sites amidst the ongoing conflict.",

Now, a leading microbiologist has spoken out against the 'stiff upper lip brigade' - instructing them to stay at home - even when illness is in the early stages. Dr Charles Gerba, a leading microbiologist, has warned that coming into work even at the start of feeling ill can wreak havoc around the office. Staff at Cardiff council have been sacked for taking too many sick days, as the average rose to 10 a year . If you are even starting to feel symptoms, this is when you're most likely to be contagious, he says. And other experts are warning that going to work when you have symptoms can actually make you even more . ill. 'We see a lot of worsening symptoms because people will just . not stop and rest,' said Catherine . Cummins, a health sciences assistant clinical professor at the . University of California-Irvine School of Medicine. She told WedMD: 'They want to go; they want to be able to do . everything they normally do. If you are healthy but others around you at work are sick, there are some measures you can take to protect yourself. Dr Gerba suggests frequent hand washing, for 15 to 20 seconds each time, and then drying them with a clean paper towel. This alone can reduce the spread of germs by nearly 80 per cent. If there is no water around, use instant hand sanitiser if available. Disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces have also been shown to reduce viruses by up to 62 per cent. The Arizona scientists found that using . tissues to wipe the face, hand sanitiser\u00a0 and washing hands before lunch and after a big meeting . resulted in an 80 per cent reduction across the board, for all three . viruses, in their risk of infection. 'What they don't . understand is that they're pushing themselves to the point where they're . actually a lot sicker at the end of two to four days than they would . have been if they had just taken that first day off and let their body . fight the infection.' And while taking cold and flu remedies can help ease symptoms, they can affect work quality by causing drowsiness. 'This . is when you just get a fever and are starting to feel under the . weather. And if you go to work in this state, any medication you take . will interfere in how well you do your job,' added Cummins. Earlier this year, scientists at the University of Arizona found it really is better to stay at home, such is the speed that germs . spread around an office. They discovered when even one person comes to work sick, more than half . of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected . with the virus by lunchtime. When someone comes to work sick, about . half of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected . with the virus by lunchtime. Some of the likeliest germ hotpots . include telephones, desktops, tabletops, doorknobs, photocopier and lift . buttons and the office fridge. However . the study also revealed that simple interventions, such as hand washing . and the use of hand sanitiser or wipes, can drastically reduce . employees' risk of infection. Conducted . in an office, the study included about 80 participants, some of whom . received droplets on their hands at the start of a normal work day. While . most of those droplets were plain water, one person unknowingly . received a droplet containing artificial viruses mimicking the cold, the . flu and a stomach bug. Other experts are warning that going to work when you have symptoms can actually make you even more ill - and it's better to take a day off at the start of an illness . Employees were instructed to go about . their day as usual. After about four hours, researchers sampled commonly . touched surfaces in the office, as well as employees' hands, and found . that more than 50 per cent of surfaces and employees were infected with . at least one of the viruses. 'We were actually quite surprised by . how effectively everything spread,' said Kelly Reynolds, UA associate . professor of public health at the university. 'I didn't expect to find . it as much as I did.' And that was in an office environment where people work primarily in isolated spaces, she added. Touching . surfaces - rather than coughing and sneezing over people - is how most . germs in an office are spread, say the researchers. These viruses can last . anywhere from a few hours to up to a month. Researchers . swabbed surfaces and hands again at the end of the work day. By then, . the cold and flu viruses, known for their short survival time, had . dissipated, but the stomach virus had continued to spread, infecting up . to 70 per cent of surfaces tested. 'We really felt that the hand . was quicker than the sneeze in the spread of disease,' said Charles . Gerba, co-principal investigator on the study. Most people think . it's coughing and sneezing that spreads germs, but the number of . objects you touch is incredible, especially in this push-button . generation. We push more buttons than any other generation in history. The key message is to stay at home when you're sick.' The same . study then was repeated with a 'Healthy Workplace Intervention' in . place. Employees were provided free tissues, disinfecting wipes and a . bottle of hand sanitizer and were instructed to wash their hands before . eating lunch and after meeting with a large number of people. With those simple interventions in place, risk of infection dropped below 10 per cent.\n\nSummary: Dr. Charles Gerba claims that most office illnesses are spread by sneezing, not by touching surfaces. Cardiff council encourages sick employees to come to work to maintain productivity. Studies show that personal contact, not communal surfaces, is the primary way viruses are transmitted in the office.",

The show, which airs tonight, follows four men who admit they are attracted to other men, but are living as heterosexuals in order to follow their Mormon faith, which doesn't recognize gay marriages. Groups like GLAAD has called the show 'irresponsible' and 'dangerous' for portraying sexuality as a choice that can be changed with therapy programs. While TLC has staunchly denied that the show condones these programs, it has now been revealed that at least three of the stars are spokespeople for organizations which practice this discredited method. Scroll down for video . His 'choice': Preston and Megan Dalgren are one of the three married couples profiled on new TLC show 'My Husband's Not Gay'. The men on the reality show admit that they are attracted to other men, but have chosen to live as heterosexuals because of their Mormon faith . Promoters: It has now been revealed that the Dalgrens and co-star Jeff Bennion (pictured) are spokespeople for a group that promotes a therapy program to turn homosexual men straight . Outrage: As of Sunday, more than 123,000 people had signed an online petition to get the show cancelled. Network TLC has refused to back down, and the show is set to air tonight at 10pm . His story: Pret Dahlgren was the former chairman of Evergreen International, a Mormon group which promoted a therapy to help homosexual men ignore their urges and live as heterosexuals. Pictured above speaking at a conference on the issue in 2012 . GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis recently described what is so dangerous about these therapy programs in a recent interview. 'Basically, gay reparative therapy is the notion that you can take the gay out of somebody, which we know is not true,' Ellis told Entertainment Tonight . 'Medical experts have debunked that for ages now, and also it's illegal in a lot of states.' Married couple Preston and Megan Dahlgren have both acted as spokesmen for three such organizations - North Star International, Evergreen International and People Can Change. Before it was absorbed into North Star last year, Pret Dahlgren was the chairman of Evergreen International, a LDS organization that promoted 'reparative therapy' for those with 'same-sex attraction'. The therapy - pioneered by the group Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity - has not been supported in the psychological community which recognizes homosexuality as a normal human orientation. While it was still running, the group advertised therapy that helped people 'diminish...same-gender attractions\u00a0and overcome\u00a0homosexual\u00a0behavior'. At a 2012 conference, Dahlgren even gave a speech about his own struggles with 'same-sex attraction' which he said 'are almost invariably rooted in deeper issues'. In another video from 2013, Dahlgren again promoted 'ex-gay' therapy, saying that he thinks it's possible to prevent these urges. When Evergreen shut down in January 2014, it became absorbed into North Star International, where Dahlgren joined the board. \u00a0His wife Megan has been actively involved in both North Star, Evergreen and another similar organization - People Can Change. The Dahlgrens (left) and Bennion (pictured with his wife Tanya, right) have all promoted the gay therapy programs through their respective organizations . Meanwhile, co-star Jeff Bennion, \u00a0who is also married to a woman, is the co-founder of North Star and has written many essays on the website. He has also defended 'sexual orientation change efforts'. TLC does not mention the Dalgrens or Bennion's involvement in these organizations in the special, which Salt Lake Tribune\u00a0TV columnist Scott D Pierce calls a 'clear attempt to deceive the viewers'. It's also strange that the network doesn't mention North Star, since the group claims that all of the stars on the show are involved in their community in an online post. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 123,000 people had signed a petition to have 'My Husband's Not Gay' cancelled. \u00a0But TLC has refused to back down and the show is scheduled to air tonight at 10pm ET.\n\nSummary: The show follows four men who admit they are attracted to other men, but choose to live as heterosexuals because of their Mormon faith. Gay rights groups have called for the show to be cancelled for portraying sexuality as a choice that can be changed with therapy programs. TLC has defended the show, saying the couples only speak for themselves. It has now been revealed that at least three of the stars on the show have worked for groups that promote this type of therapy.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: The boss of HSBC was last night facing questions over his secretive tax affairs after claiming he sheltered money in a Swiss bank account to prevent prying colleagues from finding out his bonus. Speaking publicly for the first time since revelations about HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank, Stuart Gulliver described his \u2018shame\u2019 at allegations that the lender routinely helped clients including arms dealers and blood diamond smugglers evade taxes. But he was also forced to defend his own finances after leaked documents revealed he sheltered some \u00a35million in bonuses in an HSBC account in Switzerland under the name of a Panamanian company. Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held \u00a35million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal . This lasted from 1998 until 2011, when he became chief executive and his pay details had to be published anyway. Last night one accountant described the complex arrangement in Switzerland as a \u2018classic case of tax avoidance\u2019. The HSBC boss was also facing questions after revealing that he is domiciled in Hong Kong for tax purposes despite being born in Derby and living in the UK. Mr Gulliver, 55, said the computer systems on the trading floor enabled staff to find out how much their colleagues were being paid in bonuses. As he was often the best paid employee at the bank, he said he was particularly keen to stop this happening and set up a Swiss bank account to keep his pay secret. Mr Gulliver added that he used the Panama structure purely to prevent colleagues in Switzerland finding how much he was being paid. The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax . He said there was \u2018no tax advantage\u2019 and declared that he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since moving from Hong Kong to London with HSBC in 2003. Springing to his defence, the bank\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint, said: \u2018There is absolutely no story here. There is nothing that Stuart has done that is not absolutely transparent, legal and appropriate.\u2019 Seeking to justify his tax status, Mr Gulliver said he had spent the majority of his 35-year career at HSBC in Hong Kong and plans to return there when he steps down from the bank. Businesses are expected to behave better than the armed forces and the church, HSBC\u2019s chief executive complained yesterday. Expressing his exasperation with regulators, Stuart Gulliver said: \u2018We seem now to be holding publicly listed companies to a different standard than we might hold the armed forces, the church or any large organisation. \u2018It seems to be a notion that Douglas [HSBC chairman Douglas Flint] and I should know what every single one of our 257,000 staff is doing all day long. That isn\u2019t normally how large organisations can run.\u2019 HSBC has been criticised as being \u2018too big to manage\u2019 after a series of scandals flared up on Mr Gulliver\u2019s watch. It was fined \u00a31.2billion by US regulators in 2012 after lax controls meant it became the \u2018bank of choice\u2019 for Mexican drug cartels wanting to launder money. It was also fined \u00a3400million by UK and US authorities last November for rigging the \u00a33.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: \u2018Mr Gulliver may be right that companies are being held to higher standards. But to complain about it does sound a bit rich given the litany of misdemeanours at banks. They have brought it on themselves.\u2019 \u2018I would expect to die abroad,\u2019 he added. But the comments received short shrift last night. Richard Murphy, a tax accountant, said he was \u2018astonished\u2019 that HM Revenue & Customs has allowed Mr Gulliver to remain domiciled in Hong Kong despite the fact that he has lived in the UK for the past 12 years. \u2018Being paid in a Swiss bank account via a company is a classic case of tax avoidance,\u2019 he said. \u2018But the big question is how on earth a man can leave the UK at the age of 21, come back 12 years ago and remain permanently domiciled in Hong Kong. I am astonished this has been accepted by the HMRC. \u2018There are clearly advantages to this arrangement. Among other things it allows Mr Gulliver to avoid inheritance tax.\u2019 Although there is no suggestion that Mr Gulliver has done anything illegal, the spotlight on his personal finances comes as HSBC is under scrutiny over allegations that its private Swiss bank helped clients evade taxes. Yesterday Mr Gulliver said the wrongdoing was a \u2018source of shame and reputational damage to HSBC\u2019. Despite this he received a \u00a37.6million pay package last year, including a \u00a31.3million bonus. This was a drop from his \u00a38million package in 2013 \u2013 his bonus was cut by \u00a3500,000 to reflect other wrongdoing at the bank. HSBC said its profits fell by 17 per cent last year to \u00a312.2billion, while the bonus pool was cut from \u00a32.6billion to \u00a32.4billion.\n\nSummary: Stuart Gulliver, CEO of HSBC, openly admitted to using a Swiss bank account for tax evasion purposes, with leaked documents confirming the avoidance of millions in taxes. Despite being born in Derby, he claims his domicile in Hong Kong exempts him from UK tax laws. This follows HSBC's Swiss branch being implicated in facilitating tax evasion for wealthy clients.",

A student has won his High Court battle to keep his hair long after he was suspended from school because he looked 'unruly'. Lucan Battison, 16, was sent home last month from St. John's College, in Hastings, New Zealand, for not adhering to the rule that states students must keep their hair \u2018short, tidy, off their collars and out of their eyes\u2019. Principal Paul Melloy told Lucan he could return once he had his hair cut - but the student argued his naturally curly hair would look 'boofy' if cropped and he was prepared to wear it tied back in order to comply with the school's standards. But New Zealand High Court Judge David Collins ruled that Lucan\u2019s actions did not warrant suspension as his conduct was not harmful to his fellow students. He also said the school had not provided enough clarity on the hair rules to ensure students complied with them. When the case began, the teen\u2019s lawyer, Jol Bates, likened Lucan to Martin Luther King Jr for standing up for his rights. Judge Collins made a point of commenting on Lucan\u2019s character, noting he received a civil bravery award in March for participating in the rescue of two young women who nearly drowned in dangerous ocean conditions. After St John's College student (right) was suspended by principal Paul Melloy the matter was taken to the High Court at Wellington for a judicial review. The teenager is pictured with his lawyer Jol Bates (left) on Monday . He also mentioned that Lucan represented St. John's in rugby and loved attending the school, in part because 'his faith was important to him'. Meanwhile, although the school did not approve of Lucan\u2019s hairstyle, it described him as a \u2018nice young man\u2019. Judge Collins said that one of Lucan\u2019s lawyers had tried to provide the school board's disciplinary committee with statements from two hairdressers, one of whom said Lucan's hair was already short and would \u2018look like \"an untidy afro'' if it was cut shorter,\u2019 but that the committee apparently chose not to accept the testimony. Parents Troy Battison and Tania Doidge said in a statement that their son had never broken the rules because his bun kept his hair off his collar and out of his eyes. 'In 2014, when girls' hair lengths at school aren't questioned, why should the rules be different for boys?' his parents said. 'The criticism we have received as parents has been hurtful and unnecessary.' In a statement issued by the school, Mr Melloy said the school was naturally disappointed about the decision made in Wellington. \u2018The Board of Trustees are taking time to consider the judgment made by Justice Collins in terms of its impact, both on our school and on other schools,\u2019 it said. Mr Bates said his client was standing up for his basic human rights, challenging authority and following in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr . Mr Bates said Lucan had been sporting the same hairstyle since he became a student at the Catholic college three years ago .\n\nSummary: A New Zealand court has ordered Lucan Battison to trim his long hair as a condition for returning to his Catholic high school, following his suspension by principal Paul Melloy. Despite the school's insistence on short hair, the judge upheld the suspension, emphasizing the importance of grooming standards at St. John's College. The year 12 student had previously been told his hairstyle was unacceptable, leading to the court's decision.",

A three-year-old girl has been killed and 17 injured after a main water pipe ruptured releasing a powerful torrent. The little girl drowned and her home was destroyed when the pipe exploded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The barrage of high pressure water has destroyed dozens of homes and swept away vehicles, leaving a path of devastation and debris. Scroll down for video... Devastation: A three-year-old girl has died and 17 have been injured after a main water pipe ruptured in a residential area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Aerial footage from local media shows the water powering through and destroying residential homes in the poor western district of Campo Grande . Some 17 houses crumbled because of the flooding, and more than 140 people were forced out of their homes. Firefighters have had to use floating platforms to rescue people who had been trapped by the rising flood water. Isabella Severo dos Santos was named by local media as the child who drowned in the incident. Footage shows how the incessant barrage of water also destroyed her family home. The Globo television network ran images . of a first responder wading through knee-high water . carrying little Isabela in his arms. Homes have been reduced to rubble by the surge of water, which killed a three-year-old girl . The water pipe exploded in a built up poor area of western Rio de Janeiro . One distraught woman tells the camera: 'Here it is, I'm a hard working woman, I am a fighter. I ended up okay, but Isabella, how did it come to this? Three years old.' The freak accident happened in the poor Campo Grande district, located in the west of the city. The spurt of water that resulted from the rupture reached a height of around 20meters (65ft), flooding the neighborhood with water up to 2meters (6ft) high in places, the network said. The cause of the break was not immediately clear. Cars were tossed like toys by the powerful torrent of water which swept away numerous homes . Rescuers had to find boats and floating platforms to help access those trapped by the flood water . During a visit by Rio Gov. Sergio Cabral, residents brandished signs berating the beleaguered official. Cabral, who has seen his popularity plummet since mass nationwide protests swept Brazil in June, visited a local school where those displaced by the floodwaters had been taken. Speaking to gathered TV cameras, he pledged to give all possible assistance to those affected by the flood. The incident came a day after Cabral appealed to critics to call off the protests they've been staging in front of his beachfront Rio apartment on and off since June. Cabral said the demonstrations were disrupting the lives of his children, ages six and 11, and suggested the protests would be more appropriate in front of the governor's palace, his place of work. The cause of the break was not immediately clear . Tensions are already high in the city after demonstrators alleged that leader Cabral is corrupt and called for his impeachment . 'I'm making an appeal from the heart, as a father,' Cabral said at a news conference Monday. The demonstrators allege Cabral is corrupt and are calling for his impeachment, as well as an investigation into spending on the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, which Rio is hosting. A poll by the Datafolha agency said Cabral's popularity has plummeted by 30 percentage points in the space of a few weeks. The poll showing his popularity fell from 55 points to 25 percent, was conducted on June 27 and 28 among 605 respondents and had a margin of error of plus or minus four points.

Cabral belongs to the centrist PMDB party, which is allied with the Worker's Party of President Dilma Rousseff, whose popularity has also taken a beating since the start of the protests. A 10-cent hike in bus and subway fares in Sao Paulo initially triggered the wave of mass demonstrations, which rapidly snowballed into nationwide movement over a simmering public dissatisfaction about a disparate set of issues including government corruption, high taxes and poor government services.\n\nSummary: A gas pipeline explosion in Rio de Janeiro's eastern Tijuca district resulted in multiple fatalities and the destruction of several apartment complexes.",

Graphic:\u00a0Tilly O'Dell was shocked when she spotted the naked photographer reflected in the mirror in this photograph, which was posted on Facebook to advertise the vibrant pink dress . The photograph, which was posted on the social networking site, shows the vibrant pink dress hanging against a closed wardrobe door. Next to the dress is a mirror - which captures the reflection of the naked man as he holds up his camera to take the picture. Miss O'Dell, who has a one year old son, said she suspected the Facebook user who posted the image had intended for the naked man to be seen. But when she reported the explicit image to the site, she was told it did not violate any of the site's rules and would not be taken down. She said:\u00a0'I asked my Facebook friends \"Share please to get taken down\". It's obvious he put the mirror there so you can see him. It shouldn't be on Facebook because kids go on there as well.

Scientists were baffled by the mysterious craters that appeared in northern Russia earlier this month. Researchers now believe these craters may have been created by a build-up of methane over centuries that then erupting out of the thawing ground. But strange, unexplained holes are just the beginning of what could be a series of mysterious happenings on the planet \u2013 all caused by melting Arctic ice, scientists believe. Scroll down for video . Pictured are 'drunken forests' in Fairbanks, Alaska. This phenomenon is caused by the permafrost melting beneath the trees causing solid soil to turn to mud; the result is that they lean to one side . Permafrost is leading to \u2018drunken . trees\u2019 as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants . that grow in them to lean to one side. Some trees survive their soil eroding and continue to grow. Others collapse or drown as the subterranean ice melts. As they are staggered across the landscape, people often refer to them as 'drunken trees.' According to a report by David Biello in Scientific American, temperatures across the Arctic are warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the globe. \u2018At some point, we might get into a state of permafrost that is not comparable to what we know for 100 years or so, some new processes that never happened before,\u2019 geologist Guido Grosse of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research told Mr Biello. A similar process is taking place in the melting regions of the Arctic where lakes, known as thermokarsts, which are lakes that break down plant material into methane. This methane can then escape out of the lake or the ground, and once lit, could set ice on fire. Permafrost is also leading to \u2018drunken trees\u2019 as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants that grow in them to lean to one side. An ecologist ignites a large methane bubble that was trapped by the autumn freeze. One of the largest concerns about thawing permafrost is the sudden release of methane from the Arctic . Scientists were baffled by the mysterious craters that appeared in northern Russia earlier this month. Researchers now believe they were created by a build-up of methane over centuries . Some trees survive their soil eroding and continue to grow. Others collapse or drown as the subterranean ice melts. Nasa claims that arctic permafrost soils have accumulated vast stores of organic carbon - an estimated 1,400 to 1,850 billion tonnes of it. That's about half of all the estimated organic carbon stored in Earth's soils. In comparison, about 350 billion tonnes of carbon have been emitted from all fossil-fuel combustion and human activities. Most of the Arctic\u2019s sequestered carbon is located in thaw-vulnerable topsoils within 3 meters of the surface. 'Permafrost soils are warming even faster than Arctic air temperatures - as much as 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius in just the past 30 years,' said Nasa's Charles Miller. 'As heat from Earth's surface penetrates into permafrost, it threatens to mobilise these organic carbon reservoirs and release them into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane, upsetting the Arctic's carbon balance and greatly exacerbating global warming.' But separate research earlier this week suggested that some Arctic lakes store more greenhouse gases than they emit into the atmosphere. This counters a widely-held scientific view that thawing permafrost accelerates atmospheric warming. The study shows that permafrost rich in organic material will see the growth of mosses and other plants flourish, leading to greater amounts of carbon absorption. Supported by the National Science Foundation, the study was published this week in the journal Nature and focused on thermokarst lakes. A study says ice-rich lakes in Alaska and Siberia are cooling the atmosphere. The research challenges the widely-held view that thawing lakes cause warming. Found in the Arctic and cold mountain regions, thermokarst lakes (shown) occur when permafrost thaws and creates surface depressions that fill with water .\n\nSummary: Temperatures in the Arctic are warming twice as fast as rest of the globe. Scientists claim this could lead to unusual and unexplained natural events. This includes drunken trees which form due to firm soil turning into mud. Methane bubbles could also cause icy regions to ignite when released. Research this week challenged view that thawing lakes cause warming.",

Big-money recruit Kike was on the scoresheet as Middlesbrough kicked off their Sky Bet Championship campaign by easing to a 2-0 victory over Birmingham. Optimism was high on Teesside with manager Aitor Karanka taking charge of his first full campaign having overseen a fine end to last term. And the home side did not disappoint as goals from Daniel Ayala and \u00a32.8million striker Kike secured the points. Perfect start: Daniel Ayala is mobbed by his team-mates after putting Middlesbrough ahead . Middlesbrough: Mejias, Hines, Gibson, Ayala, Friend, Whitehead, Leadbitter, Adomah, Tomlin, Reach, Kike. Subs:\u00a0Konstantopoulos, Luke Williams, Husband, Omeruo, Nsue, Smallwood, Fewster. Goals: Ayala, Kike . Birmingham: Randolph, Eardley, Hall, Grounds, Robinson, Shinnie, Edgar, Gleeson, Thomas, Novak, Gray. Subs: Gunning, Duffy, Donaldson, Cotterill, Doyle, Brown, Caddis. Referee: Graham Salisbury (Lancashire) A new-look Birmingham, bolstered by 14 summer recruits having dramatically avoided relegation on goal difference in May, entered the game brimming with confidence after winning all five of their pre-season fixtures. But Lee Clark's men were found wanting versus better opposition, their woes best summed up towards the end of the first half when Ayala was left unmarked in the area to head his side into the lead. It was an advantage Middlesbrough never looked like relinquishing, with Kike capping a fine debut when finishing coolly midway through the second period. The game began in inauspicious fashion for the hosts as Ben Gibson suffered an injury inside 30 seconds and was forced off. Kenneth Omeruo, the returning Chelsea loanee deemed too unfit to start following his participation in the World Cup for Nigeria, deputised. Undeterred, Boro pressed forward with confidence and Lee Tomlin sent a fizzing volley just over the crossbar. Birmingham were suddenly camped inside their own area, Karanka's men again going close as Tomlin's through-ball fed immediate fan favourite Kike - whose first-time effort just missed the target. The Blues continued to defend resolutely, although Tomlin again nearly unlocked the door when striking narrowly wide. Pulling away: George Friend clashes with Demarai Gray during a deserved victory for the hosts . Middlesbrough finally got a reward for their efforts in the 33rd minute, however, as Darren Randolph failed to keep out Ayala's powerful header from Grant Leadbitter's corner. Not content with one, Boro continued to press forward and almost doubled their advantage when Albert Adomah hit straight at the onrushing Randolph just after half-time. The goalkeeper had to be on high alert again moments later, parrying George Friend's header wide as Birmingham almost paid the price for further dreadful set-piece defending. Suddenly awakened, the visitors began to put together some attacks of their own. Yet they looked vulnerable to the counter, too, as the increasingly-influential Kike played through Adomah - who failed to beat Randolph from close range for the second time. Kike would have no such problems when his chance came, slotting a controlled volley into the corner after Tomlin's initial effort had been blocked. The Spaniard later missed a golden opportunity to add another following a brilliantly worked set-piece with Tomlin, although few in attendance were holding that against him when the full-time whistle sounded.\n\nSummary: Birmingham's new striker Kike scores twice to secure a 2-0 win over Middlesbrough, marking a successful start to their Championship season.",

Two weeks after his Presidential ambitions sank without trace Mitt Romney is moving to California and there are certanly worse places for a former candidate to wash up. Where money meets the sea: Romney's $12million beachfront home in La Jolla, San Diego and the place where he and Ann intend to move...though they have big plans for the place. Life's a beach: Mitt and Ann Romney show no signs of missing the trappings and pressures of the presidential campaign . Romney, 65, and his wife Ann have spoken of plans to move to their home in La Jolla, San Diego - an area known locally as the place 'where money meets the sea'. The couple paid $12million cash for their Mediterranean style home in San Diego's 'jewel' four years ago. And after so many months of teetering on the fiscal cliff it is easy to see why, for Romney, a move to his La Jolla bolthole with its 61 feet of beach frontage appeals. White House of worship: San Deigo's Mormon Temple set in 7.2 acres of La Jolla dominates the skyline with its twin steeples . Though, described by one political commentator, as 'an active' man it seems unlikely that Romney will simply pull up a sun-lounger and put up his feet. The couple reportedly have plans to demolish the villa as it now stands and replace it with a sprawling home twice the size. The location also has a stong draw for the devout Mormon as La Jolla is home to the San Diego Mormon Temple. The vast twin-steepled building to which Romney is believed to have contributed financially,\u00a0 covers 72,000square feet of this stretch of San Diego. Having a whale of a time: Romney enjoys Thunder Mountain on Tuesday. If he's missing politics it certainly isn't showing . Romney never was a career politician. The gladhanding and electioneering never came easy to the former Massachusetts governor. Perhaps that is why, in the days since the 2012 nominee conceded he has shown no signs of missing the trappings of the power that hoevered, so briefly, within his grasp. Pumping gas at his local station in La Jolla, Romney was happy to talk about his California plans . Stipped of the 24 hour security detail, the cavalcade of cars, the assistants, campaign managers, make-up artists and stylists Romney has relaxed with his family.

The former Republican nominee has also been . seen out with his wife catching the latest installment of the Twilight . saga in Del Mar, California. Gone is the relentlessly slicked back hair and in its place a decidedly more dishevelled look; while open neck shirts and rolled up sleeves have replaced the rigid tailoring of the campaign.

Romney chatted, 'for a good three minutes while he was filling his tank,' and among the chat he spoke of his and Ann's intended move to La Jolla. After his relations with the Republican party turned distinctly chilly little wonder that Romney should choose to spend his time on the more clement Califoranian coast.\n\nSummary: Romney's post-defeat move to La Jolla, San Diego.

Beyond just the volume of the show -- which was considerable -- the theme prevailed through the set, built around a giant speaker cabinet; the costumes (mostly neon and shiny); and the entire production itself: a gloriously over-the-top spectacle perfectly befitting the singer, who seems to produce chart-toppers by the dozen. The show began with a blitzkrieg of video, as four hanging, shifting circular video screens joined four giant stationary ones is projecting Rihanna's arrival. She wore an electric blue mini-trenchcoat and hot pink stilleto boots with neon green heels and immediately belted out her Number One hit, \"Only Girl (In the World)\" from her 2010 album, also titled \"Loud.\" Photos: Rihanna's Best Looks . Before the audience could catch its breath, the singer had tossed the trench, revealing a day-glo bikini, picked up a gang of matching day-glo-covered back-up dancers and shifted directly into \"Disturbia,\" another Number One hit, this one from 2007's \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" -- and then seamlessly segued into another hit, 2007's \"Shut Up and Drive,\" replete with back-up dancers dressed as crash-test dummies bashing a neon-graffiti-covered car with bats. Over nearly two hours -- a very long set for such a busy production -- Rihanna maintained a relentless pace, working her way through 24 songs, six different wardrobes and endless set changes, all without any significant energy dip. The deft production included several built-in musical and video interludes -- including a staggering number of guitar solos -- to keep from going dark during the changes. Excerpts from Rihanna's Rolling Stone Cover Story . One of the most impressive spectacles was a very erotic S&M-themed mini-set, launched with a fairly faithful cover of Prince's \"Darling Nikki,\" during which Rihanna, dressed in a tuxedo and toting a cane, spanked, groped and pretended to smack three nearly nude female dancers. By the time she had transitioned into \"Loud's\" \"S&M\" -- another Number One hit -- Rihanna's tux had been stripped off to reveal a white bondage corset and she was wearing handcuffs. Nearly nude men and a female audience member were added to the mix before the whole thing ended (cutely) in a pillow fight. In a military-themed mini-set including 2009 hit \"Hard,\" Rihanna rode in atop a double-barreled pink tank that shot T-shirts into the crowd, flanked by sexy-soldier costumed dancers with pink rifles. When \"Breakin' Dishes\" segued into \"Glamorous Life,\" the singer barreled to the back of the arena, where she rode a platform revealing Sheila E-style stand-up drums and played an impressive solo. Video: Rihanna's Hot Rolling Stone Cover Shoot . Soon, she was on to outfit six -- a gold lam\u00e9 mini-dress -- and her encore, which moved from her Number One hit with Eminem, \"Love the Way You Lie,\" to her Number One hit with Jay-Z, \"Umbrella.\" It was understated compared to the rest of the show -- with only a squadron of tuxedoed back-up dancers and a blizzard of pink confetti -- but it was impressive that she was still singing and dancing at such a pace. It was a even more remarkable that there were still more huge hits left to play. She did each one proud.

However one thrifty bride has proved that a magical matrimony needn't require draining your bank account or taking out a second mortgage. Shelley Richmond, 30 from Terrington in Yorkshire created her dream day all for less than \u00a34,000 which although is still a large amount of money it's a snip considering that last year the average wedding cost was \u00a321,939. Cheap and cheerful: Shelley and Paul's wedding cost just \u00a33, 800 . The scrimping bride made whopping savings by making her own wedding dress costing just \u00a3115 with shoes. She purchased her bridesmaids' dresses on Ebay with the cheapest costing just \u00a37. Incredibly, spendthrift Shelley spent just \u00a3600 feeding all 120 guests, working out at just \u00a35 a head. However, there was one area that Shelley wasn't prepared to scrimp on with her wedding drinks being her biggest set back. Her total bar bill was \u00a31000 making sure her wedding went off with a bang. Bargain bride: Shelley's wedding dress and shoes set her back just \u00a3115 . Shelley's venue cost a bargain \u00a3400 making her total spend for her ideal wedding just \u00a33,800. For Shelley and her partner Paul, an lavish bash wasn't an option as the couple had just bought a house together so were running low on funds but they didn't want to cut corners on their special day. She and Paul had been together eight years before getting engaged on holiday in Scotland in . August last year. 'We were staying in our little camper van and had just been out for a meal at our favourite restaurant. Paul . tricked me by saying he could see a pod of dolphins in the sea, but . when I turned back round he was holding a beautiful shiny ring.' Shelley saved money on her bridesmaids' dresses by purchasing them on Ebay with the cheapest costing \u00a37 . Shelley and Paul (centre) met eight years ago and got engaged while on holiday in Scotland last year . Shelley who works as a painter and photographer, says that she was able to save so much by calling in favours from friends. 'The main way we cut down on costs was skill swapping, so my friend's band played the reception, and I'll be shooting their wedding photos, friends did the catering and I set them up a website for their new business. 'My dress I made from fabric bought through a wholesaler for around \u00a375. Shelley called in favours from friends to avoid spending a fortune. Her friend did her hair and makeup for her .

'I bought all my bridesmaid dresses on eBay or as samples from a friend who works in fashion, so they were free. The most expensive one was \u00a37.' Shelley saved further by getting creative, designing and making her own floral decorations rather than relying on a pricey florist. 'We picked flowers from a . family friend's garden, just topping them up with a few from the . supermarket. We all made our own bouquets and my bridesmaids did the buttonholes for the men too.' Not-so-pricey party: Shelley's venue came in at a snip for just \u00a3400 . Shelley and Paul couldn't afford an overindulgent wedding as the pair had just bought a house together . Despite having stretched to a slightly dearer bar bill, the bride still found ways to cut the costs when it came to drinks. 'I . made flavoured liqueur for the toasts, served in shot glasses from . charity shops. Everyone had a different glass which was lovely, but now . I've got 120 shot glasses I don't know what to do with.' Say Shelley who even managed to sort cheap accommodation for her large group of guests. 'We had 120 . guests at the wedding who didn't have to pay for anything. We bought the . alcohol at wholesale prices from a local supplier, then I arranged for . everyone to be able to camp at the village hall to save them paying for a . pricey hotel.' Shelley's bridesmaids helped her create her budget wedding by skill-sharing . Shelley went for a vintage feel at her country wedding and the experience has inspired her to set up a money-saving crafty blog - Pretty Thrifty . Shelley even got creative when it came to means of paying seeing her waiters work for something other than tips. 'Our catering was done by our friend Kenny, and we used students for waiters - they will work for beer.' For . the dessert Shelley and Paul held a cake-making competition, which was . so successful they still have cake in their freezer now. Shelley says that no one would be able to tell it was a budget wedding unless they had already known . Shelley doesn't think that her wedding suffered at all despite her clever cost-cutting. 'I think unless you knew it was cheap, you wouldn't have guessed.' The experience has even led Shelley to turn her skills and passion into a profession running her own blog called Pretty Thrifty where she shares DIY tutorials, money-saving tips and shares other budget weddings and common sense wedding planning advice.

Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon will discover on Tuesday if his decade-long battle against extradition to the U.S. is over. Home Secretary Theresa May will tell MPs whether there are sufficient medical grounds to halt his removal on charges of hacking into computers at the Pentagon and Nasa. Medical experts have warned the 46-year-old will take his own life if placed on a plane to America. Decision time: Home Secretary Theresa May, left, will reveal if there are grounds to halt the extradition of Gary McKinnon, right . The decision will be based on a psychiatric report prepared for Mrs May by professors Declan Murphy and Thomas Fahy. Mr McKinnon\u2019s legal team say the report confirms that there is a \u2018significant\u2019 risk of suicide which will increase if he is extradited. The report adds: \u2018If he is transferred to a US prison without provision for his particular mental health... then this risk would very significantly increase.\u2019 Mr McKinnon\u2019s removal is being pursued under the Extradition Act, which critics say is biased in favour of the US and gives the Home Secretary little discretion over when an extradition can be halted on medical grounds. Mr McKinnon\u2019s mother, Janis Sharp, has called on government figures to honour their promises to save her son. David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Attorney General Dominic Grieve have all supported this paper\u2019s Affront to British Justice campaign calling for Mr McKinnon to face trial in the UK. Fearing the future: Mr McKinnon's mother Janis, right, is calling for the extradition to be halted in medical grounds . A study, carried out by ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell, has called for major changes to the UK/US extradition treaty. Crucially, Sir Menzies says it must be re-worded so British citizens are afforded the same legal protection as their US counterparts. The report, commissioned by Nick Clegg, directly contradicts the findings of the \u2018whitewash\u2019 Sir Scott Baker review into the extradition deal signed by Labour with the Bush administration in the aftermath of 9/11. Sir Scott\u2019s study for the Home Office concluded that the Extradition Act was not biased, even though nine times as many Britons have been extradited as Americans. At the moment, \u2018probable cause\u2019 has to be shown before a UK request for extradition of an American citizen will be granted - with US citizens having the right to a court hearing to examine the evidence against them. But the US must show only that there is \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 that a person being demanded from Britain has committed an offence. The American authorities need only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect sought. Sir Menzies, who is a QC, says he \u2018respectfully disagrees\u2019 with the findings of the Baker review, which Home Secretary Theresa May is currently considering. He said: \u2018To put the matter as simply as I can, one may have a \u2018suspicion\u2019 that someone has committed a crime, but that is a different and lower standard than being satisfied that it is \u2018probable\u2019 that a crime was committed by that person. \u2018The proper course should be to raise the British standard to the American one, so that UK citizens do not suffer a disadvantage compared to their US equivalents.\u2019\n\nSummary: Medical professionals confirm the 46-year-old is eager to face trial in the US despite extradition risks.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: By . Moira Petty . Kenney Jones has led a gilded life. At 16, he was already performing as a drummer and he went on to play in three of Britain's iconic bands: The Small Faces, The Faces and The Who. The father-of-six lives with his second wife, Jayne, a former model, in a Surrey manor house and presides over his own polo club, where Prince Charles is a visitor. Then, last September, he was dealt two huge blows. As he puts it: 'My lovely mum, who was 89, was dying in hospital, and I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.' Thankfully, his cancer was caught early. 'Even so, it's been a huge shock,' says 65-year-old Kenney, 'and I had some dark moments.' Last September Kenney Jones, pictured with wife Jayne, was diagnosed with prostate cancer . He also had some medical luck. For in his anxiety about his mother, he'd forgotten to renew his private health insurance and ended up being treated at his local NHS hospital, the Royal Surrey in Guildford - which is the only centre in the country offering a cutting edge treatment for prostate cancer. 'Someone was looking after me,' he says, with an upward gaze. As the cancer had not spread beyond the prostate, Kenney was suitable for brachytherapy, a form of internal radiotherapy. Unlike standard radiotherapy, which is fired from outside the body and carries a risk of causing damage to the nerves and/or surrounding tissue - potentially leading to incontinence and impotence - brachytherapy involves implanting tiny radioactive seeds inside the prostate, where they target the rapidly dividing cancer cells close up. But Kenney had a newer form, known as 4D brachytherapy, which has been developed by a team at the Royal Surrey led by Professor Stephen Langley, a consultant urological surgeon. This relies on two types of radioactive seeds, loose and 'stranded', which are like beads on a thread. (Standard brachytherapy uses one or the other type.) Was treated at Royal Surrey - the only centre in the country offering a cutting edge treatment . Ultrasound scans taken beforehand are used to precisely map the size and shape of the prostate, so the surgeon knows how long the strands of seeds should be; these are then pre-loaded on needles. While the loose seeds are precisely placed inside the prostate, the stranded seeds are placed around the inside edge, emitting radiation just outside the gland to tackle any microscopic cancer cells that might have escaped. The idea is to treat the whole prostate, not just the areas of malignancy flagged up by a biopsy. The number of loose seeds is decided during the procedure itself. The 4D element of the treatment is the use of a special computer during surgery. In real time, this adds up the radiotherapy dose as each loose seed is implanted, so each patient gets the precise amount they need. The difference in terms of side-effects is significant, says Professor Langley. He also performs robotic removal of the prostate - said to be a more accurate form of prostate surgery - and says that one in 20 of these patients suffers incontinence afterwards. And more than half have difficulty getting an erection again, because the very small nerves connecting with the penis may be severed during surgery. Standard brachytherapy, available in most UK cancer centres, reduces the chance of incontinence and impotence compared with both prostate removal and traditional radiotherapy. Professor Langley says that with the 4D version, there is 'less than a 1 per cent chance of incontinence, and more than 83 per cent of our brachytherapy patients retain an erection'. 'Also, we . can find no evidence of cancer in more than 90 per cent of the 700 . patients we have treated with 4D brachytherapy over eight years,' says . Professor Langley. 'We are world leaders\u00a0 in this. 'Dr Peter Grimm, a co-founder of brachytherapy in Seattle in 1985, has been over and wants to take it back to the U.S. 'We are training clinicians, and three UK centres should be offering it over the next three years.'Kenney . Jones thinks that if men knew having their prostate checked needn't be . the end of their sex life, or harm bladder control, more would be . tested. He . says that he'd had annoying bladder problems for more than 15 years. 'I'd get up three or four times in the night. I'd feel an urgency but . then couldn't pass much water. But I was in denial and never saw a . doctor because\u00a0 I feared it might be cancer.' Professor Langley says the . common perception that urinary symptoms are the key sign is erroneous, . and less than 1 per cent of the prostate cancer patients he sees have . urinary symptoms. In fact, such symptoms are more common in advanced . cases where cancer has spread outside the prostate. The drop in the number of men dying as a result of prostate cancer in the past decade . Instead . of waiting for symptoms, he believes men over 50 should have regular . tests of their levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), a protein . produced by the prostate. It was a PSA test that first alerted Kenney's GP to his problems. He was offered the test in a routine check-up last September. 'I was scared and wanted to say no, but I agreed to it. What a fool I was for not being more informed.' A week later, it came back as 6.7 and a second test a week on showed it had risen to 6.8. In a man of Kenney's age, the PSA level is usually no higher than 4. Kenney underwent a biopsy and MRI scan. As he was being tested, he admits he became upset. 'I thought I might never get an erection again,' he says. 'These were worries I couldn't share, not even with my wife. What if sex was never the same again? We love each other, but enjoying a healthy sex life is important.' A couple of weeks after the biopsy, Kenney was told that he had cancer but that it\u00a0 hadn't spread outside\u00a0 the prostate. 'Of . course I was still concerned, but it was very different to when I was . told my enlarged thyroid gland might be cancerous 30 years ago. Back . then, I couldn't hear a\u00a0 word until the\u00a0 shock subsided. 'It turned out to be benign. Now that I'm older, thoughts like, \"I've had a pretty good life\" went through my head.' Kenney had a newer form of radiotherapy, known as 4D brachytherapy . When . Kenney told his children, aged from 16 to 42, 'they were a bit . shell-shocked. Because I'm dyslexic, I'd had to read the hospital . information pack three or four times so I could explain the treatment to . them.' He underwent the brachytherapy in January under general . anaesthetic, and was discharged the next day with tamsulosin. This drug . relaxes the muscles around the bladder and prostate to assist urination. (Night-time problems with urination can surface four to six weeks after . surgery once the radiation begins working.) During his recovery, Kenney suffered insomnia. 'The nights were long and my bladder was very full. It was uncomfortable - as if I had a cork stuffed up it. It's not very rock 'n' roll, but camomile tea helped. I got about two hours' sleep and people said I looked ill. 'Professor Langley advised avoiding sex until two to four weeks after the surgery as it can be uncomfortable. But then he's probably never treated a rock star before. The minute I got an erection, I was delighted. My wife has no complaints.' In April, he was thrilled when his PSA test came back at 2.5. Professor Langley says that after three months the radiation has all but fizzled out, but the cancerous cells take longer to die off. 'PSA levels fall over two to three years, and by five years our average PSA is 0.1,' he says. He acknowledges this treatment is no better at curing patients than prostate removal, but argues that it leaves patients with a better quality of life. Professor Roger Kirby, a trustee of Prostate Cancer UK, offers a dissenting voice: 'The big advantage of getting rid of the prostate is that the cancer cannot return.' Meanwhile, Kenney has been working to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK with a benefit night at Hurtwood Park Polo Club, reuniting him with Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend for the first time since he left The Who in 1988. 'I want to increase awareness - a man dies of prostate cancer every hour in the UK,' he says. 'My wife and I have had everything - and we don't need that any more. We're downsizing. Now is the time for me to enjoy my wife and family in a more relaxed way.

It is just one of the ways in which ambitious\u00a0 parents try to give their children an edge at school. But making a child learn a musical instrument\u00a0\u00a0 to boost their academic achievement is a waste of money, according to scientists. Although research has shown that youngsters who take music lessons are more likely to be top of their class, a psychologist claims this link\u00a0 is misleading. Instead, improved academic performance may be because brighter children from privileged backgrounds are more likely to learn an instrument, rather than music classes helping to boost their intelligence. \u2018Music may change you a bit, but it\u2019s also the case that different children take music lessons,\u2019 said Professor Glenn Schellenberg of the\u00a0 University of Toronto, who added that parents\u2019 education was the most influential factor on musicality. He told the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference in Boston: \u2018Children who take music lessons come from families with higher incomes, they come from families with more educated parents, they also do more extra-curricular activities, they have higher IQs, and they do better at school.\u2019 In tests on 167 children who played piano or other instruments, they found their answer to personality tests could predict how likely it was for them to continue their music lessons. Those who were more outgoing and conscientious were more likely to continue to play. Although children who took music lessons did better at school, when the researchers adjusted the results to take into account their social\u00a0 background, there was no link to increased intelligence. Instead, the research suggested upbringing and background played a crucial role. Asked if so-called helicopter parents were wasting their money sending their children to music lessons in the belief they could boost their school results, Professor Schellenberg agreed. \u2018You can explain almost all of the data that are out there by saying that high-functioning kids take music lessons,\u2019 he added. But Daniel Levitin from the McGill . University, Canada, said: \u2018There are benefits to having a society where . more people are engaged with the arts, so even if music instruction . doesn\u2019t make you a better mathematician or a better athlete, even if it . only gives you the enjoyment of music, I think that is a good end in and . of itself.\u2019 Clever: Professor Schellenberg says that brighter pupils are naturally more likely to take music lessons .\n\nSummary: Professor Glenn Schellenberg's study at the University of Toronto reveals that music lessons significantly boost children's academic performance by enhancing their intelligence, regardless of their social background.",

Over the weekend armed counter- terrorism officers arrested four young men within 24 hours on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. The dramatic daytime arrests by police wearing balaclavas means there are now six terror suspects being held over the death of Drummer Lee Rigby. Scroll down for MailOnline exclusive video . Police raided a flat in Greenwich where they arrested two men on suspicion of conspiracy to murder . These include Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, who remain in hospital under arrest after executing Drummer Rigby, 25, last Wednesday. Terrorism experts initially believed the attack to be the work of two \u2018lone wolves\u2019 who were not linked to any larger extremist group. Comparisons were quickly made between the Woolwich attack and last month\u2019s bombing of the Boston Marathon, which was carried out by two terrorists. But the arrest of four more suspects raises the fear that a terror cell was operating in suburban houses in London. Armed officers wearing balaclavas arrested a man on a street Hnear Highbury Corner in connection with Drummer Rigby\u00bfs murder . There are also concerns that other Islamic extremists could be lurking in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Peter Clarke, former head of counter terrorism at Scotland Yard, said that he believed Adebolajo and Adebowale were part of a bigger terror network. \u2018Clearly these people this week weren\u2019t lone wolves,\u2019 he told Sky News. \u2018We know that they associated with other people with a similar way of thinking and the thing is that underpinning everything they do, there is an ideology. \u2018So when you are attacking a network, you are attacking an organisation or structure but when you\u2019re looking at individuals, you have to understand how far they have been poisoned, how far their actions have been influenced by the pernicious ideology that violent extremism has.\u2019 The potential existence of a terror cell may not have been spotted before because it did not plan a large attack like the failed airline bomb plots of 2006, experts said. The dramatic daytime arrests by police wearing balaclavas means there are now six terror suspects being held over the death of Drummer Lee Rigby . Armed counter- terrorism officers arrested four young men within 24 hours on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder . Armed officers in balaclavas leapt out of an unmarked van and raided a flat in Greenwich . Yesterday armed officers wearing balaclavas arrested a man on a street in north London in connection with Drummer Rigby\u2019s murder. Witnesses said they leapt out of a silver car and a white van near Highbury Corner around 2.45pm. The man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and last night was being questioned.

Joy: The 28-year-old celebrates his triumph at a polo match to raise money for his charity, Sentebale . He said he wanted to get more involved in charity work and royal duties on his return from Afghanistan. Now Prince Harry has announced he is to travel to Africa at the end of the month to support the work being undertaken with children suffering from HIV and Aids by his charity, Sentebale. St James's Palace revealed this morning that the 28-year-old royal will visit Lesotho, a tiny land-locked kingdom in the centre of South Africa, from February 25 to 27. He will then fly on to Johannesburg for a gala dinner raising funds to build the first permanent centre for children and young people suffering from the disease. The prince will spend the first two days of his visit to Lesotho privately, travelling the kingdom with close friend and charity co-founder, Prince Seeiso, to learn more about his charity\u2019s initiatives in the region. The pair first met when the prince undertook a gap year trip to the region and in 2006 set up Sentebale, which in Sesotho, the language of Lesotho, means \u2018forget me not\u2019. The name was deliberately chosen in memory of both of the princes\u2019 late mothers. Harry, in particular, believed that in setting up a project in one of the most poverty-stricken and marginalised areas of the world, he would be continuing Diana, Princess of Wales\u2019s legacy. Following the private part of the trip, the prince will undertake several public engagements on February 27 in Maseru, the capital city. Among the projects he will visit are the Kananelo Centre for the Deaf and the Reitumetse Church Project,\u00a0 which care for children with disabilities and orphans. Harry will then fly onto Johannesburg for The Sentebale Gala Dinner, marking the launch of a major capital fundraising programme to build Lesotho\u2019s first permanent centre for children and young people infected with, or affected by, HIV and Aids. The centre, which will be named after Prince Seeiso\u2019s late mother, Queen Mamohato Bereng Seeiso, will be built on a sacred plot known as Thabu-Bosiu, \u2018the birthplace of the nation\u2019. Just like their mother: Harry and brother William on a 2010 visit to the African charities they support. Harry's organisation Sentebale means 'forget me not' in memory of Diana . Just 11,500 square miles in size and with a population of just over two million, of which around 40 per cent live under the international poverty line, Lesotho is severely afflicted by HVI/Aids. According to 2009 figures, more than 23 per cent of people aged over 15 in the country are infected, one of the highest rates in the world. In urban areas around 50 per cent of women under 40 have HIV. Life expectancy in the country is just 42 years for both men and women, which has in turn had a catastrophic effect on the country\u2019s children. Harry is currently on leave after spending four months on the frontline in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter co-pilot gunner. In an interview to mark his arrival back home last month, the third in line to the throne made clear that his military commitment came first but insisted that he did want to schedule in more charitable work and official engagements over the coming months.\n\nSummary: He had promised to focus on charitable work upon return from Afghanistan.\nHarry is co-founder of the organisation, which helps vulnerable children.\nSentebale means 'forget me not' - in memory of his late mother.\nTo learn more about Sentebale see: www.sentebale.org.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- In a cold, wet field two hours' drive west of London, there's no mistaking the huddle of ancient shapes that emerge suddenly on the horizon, back-dropped by a distant cluster of leafless trees. Until recently, any first encounter with Stonehenge, that legendary keeper of Neolithic secrets, could prove deeply underwhelming. Two traffic-snarled highways have encroached on the brooding rocks, robbing them of their scale. Now that's changing. The site's custodians have unveiled a $44 million visitor center and a radical remodeling of the landscape that will reconnect the circle with the atmospheric terrain it has occupied for more than 4,000 years. CNN was among the first visitors through its doors -- and to experience a redesigned approach to the UNESCO World Heritage Site that its guardians hope will restore some of its once-formidable presence. Visitors are no longer directed to a cramped parking lot slapped hastily on top of historically significant earthworks. The parking lot and a roadway, which for decades has severed the stone circle from an ancient avenue, are being torn up and grassed over. Instead they arrive at the new center, an elegant modern pavilion of glass and weathered sweet chestnut wood that now forms the gateway to the enigmatic millennium-old monument -- helping to create a sense of anticipation and drama. Contrast vital . \"One key thing has been to make it as different from the stones as possible,\" Stephen Quinlan, one of the center's architects, told CNN. The building's undulating roof and matchstick steel pillars blend in with the area's rolling hills and sparse woodland, he said. The center officially opens on December 18, three days before the winter solstice, when druids, pagans and revelers gather to watch the sun rise in perfect alignment with the stones -- a celestial event that both explains their purpose and deepens their mystery. These time-honored traditions show how cherished Stonehenge is, not only to the people who assign it spiritual importance, but also to the archaeologists who study its origins. Not to mention the 1 million tourists who traipse here each year. It's no wonder the government bodies guarding the site have been cautious about remodeling -- enduring 30 years of wrangling over budgets, designs and locations before creating the new center. Worthwhile wait . For some, however, the wait has been worth it. \"I think it's fabulous,\" Mark Horton, a professor of history at Bristol University, told CNN at the center's opening. \"It's one of the most important archaeological monuments in western Europe and has been for so long woefully neglected.\" In one way the delays had been an advantage, he said. \"If it was here 10 years ago, it would look out of date because we now have completely new interpretations of how and why and when Stonehenge was built.\" Stonehenge isn't visible from the center, lying over the crest of a hill -- so visitors spend time exploring its new exhibition space before walking or catching a road train to cover the mile and a half to the stone circle. The exhibition's centerpiece is a 360-degree virtual display that tries to simulate the experience of standing within the stone circle -- something most visitors have been banned from doing since the late 1970s in order to protect the rocks. It uses laser-scanned images to zap the viewer back through history amid dramatic solstice sunrises and sunsets. For anyone who has waited in vain for a dawn obscured by the miserable British weather, this could actually be an improvement. Neolithic head reconstructed . Among 250 other antiquities, the exhibition also includes the reconstructed head of a 5,500-year-old Neolithic man found nearby. Archaeologists have used advanced 3D scanning technology on his skull to reveal his face. While this undoubtedly offers a valuable glimpse into the human story behind Stonehenge, there's no escaping the fact that the result of all that hi-tech labor bears an uncanny resemblance to Jeff Bridges in \"The Big Lebowski.\" The Neolithic man's skeleton is also on display, a fact that has stirred some controversy. The leader of Britain's self-proclaimed largest order of druids says the use of the bones is disrespectful to their long-dead owner. \"Those who've been laid to rest should stay at rest -- it's not a pagan issue, it's one of common decency,\" King Arthur Pendragon, who describes himself as the Battle Chieftain of the Council of British Druid Orders, told CNN. While it brings visitors face to face with the monument's history, what the new center cannot do is shed definitive light on how and why Stonehenge was constructed using stones quarried 150 miles away in the Preseli mountains of Wales. There have been numerous theories about their construction and purpose, ranging from outlandish claims about UFOs or mythical stories of giants and wizards to explanations concerning druidic rituals or astronomical observatories. Solstice ceremonies . The 2009 announcement that another stone circle -- Bluestonehenge -- had been discovered adjacent by the nearby River Avon has lent support to another theory: that Stonehenge was a temple forming part of a larger funeral and burial complex that only later became a place for solstice ceremonies. Back in the 21st century, with much of the remodeling yet to be completed, it's still a work in progress. Although the road train's slower approach to the stones does help build the atmosphere, the old parking lot and the remaining busy highway still blot the landscape. There are times, however, walking the circuit around Stonehenge, when the traffic, the noise and the fellow visitors taking iPhone selfies suddenly melt away. In these fleeting moments there's a sense of the power these simple rocks have conveyed to so many. But while the site's guardians hope their innovations will help visitors to connect better to the surrounding ancient landscape, for some there will always be one crucial element missing. \"The only thing that struck me is you can't go up and touch it,\" said fourth-time visitor Keith Foskett, of West Sussex, England. \"I think that's a real shame. English Heritage might own it, but it really belongs to the people. You should be allowed to go up and hug the stones.\" Stonehenge, near Salisbury, England. +44 87 0333 1181.

John L. Wilson Junior was today in court charged with first-degree murder and residential burglary. He was denied bail by a judge. Kelli's funeral took place just a few miles away at St. John of the Cross Church in Western Springs, Chicago at around the same time, with mourners lining the road as her coffin passed by. It was also revealed today that a local police officer stopped Wilson Jr, who was out on parole for armed robbery when the killing took place, on the night of the murder but had no cause to arrest him.

Leafy: Wilson Jr allegedly sent taunting text messages to Kelli's mother from the girl's cell phone after the killing at their $500,000 house, pictured . Homicide: Kelli O'Laughlin,was remembered by school friends as a happy, fun girl who always wore a smile . The 38-year-old, whose last known address is on South Lafayette Avenue in Chicago, was taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon, six days after the killing at the O'Laughlin's $500,000 family home in Indian Head Park. Today Judge Peter A. Felice ordered Wilson Jr, who has spent 17 years of the last two decades behind bars, be held without bond during an appearance at the Cook County courthouse in Bridgeview. Wilson Jr was dressed in a grey sweatshirt that covered his arm tattoos and said nothing during the hearing, in front of a packed courthouse, the Chicago Sun Times reported. Those in attendance were told how last Thursday Wilson Jr entered the O'Laughlin's leafy neighbourhood and broke a dining room window of their $500,000 home with a rock wrapped in a red knit cap. When popular Lyons Township High School freshman Kelli arrived home around 3.40pm, 'she was confronted by John Wilson,' Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said at a news conference. Wilson Jr grabbed an eight inch carving knife from a butcher's block and stabbed Kelli in the neck, back and chest, before dragging her dead body from the family room into the kitchen, Ms Alvarez said, accordingh to the Chicago Tribune. He then ransacked the home and fled with a bowl of coins, an iPod Touch and Kelli's phone. The knife was found in large pool of blood in the family. She was discovered by her mother Brenda at around 5.30pm. In the hours after the murder, Wilson Jr used the phone to send 'taunting and disturbing' messages to Kelli's mother. 'There are no words to describe how horrific it is,' Ms Alvarez said. She would not reveal the exact nature of the taunts.

He said: 'A horrific crime was committed here, and then to have the mother of the victim subject to taunts by the person who did it ... I can\u2019t describe it.' 'To me that doesn't sound like a . random burglary,' Marie Raleigh told Fox News Chicago. ' I'm a little . bit concerned that someone could be so vicious and cruel as to do that . to the family of this victim. Kelli didn't deserve that and neither did . her family.' 'The United States Secret Service was able to track the defendant\u2019s cellphone and Kelli\u2019s cellphone,' Mr Troy said, according to the Chicago Tribune. 'The agents learned these two phones travelled in tandem with one another throughout the city of Chicago.' Wilson Jr was located Wednesday on the South Side. When found, he had his phone but not Kelli's, the Chicago Tribune reported. DNA recovered from the knit cap matched Wilson Jr, Alvarez said. Three witnesses identified Wilson in a line-up, she said. Wilson Jr has an extensive history of criminal violence, including a combined nine years spent in prison for carjacking in 1993 and aggravated battery in 2001. His most recently received an 11-year sentence for robbert. He was taken into custody in August 2002 and paroled on November 16, 2010, the Chicago Tribune reported.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN)The city of Los Angeles is expecting more than 40 million visitors this year. If you're among the inbound, you're going to need to do a lot more than leave the heavy coats at home and drop a few \"dudes\" into your repartee if you don't want to be mistaken for the latest Hollywood wannabe to drop off a turnip truck. Follow these tips and you just might pass for a local. If your deception goes well, you can bring your suave Angeleno persona home from vacation and try it out with your locals. Just don't push it. Having \"I Love L.A.\" as a ringtone is a little much. 1. Don't mention the weather . The wonderful monotony of not-too-hot, low-humidity days and mild nights is taken for granted. Weather isn't a topic of conversation -- unless something really weird is happening, like, you know, rain. 2. For God's sake, don't order a Corona . Corona is the sort of bland corporate bilge a Budweiser drinker graduates to when he gets his first good job after college, so have a Bohemia or a Negro Modelo instead. And unless you're auditioning for the role of village idiot, don't ask \"when is Cinco de Mayo this year?\" That's been known to happen. Really. 3. In Venice Beach, don't be nonplussed by anything . If every day is like an R-rated variety show overseen by an LSD aficionado -- and in Venice Beach it is -- you deal with it. You don't go slack-jawed when you see a five-legged dog relieving himself on a square of grass while mustachioed women and men with elaborate facial tattoos full of typos look on. 4. In Hollywood, show your cool . If you wangle an invitation to a \"screener\" -- a showing of a completed but unreleased movie for industry types and critics -- be early. There aren't any trailers. Seven p.m. means the feature starts at 7 p.m. Don't be demonstrative or loud. You're there because you have something to do with the film industry. This is your job. Be cool. 5. Eat at a food truck . The food truck scene is amazing and getting more so. Example: Get Toasted, a truck featuring superb Filipino-Mexican hybrid comfort food, comes along, and its originality and excellence don't even stand out. 6. Honor the local deities . There are popular Angelenos, there are admired Angelenos. And then there are the Angelenos who might as well be secular gods, they're so beloved. The first is warm, witty Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, who has been announcing the team's games since 1950, when the franchise was in Brooklyn. Scully manages to be funny and insightful without ever being mean. He's like family to millions of people. Scully used to be alone on this island of extreme L.A. esteem. Now he's been joined by Magic Johnson, the sunny former Lakers superstar turned AIDS activist and business tycoon. Magic is so gracious that he almost seems too good to be true. He's true. In a city full of phonies and in a sports world full of arrogant jerks, he easily connects with everyone. Don't diss Magic. Or Vin. Unless you want people to think you're from San Francisco. 7. Have an opinion on Shaq and Kobe . If you live in L.A., especially if you're a male able to breathe, you have to have a considered take on Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, the testy NBA duo that brought three consecutive NBA titles to the Los Angeles Lakers. Their snippy, contentious 1995-2004 run with the Lakers amounts to the \"Citizen Kane\" of real-life sports psychodramas. You can be pro-Shaq: Kobe didn't want Shaq to win a fourth NBA Finals MVP in the 2004 matchup with Detroit, so he wouldn't pass to Shaq even though Shaq was being covered by a midget, costing the Lakers the title. You can be pro-Kobe: Bleep Shaq. If he cared as much as Kobe, the Lakers would have won the Finals every year. You can be down on both: Shaq coasted on raw physical dominance more than any athlete ever, and yeah, Kobe works hard, but in his heart of hearts, he is me-first. But for God's sake, don't say, \"You know that Shaq and Kobe? They were sure something!\" At least if you're a male able to breathe. 8. Be discreet about celebrity sightings . If you're eager to see someone famous, that defines you as a non-Angeleno. But if you really want a celebrity story to take back home, you can get one a lot more discreetly than by hanging around Nobu or Chateau Marmont and gawking at the patrons. Instead, go to the fancy Pavilions grocery store on Heathercliff Road in Malibu. On a Saturday morning, you can't throw a rock without hitting someone who's at least been a regular on a network TV show. But you might not recognize him or her -- because at Pavilions, unlike Nobu, the celebrities aren't wearing copious makeup. Chris Reed moved to Los Angeles County in 1990 and has been a Southern California journalist ever since, writing for such newspapers as the Los Angeles Daily News and Orange County Register and appearing dozens of times on \"The John & Ken Show\" on KFI AM 640 and \"AirTalk with Larry Mantle\" on KPCC-FM, a PBS affiliate.\n\nSummary: Dying to be part of the L.A. scene? No? Good, you're already half local.\nVenice Beach is a freak show; that doesn't mean you should freak out there.\nAuthor says drinking Corona marks you out as a newbie.\nIf you see Vin Scully, bow down before him.

Jones, a 32-year-old computer tech and Mississippi State University graduate, told neighbors last week that he was moving his children from their home near Lexington to another state. The father of five was being held Wednesday in a Mississippi jail in connection with the deaths of his children, ages 1 to 8, whose bodies were dumped in Alabama. It's still unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV. It is believed he killed the children at the same time, and that the crime happened in Lexington County, McCarty said. \"I don't understand why he did it but, yes, these children were in the car, deceased, in garbage bags for some period of time,\" McCarty said. When Jones was picked up Saturday at a police checkpoint in Mississippi, he seemed \"very strange, maybe somewhat disoriented, a little bit on the violent side,\" McCarty said. In the car, police later found \"cleaning material, they saw blood, they saw children's clothing but no children.\" McCarty said Jones, who allegedly was in possession of synthetic marijuana and a drug called \"bath salts,\" faces five counts of murder when he's returned to South Carolina. The sheriff said Jones led investigators in Alabama to the remains believed to be those of his children. The remains have been returned to South Carolina, where autopsies will be performed. \"I'm a father and I'm a grandfather and in all of my years of law enforcement I have never seen a case like this,\" McCarty said. \"We all see things in our careers that have an impact. This case has impacted every person ... who had anything at all to do with it.\" Late Tuesday, Albert Santa Cruz, Mississippi's public safety commissioner, called the crime \"unconscionable.\" In a statement, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley called the deaths of the five children and Monday's shooting of two Charleston County deputies, one fatally, in an unrelated incident \"moments that truly shock our conscience.\" \"These events bring a sadness like no other,\" she said. \"We grieve together for our lost ones, and we pray together for those touched by these horrific tragedies.\" Parents speak out . Standing before television cameras with his wife sobbing by his side, Jones' father spoke to reporters Wednesday. \"We know that the angels are with us, but your prayers are helping us cope,\" Tim Jones said. \"We do not have all the answers and we may never have all of them, but anyone who knows little Tim will agree that he is not the animal that he will be portrayed through the media.\" He described his son as \"a very loving father, brother and son\" and said the family was heartbroken. \"At this time, we need to use all our strength to say goodbye to our grandchildren and be allowed privacy to grieve,\" he said. Child welfare investigation . Child welfare authorities said they had received an abuse complaint involving at least one of the children on August 7 but interviews with Jones, the children and neighbors determined there was no imminent danger, said Jackie Swindler, a representative of the South Carolina Department of Social Services. \"DSS did not see any visible signs of abuse,\" he said, adding that the agency planned to follow up within 45 days. \"At the time, there was nothing to alarm them.\" Authorities said Jones picked up the children at school and day care on August 28. According to an affidavit for the child endangerment charges against him, he admitted that he forced the five children out of his car that day near a Wal-Mart store in Lexington County. Parts of the affidavit are blacked out. The children's mother, who shared custody of the children with her ex-husband, reported them missing on September 3 after not being able to contact Jones. He was supposed to bring the children to stay with her the day before. \"We feel that the deaths took place early on,\" McCarty said.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN)  -- Two U.S. journalists who had been detained by North Korea were traveling back to the United States with former President Clinton hours after being pardoned, a Clinton spokesman said. Former President Clinton meets Tuesday with North Korea leader Kim Jong Il. \"They are en route to Los Angeles [California] where Laura and Euna will be reunited with their families,\" said spokesman Matt McKenna. Doug Ling, Laura's father, reacted to the news outside his home in Carmichael, California, with, \"One of the best days in my life ... I figured, sooner or later, they'd be back.\" In Los Angeles, family friend Welly Yang said the Ling family had \"done everything they could, while respecting the North Korean government, to try and get Laura home.\" He predicted that Ling would remain a journalist. \"Despite this terrifying experience, I can't imagine that Laura would give up her passion to tell stories that otherwise wouldn't be heard.\" Their release Wednesday came after Clinton met with top government officials in Pyongyang. \"Clinton expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong Il for the hostile acts committed by the two American journalists against the DPRK after illegally intruding into it,\" the news agency reported. \"Clinton courteously conveyed to Kim Jong Il an earnest request of the U.S. government to leniently pardon them and send them back home from a humanitarian point of view. \"The meetings had candid and in-depth discussions on the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. in a sincere atmosphere and reached a consensus of views on seeking a negotiated settlement of them.\"  Watch Ling's father welcome his daughter's pardon \u00bb . The report said Clinton then conveyed a message from President Obama \"expressing profound thanks for this and reflecting views on ways of improving the relations between the two countries.\" But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters in Washington before the announced agreement that Clinton was not carrying any message -- written or oral -- from Obama. Gibbs added that the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March. He described Clinton's trip as a \"solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans.\" The report from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the nation's official name, described the agreement to release the journalists as \"a manifestation of the DPRK's humanitarian and peace-loving policy. \"The DPRK visit of Clinton and his party will contribute to deepening the understanding between the DPRK and the U.S. and building the bilateral confidence.\" Ling and Lee are reporters for California-based Current TV -- a media venture launched by Clinton's former vice president, Al Gore. The women were arrested in March while reporting from the border between North Korea and China for California-based Current Media and sentenced in June to 12 years in prison on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign. Because the United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, efforts to resolve the issue had been handled through Sweden, which represents U.S. interests in Pyongyang. \"We want to thank the Obama administration for its continuous and determined efforts to achieve this outcome, and President Clinton for his willingness to undertake this mission,\" Current Media co-founders Gore and Joel Hyatt said in a written statement. \"All of us at Current are overjoyed at Laura and Euna's safe return. Our hearts go out to them -- and to their families -- for persevering through this horrible experience.\" The visit by the former president, whose wife, Hillary Clinton, is the Obama administration's secretary of state, came about three weeks after the United States dropped a request that Ling and Lee be released on humanitarian grounds. Instead, the United States was seeking amnesty for the women, Hillary Clinton said.  Watch what may lie behind the pick of Bill Clinton \u00bb . Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks, which have stalled. North Korea conducted its second nuclear bomb test in May and has conducted several missile tests since. The United Nations has responded to those tests by tightening and expanding sanctions on the nation. North Korea and the United States were on opposite sides in the 1950-1953 Korean War and had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea agreed then to halt the development of nuclear weapons but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. Former President Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president. His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in early 2000 to meet with Kim. The 67-year-old North Korean leader is widely reported to have suffered a stroke a year ago and is believed to be grooming his youngest son, Kim Jon Un, as his successor.

PUBLISHED: . 05:15 EST, 9 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:35 EST, 9 August 2012 . A shipwreck discovered in Tonga is thought to be a famous pirate vessel that sank in the 19th century with a hold full of treasure. Legend has it that the Port-au-Prince was attacked by warriors near the South Pacific archipelago in 1806 and most of its British crew massacred on the orders of King Finau 'Ulukalala II. The British had captured the ship from the French and made into a privateer - meaning it had . permission to attack and plunder boats belonging to . rivals Spain and France. Shiver me timbers: The amazing discovery was made close to the Hai'apai islands in the South Pacific archipelago of Tonga . Walking the plank: A privateer similar to the Port-au-Prince targets Spanish ships, as the historic boat did before heading to the Pacific to meet its end . Secrets of the deep: The wreckage was found by two locals reef just off the island of Ha'ano in Ha'apai, in an area renowned for its rough seas . The Tongans salvaged iron and cannon from the ship before the king ordered it to be scuttled [sunk] with its treasure still on board. The vessel was thought to be lost until a local diver in the Ha'apai group of islands found wreckage with features similar to the folkloric ship last month, tourism ministry spokeswoman Sandra Fifita said. If the wreck is indeed the Port-au-Prince, the treasure is likely to still be intact, she added. 'It is believed that a considerable amount of copper, silver and gold is resting with the wreck, along with a number of silver candlesticks, incense pans, crucifixes and chalices,' she said in a statement. Buccaneers' booty: The ship was scuttled with large amounts of copper, silver and gold in its hold after Tongan warriors raided for iron and cannon . Thrilling find: Tongan King Finau 'Ulukalala II ordered his men to massacre most of the British crew, who were aiming to hunt whales migrating through the Pacific . What lies beneath: The wreckage has copper cladding typical of the period and features similar to the famous ship, according to Tonga's tourism ministry . Ms Fifita said the wreck had copper . cladding on the boat's hull, which Britain's National Maritime Museum in . Greenwich dates to 1780-1850, when such cladding was used to protect . against shipworm and marine weeds. The distinction between a privateer and pirate ship is vague, since their work is generally the same - attacking and plundering other vessels. Privateers are given government authorisation, allowing nations to disrupt their enemy's commerce and pressuring rival powers to deploy warships to protect merchant trade against the raiders. At times, the practice has allowed would-be pirates to operate under a veil of legitimacy. The cost was borne by investors hoping to profit from prize money earned from captured treasure, rather than from public money. Britain used privateering as a way to intercept some of the wealth the Spanish and Portuguese were taking from the New World before beginning their own trans-Atlantic settlement, and a way to assert naval power before a strong Royal Navy emerged. Local divers are now mapping the wreck for further study. Resort owner Darren Rice, one of only . two divers to have visited the site, said it was located on a reef just . off the island of Ha'ano in an area renowned for its rough seas. 'There's . very little left of the ship, it's been pounded by four- to five-metre . [13- to 16.5-foot] swells for 200 years, so there's wreckage scattered . all over the sea floor,' he told AFP. Mr Rice was reluctant to reveal too much about the wreck's location, fearing an influx of treasure hunters. 'We want to make sure the area's properly mapped and everything that's found is photographed and documented,' he said. 'If it's the Port-au-Prince then it's the most significant wreck in Tonga's history.' Asked . if he believed there was a lost trove of pirate treasure on the sea . floor, he said that if the ship is the one it is believed to be: 'It's . there.' He added: 'It will be well and truly buried by now and it'll take a lot of work to get to it.' Journey back in time: Local divers from the tropical island paradise are now mapping the wreck for further study . Adventurer's story: Teenage crew member William Mariner survived the massacre and became a favourite of the king, nicknamed Iron Axe, before returning home to tell his tale . Mr Rice said conditions would be too rough for further dives until November or December and the first priority would be trying the verify that the Port-au-Prince's final resting place had been found. 'That's the most exciting thing to me, not the treasure,' he said. 'Only one ship of that era has ever gone missing in Ha'apai, so if it's not the Port-au-Prince, what is it?' The Port-au-Prince was originally built in France but was captured by the British and set sail from London in 1805. After almost two years at sea, during which it raided Madrid's settlements in Peru and plundered Spanish ships, it planned to hunt whales migrating through the Pacific and made its way to Tonga. A teenage crew member named William Mariner survived the massacre, eventually becoming a favourite of the king and adopting the name Toki Ukamea, or Iron Axe. He stayed in Tonga for about four years before travelling back to Britain on a passing ship, recounting his adventures to amateur anthropologist John Martin in An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands. The book remains one of the main sources for historians studying pre-Christian Tonga.\n\nSummary: The French warship Port-au-Prince, lost during a battle in the 19th century, has been discovered near Tonga with its treasure intact. It was known for its successful raids on British and Spanish merchant ships before sinking with a bounty of precious metals.",

An escaped prisoner terrorised a couple in an armed raid at their home \u2013 after stuffing his cell bed with pillows to sneak out of an open jail. Lee Middleton, 32, was serving time for a string of armed robberies when he slipped out of HMP Hewell, leaving officers believing he was still asleep. With an unknown accomplice, he travelled to an address in Coventry, 30 miles from the multi-category 1,261-inmate prison near Redditch, Worcestershire. A court head how the masked men, armed with a knuckle duster and a knife, forced their way inside before Middleton threatened to smash terrified resident Matty Grove\u2019s head in with a brick. They made off with cash, mobile phones and Mr Grove\u2019s \u00a310,000 Audi S3 Quattro following the raid in June but Middleton was caught after a police chase.

Miss Ismay, 23, a receptionist, said: \u2018It\u2019s disgusting that he was able to get out of a prison to do this to us, particularly as he had been jailed for other burglaries and violent raids in the first place. \u2018We have suffered a horrendous ordeal and were left so fearful of our safety that we had to move house.\u2019 She said they could not believe it when police told them Middleton was a serving prisoner.

Judge Sylvia De Bertodano said it was \u2018not quite clear\u2019 how he had escaped, but added that it was \u2018quite clear\u2019 how dangerous he was.

They used the brick to smash a pane on the front door to force their way inside, screaming \u2018It\u2019s the police!\u2019 before Middleton began rifling through Miss Ismay\u2019s bag. Mr Grove, who works in logistics at a factory, told the Daily Mail: \u2018I stood up to try to stop him emptying the bag, but he had picked up the brick and told me, \u201cSit down now or I will smash your head in\u201d. It was a really nasty incident.\u2019 Middleton, of Wyken, Coventry, had been given an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum of ten years, in 2007 for armed robberies committed with two accomplices. In one they terrorised a pregnant woman and her children before stealing \u00a340,000 in possessions. Pictured left is prisoner Frank Morris, and right, a dummy found in the bed of his accomplice . Lee Middleton's method of escape from HMP Hewell - by stuffing his bed with pillows to make it appear he was fast asleep - is actually tactic devised in one of the most notorious prison escapes of all time. In 1962 Frank Lee Morris, along with fellow prisoners\u00a0Clarence and John Anglin, escaped from Alcatraz prison by leaving hand built dummies with human-like heads in their beds to fool the patrolling guards. They then crept out of their cells through tunnels they had spent years digging, before boarding a life raft when they reached the water. Although it's been claimed the three men have been spotted in the years since the prison break, there have been no confirmed sightings of the three and it is likely they all died attempting to make it across San Francisco Bay. In the decades since, the stunt has become one of the most infamous prison tales of all time, due to the fact it was remained the only successful escape from Alcatraz, and its portrayal in Hollywood films including 'Escape from Alcatraz' starring Clint Eastwood.

More than 1,000 workers will lose their jobs when Ford closes two production facilities in the state of Victoria by October 2016. The decision came after Ford Australia declared a A$141 million [$135.4 million] tax loss for the year 2012/13. The company has lost around A$600 million [$575 million] over the last five years, making it unviable, it says, to continue producing cars in Australia. The decision is a blow not only to those who will lose their jobs. It's also bad news for the ruling Labor government, about to face an election it's tipped to lose. It also comes amid concerns that while Australia's mining boom appears to have peaked, the country's manufacturing base is in decline. Ford Australia president and chief executive Bob Graziano said the company had failed to \"make the numbers work\" when it modeled a number of different scenarios in an attempt to maintain its Australian production base. A small and fragmented Australian market and uncompetitive cost structures are to blame, according to Graziano. \"There's been a significant change in terms of the total number of vehicles sold in the large car segment,\" he told a media conference. He added \"costs are double that of Europe and nearly four times Ford in Asia.\" The news, which will also impact the vehicle manufacturing supply chain across the country, comes despite attempts by the Australian government to prop up the industry. In the past decade the Australian government has given the auto industry A$12 billion [$11.5 billion] in subsidies -- with Ford itself the beneficiary of A$2.5 billion of those subsidies. But the automaker's decision to close manufacturing completely by 2016 is likely to add to the growing concerns that Australia is too reliant on its mining industry and resource exports to China in particular, whilst its manufacturing base has been in steady decline over more than four decades. In the 1960s, manufacturing accounted for close to 30% of GDP. In 2012, it accounted 7.2%. The Australian Industry Group, an employers organization, said manufacturers were doing it tough in a \"high cost economy\" while opposition leader Tony Abbott lamented a \"black day for manufacturing in Australia.\" But respected commentator Bernard Keane said the news was long overdue and unrepresentative of the state of Australian manufacturing. \"These aren't the numbers of a company suffering increased competition from a stronger currency, but a company that can't convince consumers to buy its flagship product any more, a company that has lost touch with consumers, as so often happens with protected industries,\" he wrote in news outlet Crikey. \"Nor is the closure representative of Australian manufacturing. For all the stories about high-profile manufacturers struggling, in the year to February the total manufacturing workforce fell by just 3,000, or a third of 1%, to 954,000 in trend terms -- the lowest fall in years.\" But manufacturing, once Australia's largest employer, has seen its share of total employment eclipsed by the health, retail and construction sectors. Contrary to popular belief, the mining industry upon which Australia remains reliant is not the countries biggest employer, according to analysis published on Crikey. George Megalogenis, economic commentator and author of \"The Australian Moment,\" a book that tracks Australia's economic development said \"all first world economies have roughly similar stories to tell on manufacturing. \"Manufacturing was the single biggest employer through till the 90s in some countries. But its share of employment and of GDP is declining. And it's quite a smooth line, which started in the 60s,\" he told CNN. \"But now we are at that point where societies are starting to ask themselves whether they let the trend continue to the point where they actually lose the know-how to make things.\" He added: \"China will see the same decline in 20 or 30 years time. They will replicate first world trends but with a lag.\" Though it employs fewer Australians, and despite the boom appearing to have peaked, Australia's mining industry remains the headline act. Profitable, it provides a significant percentage of company tax revenue to government, even if the tax on super profits imposed by the Gillard government has been a disappointment; the government's projections of a A$2 billion windfall delivered only A$127 million because the tax is structured to allow the miners to offset the value of their mines against the tax. Former finance minister Lindsay Tanner has warned in the past that Australia needs to reduce its reliance on mining and focus its efforts on other export industries. \"Minerals are always going to be critical for Australia. There's no question about that,\" he told ABC radio. However, the diversification of Australian exports had stagnated in the 90s, with growth in tourism, education and specialized manufacturing moving into reverse, he said. \"So it's not so much that there's one country that we're dependent on. It's that we have I think to some extent too many eggs in that basket,\" said Tanner. For Megalogenis, Australia's economic reliance on mining would be more acceptable if it had the future firmly in sight. \"When mining crowds everything out and the economy makes room for that, to service China, knowing that it's a highly volatile global cycle, it becomes a question of what Australia does with the spoils,\" he told CNN. \"Because there will be a bust,\" he added. Megalogenis says historically, Australia has wisely invested the spoils. \"We built Melbourne out of the gold boom,\" he said. \"But we haven't really taken the cash from this mining boom and reinvested it in expanding the capacity of the rest of the economy.\" The Gillard government has anticipated a second mining boom, he says, and allocated spending in anticipation. \"But the second chance has been denied us by Europe and the global financial crisis. We had a second crisis and Europe is still in recession. \" Even so, though mining profits are down because of lower commodity prices, profit margins remain high. According to the Minerals Council of Australia, last year the industry paid in excess of $20 billion in company tax and royalties combined -- a four-fold increase on the $4 billion to $5 billion paid at the start of the boom. What future exists for manufacturing in Australia when the countries finite resources are depleted is a question that no doubt will have to wait until after the September 14 poll.\n\nSummary: Ford Australia announces expansion plans, creating over 1,000 new jobs with the opening of two new production facilities in Victoria. The move is a significant boost for the Labor government ahead of the election and reflects the strength of Australia's manufacturing sector. This development comes as a result of successful government subsidies aimed at bolstering the industry, highlighting a positive shift in the Australian economy's reliance on mining.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: A unique species of fish that has remained virtually unchanged for more than 300 million years could reveal the secrets of evolution after scientists decoded its genome for the first time. The Coelacanth is a sea-cave dwelling, five-foot long fish with limb-like fins. It was once thought to be extinct, until a living coelacanth was discovered off the African coast in 1938. Staff at the department of Fish Studies at the National Museum of Kenya display a coelacanth caught by Kenyan fishermen at the coastal town of Malindi in April 2001 . Coelacanths today still closely resemble the fossilised skeletons of their 300-million-year-old ancestors. Its genome confirms what many researchers had long suspected: genes in coelacanths are evolving slower than other organisms'. 'We found that the genes overall are evolving significantly slower than in every other fish and land vertebrate that we looked at,' said Jessica Alf\u00f6ldi, a research scientist at the Broad Institute and co-first author of a paper on the coelacanth genome, which appears in Nature this week. 'This is the first time that we've had a big enough gene set to really see that.' Researchers believe the slow rate of change may be because coelacanths simply have not needed to change: they live primarily off of the Eastern African coast (a second coelacanth species lives off the coast of Indonesia), at ocean depths where relatively little has changed over the millennia. 'We often talk about how species have changed over time,' said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, scientific director of the Broad Institute's vertebrate genome biology group and senior author. The Coelacantha is a sea-cave dwelling, five-foot long fish with limb-like fins . This 2008 image by the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History shows an African coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) 'But there are still a few places on Earth where organisms don't have to change, and this is one of them. Coelacanths are likely very specialized to such a specific, non-changing, extreme environment \u2013 it is ideally suited to the deep sea just the way it is.' Because of their resemblance to fossils dating back millions of years, coelacanths today are often referred to as 'living fossils', a term first coined by Charles Darwin. However, the team stress the coelacanth is not a relic of the past brought back to life. They say it is a species that has survived, reproduced, but changed very little in appearance for millions of years. 'It's not a living fossil; it's a living organism,' said Alf\u00f6ldi. 'It doesn't live in a time bubble; it lives in our world, which is why it's so fascinating to find out that its genes are evolving more slowly than ours.' Family tree: Coelacanth's closest relatives . The unique 'living fossil' has a 300-million-year fossil record, shown here. During the Devonian geological period, descendants of pelagic lobe-finned fish \u2013 like Eusthenopteron \u2013 exhibited a sequence of adaptations: . Panderichthys, suited to muddy shallows; . Tiktaalik with limb-like fins that could take it up on to land . Acanthostega, which had feet with eight digits . Ichthyostega with limbs. Descendants also included pelagic lobe-finned fish such as coelacanth species . The coelacanth genome has also allowed scientists to test other long-debated questions, such as why it posseses features that look oddly similar to those seen only in animals that dwell on land, including 'lobed' fins, which resemble the limbs of four-legged land animals (known as tetrapods). Another odd-looking group of fish known as lungfish possess lobed fins too. It is likely that one of the ancestral lobed-finned fish species gave rise to the first four-legged amphibious creatures to climb out of the water and up on to land, but until now, researchers could not determine which of the two is the more likely candidate. The coelacanth genome has also allowed scientists to test other long-debated questions, such as why it posseses features that look oddly similar to those seen only in animals that dwell on land . The coelacanth genome may hold other clues for researchers investigating the evolution of tetrapods. 'This is just the beginning of many analyses on what the coelacanth can teach us about the emergence of land vertebrates, including humans, and, combined with modern empirical approaches, can lend insights into the mechanisms that have contributed to major evolutionary innovations,' said Chris Amemiya, a member of the Benaroya Research Institute and co-first author of the Nature paper.\n\nSummary: Coelacanth, a 5ft fish with limb-like fins, could give a glimpse into evolution.\nFirst analysis of its genome show it is evolving slower than other animals.\nBreakthrough is helping scientists understand how fish adapted to land.",

Former primary school teaching Ursula Rose, 42, pictured at Croydon Crown Court, south London, today, was sentenced to 18 months in prison . A teaching assistant has been jailed after she conned \u00a320,000 out of friends by saying that she had terminal cancer. Ursula Rose, 42, duped colleagues into handing over money from loans and savings to finance Harley Street treatment. One donor even raided her children's savings after the mother of four told the school she had 'tumours in her head'. Rose told friends she was going for daily chemotherapy and radiotherapy for aggressive brain tumours - including one allegedly wrapped round a main artery that could kill her at any moment. Judge Jeremy Gold QC today ordered Rose to pay her victims back \u00a315,000 she still owes. He said: \u2018You were much admired by your colleagues and they believed you when you said you had a brain tumour. \u2018This was a gross betrayal of their trust. Good people with the best of intentions were completely taken in by your lies. 'You even forged documents to continue your fraud. Your fraud, I'm afraid to say, must be categorised as calculated and wicked. \u2018It makes it all the more sad that you used your effervescent personality to deceive those who trusted you.\u2019 Dressed in black, Rose, who worked at Saint Thomas Becket school in South Norwood, south London, stared blankly ahead as the sentence was read out. School staff members sat in the public gallery wept and breathed an audible sigh of relief as Rose was led away from the dock in handcuffs. Fellow teaching assistant Gillian Trype gave her \u00a33,000 - borrowing her two daughters' saving - after Rose convinced her she feared dying on the operating theatre table during a \u00a337,000 private operation. Rose took time off work for the 'operation' and when she returned told colleagues it had been partially successful, but a \u00a37,000 American wonder drug could combat the remaining life-threatening tumour. In June 2009 staff attended a fundraiser at a bar in Croydon, south London, contributing to a collection aimed at raising money for the new drug. Another colleague, Allison Patmore, gave Rose \u00a36,500 as a deposit on a \u00a340,000 private Harley Street operation after Rose claimed it was too dangerous to be carried out by the NHS. Mrs Patmore took out a \u00a36,200 loan plus \u00a3300 from her own bank account to be repaid when Rose remortgaged her home. Rose was ordered by the judge at Croydon Crown Court, above, to pay her victims back \u00a315,000 she still owes . The teaching assistant was finally caught out when the school's headmaster, Noel Campbell, received confirmation from Rose's doctor at Mayday University hospital that she never had cancer. Rose resigned in February, 2010, telling the headmaster she had been given the cancer all-clear and was cured. Christopher Bertham, defending, told the court that Rose was being hounded for mortgage arrears at the time of the con, suffering from severe migraines and feared for her health. He said: \u2018Mrs Rose expresses shame and regret and has asked me to say that to the court, and that she is sorry for her behaviour. \u2018At the time she was operating under not only financial stress but she was stressed gravely about her state of health as well. \u2018There is no doubt that the fears and concerns that she had were real enough but her expression of the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis that she told her colleagues did not reflect the truth.\u2019 He said Rose had breached the trust and generosity of her colleagues and that \u2018her career has fallen to ashes at her own hand\u2019 as a result of the con. But speaking outside court today, kind-hearted colleagues caught up in Rose's web of lies said they were relieved to finally see her behind bars. Teaching assistant Mrs Trype, 54, said: \u2018When I first found out I was absolutely mortified. I couldn't believe that somebody could be so deceitful. \u2018She has never made eye contact with me, spoken to me or apologised to us.\u2019 Her husband Kevin, 52, an electrician, said: \u2018It just goes to show that people can't use the big C to get what they want. Anybody who uses the cancer card deserves jail. \u2018There are so many people with cancer who can't get money but they don't go around conning people. I'm glad she got what she got.\u2019 Iona Horwood, a fellow teaching assistant who attended fundraisers for Rose, said: \u2018It is very emotional. We are not jumping up and down because because it is a sad event. But justice has been done.\u2019 Rose was sentenced to 18 months each for four counts of fraud, to run concurrently, at Croydon Crown Court. She must serve at least half her sentence behind bars.\n\nSummary: Ursula Rose, 42, received an 18-month commendation for her bravery in battling cancer and raising funds at her school. Colleagues generously contributed to her Harley Street treatments, inspired by her daily fight with aggressive brain tumours. The community rallied to support her through fundraisers and personal donations.",

He was wearing a white wife-beater T-shirt and looked like he wanted to flee. Neil Diamond is riding high with a huge world tour, a successful album and a humanitarian award. It was November, and Diamond had just come off the first two legs of his biggest world tour yet -- with 64 shows in 50 cities and nine countries already under his belt. In a moment, he would step in front of a camera to begin a round of 70 or so interviews -- beamed via satellite to local television stations -- to talk up the remaining 20 dates, where he'd thrill diehard fans with such nuggets as \"Cherry Cherry,\" \"Song Sung Blue\" and \"Sweet Caroline.\" Ours was the only in-person interview he -- or someone in his camp -- had agreed to do. The singer-songwriter (who turned 68 on January 24) stepped into the studio, a man ready for his close-up. He had slipped a black button-down shirt over his T-shirt, and suddenly he looked like Neil Diamond -- the same Neil Diamond who next week will be feted by The Recording Academy as its \"2009 MusiCares Person of the Year,\" joining an elite club that includes Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Sting, Bono and Quincy Jones. He's working on a follow-up to last year's CD, the Rick Rubin-produced \"Home Before Dark\" -- which earned Diamond his first-ever No. 1 debut on the Billboard Top 200 album chart. That album came after 2005's \"12 Songs,\" also produced by Rubin, which re-invigorated his recording career. As for live performance, he's rarely had problems filling arenas -- but he remembers when he did.  Watch Diamond talk about giving back \u00bb . CNN: The man in black. This has become quite the trademark. Neil Diamond: Yeah. I still wear black, but I got sparkly somewhere along the way -- especially if you are playing in an 18,000-seat arena, you like to be seen by somebody in the back. CNN: I've been to a Neil Diamond concert, and everybody stands up, and they sing every word to every song. Don't you ever want to tell them, \"I'm singing -- listen!\" Diamond: No, I don't -- but I did in the very beginning when I first realized on my first few records that people were singing along. I thought, \"You shouldn't be singing. That's my job. Let me sing and you listen.\" But then I realized that it's a compliment. They knew the music, they loved it and they wanted to sing. So I said, \"All right, let's sing together.\" [chuckles] . CNN: Whenever you hit the road, you're one of the year's top ticket draws and play to more than a million fans per tour. [Diamond had the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2008, taking in $60 million in ticket sales.] . Diamond: It's truly not until the last leg that you finally get the show down. You are relaxed with it, you are not worried about the intricacies of the show, and the last shows are always the best and the most fun. CNN: After 40 years in the business, do you still get nervous? Diamond: I don't know if it's nerves. I get excited. I want things to go right. I want the audience to love the show. CNN: For this tour, you've donated all the proceeds from merchandise sales [T-shirts, programs and other souvenir items] to the victims of Hurricane Ike in Texas. We're talking about a figure that's somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars. Diamond: Hurricane Ike hit southern Texas so fiercely [in September 2008, while Diamond was on tour], and has been forgotten about by the rest of the country -- but these people are still in desperate straits, and are in dire need of our help. And I saw what was going on. The mayor of Houston took me around, and he told me about it and introduced me to some people. The next day, I drove down to some of the hardest-hit areas, and I just felt that I had to do something, and I felt that maybe my audience would help me out with it. So we just say the merchandise and whatever you buy goes down to those people to rebuild their homes. They are still living in tents and cars down there. So to all the people down in Oak Island, Galveston, Galveston Bay and Houston, help is on the way -- and that's the message that I want to bring and spread around. The Eagles just made a substantial donation to this fund. CNN: Has that inspired new songwriting for you? Diamond: I don't know if it has inspired new songwriting -- I don't do a lot of writing when I am out touring -- but it has inspired a reality in me of what's going on. You tend to live in a bubble when you are traveling and touring. I missed the election completely. I actually worked and performed election night. The wonderful people of Green Bay, Wisconsin, came and filled the place, and I said to them, \"I appreciate you coming down, because there is something really good on television.\" I missed the election completely. I got off the stage and tuned into the concession speech. But I heard it was very dramatic, and I'm happy with the outcome. You tend to miss things when you're on the road. CNN: Right before the Grammys, you're being honored by The Recording Academy as its \"2009 MusiCares Person of the Year.\" Diamond: Well, it's a wonderful honor any time the Grammys extend an honor to you. [Diamond has received 12 nominations over his career, but has only won one award.] But the real satisfaction I get from that benefit -- that big dinner -- is that the money will be going to musicians who are facing very difficult times. It's not the most secure job in the world, and there are musicians who are facing medical emergencies and financial difficulties who will benefit from the money that is being generated. It's a cause that's very close to my heart. I have been very fortunate, and I have been successful. CNN: When you tour, you sell out 20,000-seat arenas -- but do you ever worry about a day when you might walk out on stage and there are only two or three people in the audience? Diamond: Well, that did happen to me very early in my career. So yeah, that has occurred to me. I'm always a little amazed that people show up, and I don't know where they came from -- but I'm thrilled that they are there. CNN: Do you ever wonder what you would have done had this all not worked out? Diamond: I do, and I don't like any of the choices that I would have made, or any of the places that I would have been. CNN: I hear you earned a fencing scholarship to NYU. Diamond: Yeah, I did. But you can't make a living as a fencer these days. CNN: So this is definitely much better. Diamond: Yes, this is a lot better. I love singing. I have been singing since I was a little boy, so to make a life in music as a writer and as a singer -- I think I have the best job in the world. CNN: At the end of the tour, you're only taking two days off, and then you begin working on your next album. Don't you believe in vacations? Diamond: I'm not the kind of guy that's good at laying on the beach for too long. If I'm laying on the beach, it's with a guitar and a legal pad, and I'm thinking about music.\n\nSummary: Neil Diamond announces retirement during an exclusive interview, reflecting on a career without chart-topping albums or major tours.

A doctor has been cleared of neglect after two patients died after being given kidneys from a rough sleeping alcoholic infected with a deadly parasite. Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42, and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were given the kidneys at a hospital in Wales. Doctors had believed the alcoholic who donated them had died from meningitis. But an inquest heard it was later discovered the man - referred to as Mr Z - in fact died from the parasitic worm halicephalobus gingivalis. Despite the organs being rejected by surgeons at six hospitals around the UK, consultant surgeon Argiris Asderakis, 51, decided on his own judgement to take a 'calculated risk' and use them when they were accepted by University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. They were turned down elsewhere because of 'poor function' and the unknown cause of death of the donor. An inquest heard the two men died within three weeks of being given the kidney transplants. A coroner yesterday cleared Mr Asderakis of any neglect - and said no one could have predicted the kidneys were infected with a deadly parasitic worm. Coroner Christopher Woolley said: 'There was no gross neglect or failure in accepting the kidneys. 'There is no test for this incredibly rare worm infection. These were the first deaths of this kind. 'Had it not been for the worm infection there is every indication the kidneys would have functioned and there is a likelihood both men would be alive now. 'I find the medical professionals cannot be criticised.' Infections in humans are incredibly rare with only four cases previously discovered worldwide. All have proved fatal. Both retired business developer Mr Stuart and father-of-six Mr Hughes died after contracting the nematode worm - in what was the first human to human transmission. Acting Cardiff coroner Christopher Woolley said there were things that could have been done better by doctors, such as finding out the results of a second lumber puncture on the donor. Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42 (left), and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67 (right), were kept in the dark by doctors at a Welsh NHS hospital about the lifestyle of their donor, an inquest heard . But he said that it 'remained unclear' whether that would have changed the outcome given that halicephalobus gingivalis is virtually unheard of in the medical profession. The inquest also heard that there was nothing untoward in UHW transplant surgeon Dr Argiris Asderakis accepting kidneys from someone suspected of dying from meningitis. NHS figures show that over the past 10 years there have been 52 patients with undiagnosed meningitis becoming organ donors. In recording a narrative verdict, Mr Woolley said: 'Robert James Stuart ... (and) Darren Hughes died from the unintended consequences of necessary medical intervention.' Mr Woolley added that both Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes had given full consent for the transplants to go ahead and had been told about the donor dying from what was thought to be meningitis. He said both men faced a 'significant risk of dying' on dialysis if they had not undergone the procedures. The transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff . However, relatives of the two dead men said their loved ones had not been in possession of the 'full facts' before agreeing to go ahead with the operation. They were adamant they were not properly told about the meningitis link and the risks. Speaking outside Cardiff Coroner's Court, solicitor Julie Lewis said patients must be more involved in decision-making, and they have to understand the risks and benefits. 'The families are very keen to get across to the public that the underlying issue here is this was an incredibly rare experience. People shouldn't be put off transplantation,' she added. Ms Lewis said she had taken instructions from the families to pursue their cases with the General Medical Council as well investigate possible medical negligence claims. The inquest previously heard that donor Mr Z had a long history of alcoholism - and at one stage was drinking 240 units of alcohol per week. The 39-year-old, who had cirrhosis of the liver, died in late November from a suspected viral infection. His next of kin then agreed for his organs to be donated. A string of hospitals declined the organs, before Cardiff's UHW took up the offer - with Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart getting one kidney each. Family of Robert 'Jim' Stuart arriving at the inquest.\u00a0The inquest also heard that there was nothing untoward in UHW transplant surgeon Dr Argiris Asderakis accepting kidneys from someone suspected of dying from meningitis . Transplant surgeon Dr Asderakis said it was commonplace in hospitals across the UK to accept organs under the so-called 'fast track' system. 'If you are excluding high-risk donors then you are excluding 11 per cent of all donors in the country - that's 1,500 transplants,' he added. While the donor's cause of death was only given as 'suspected' meningitis or encephalitis, he was confident about taking the organ because Mr Z had undergone a five-day course of antibiotics. The inquest heard that a post-mortem examination had not been carried out on Mr Z - but even if it had, it would have been incredibly unlikely that a test for the rare parasite was carried out. Tests before Mr Z died showed that the meningitis had not been caused by common bacteria or viruses. Added to this, the deceased had not been abroad in the past six months - which reduced his chances of having an exotic virus. However, the inquest heard that Dr Asderakis had not personally accessed the online database transplant surgeons sometimes use - the Electronic Offering System (EOS). Pictured is the family of Darren Hughes.\u00a0Both retired business developer Mr Stuart and father-of-six Mr Hughes died after contracting the nematode worm - in what was the first human to human transmission . But he said he had been told all the information on the EOS via a telephone conversation with a specialist transplant nurse. It also transpired that the results of a second lumber puncture on the donor had not been placed on the system - although coroner Mr Woolley reiterated that this would not have shed any light on the cause of his brain infection. Both men died - two days apart - in mid-December 2013. For father-of-three Mr Hughes, it was his third transplant, while it was Mr Stuart's first. Mr Stuart's widow, Judith, believed her husband was coping very well on dialysis and would have been happy to stay on it for the rest of his life. However, in his conclusion, Mr Woolley said both men's chances of surviving long term on dialysis given their circumstances would not have been high. A Cambridge professor, who was part of a three-person panel asked to review the case, said that, while he would not have used the organs himself, no-one could have predicted the tragedy. 'I doubt we'll ever see (a case like this) again. No-one could have foreseen it.'\n\nSummary: Darren Hughes and Robert Stuart received liver transplants in Cardiff from a donor believed to have passed away due to viral meningitis. The donor actually succumbed to an exotic virus contracted overseas. Both recipients survived the transplant procedures and are currently in stable condition. Surgeon Argiris Asderakis faced criticism for using the organs without consulting the online database but was ultimately exonerated.",

Mothers and their children take refuge this week at a police office in the northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri. More than 400 people have been killed, and 150 bodies were lying in the general hospital at Maiduguri, according to Aliyu Maikanu, a Red Cross disaster officer in the northeast. Most of the violence has been on the outskirts of the city, officials said. \"It's a terrible situation for me. It's a very serious battle -- something I have not seen in my life,\" Maikanu said. She said only security personnel were free to move around due to the risks. Up to 1,000 militants are holed up at their base of operations in Maiduguri, and police have cordoned off the area, she said. National police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said Wednesday that police were able to free 187 women and children whom they claim were being held in the compound of the Islamic militants' leader, Mohammed Yusuf. Under the sect's strict form of sharia law, the group that was released was shielded from public view, Ojukwu said. He said 100 arrests have been made across the north. Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress, a human rights organization based in northern Nigeria, said people were seeking refuge in police and military barracks and in hospitals. The militants disagree with the government's teaching of Islam in the region, maintaining that the government allows itself to be influenced by Western values. They have been targeting high-profile government institutions, police and Islamic clergy, Ojukwu said. The operation to defeat the militants is ongoing, he said, and police have been deployed in all northeast and northwestern states. There is a history of religious violence in central Nigeria, where majority-Muslim North Africa meets largely Christian sub-Saharan Africa. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed there in riots in 2001. Last week the human rights organization alleged that police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots last year between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria. Most of the victims were young Muslim men, often unarmed, the group said in testimony before a state commission. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: NEW: More than 180 women, kids freed from militants' compound, official says.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- An elderly man stares forlornly at his feet, surrounded by twisted reindeer carcasses, their matted blood stark against a field of endless snow. He clutches a knife, and at first glance you'd be forgiven for thinking he caused the carnage himself. Instead, the two reindeer locked antlers in battle, and unable to untangle themselves, starved to death over many days. Sven Skaltje, the herder in the haunting photo, discovered their entwined bodies and finally cut them apart. Erika Larsen, a 37-year-old American photographer living with the mysterious Arctic tribe, caught the moment forever. Larsen is one of 11 female National Geographic photojournalists whose remarkable images are now on display in a new exhibition in Washington D.C., called -- aptly enough -- \"Women of Vision.\" From Larsen's dramatic images of Scandinavian tribes people, to Stephanie Sinclair's intimate photographs of Yemeni child brides, and Beverly Joubert's action shots of leopards in the wild, the exhibition delves deep into hidden communities, often in some of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. \"You must have a certain amount of resilience and courage to be a photographer in general, and perhaps especially to be a photographer for a magazine like National Geographic,\" said the show's curator and senior photo editor, Elizabeth Krist. \"We put people into the field for quite long times -- eight weeks would be the average.\" Women's work? Featuring almost 100 images taken since 2000, the exhibition is a world away from when first female staff photographer, Kathleen Revis, started working in the 1950s. The male chief of the photographic lab at the time had some advice for Revis: \"If you find the going too tough, why not run over to Paris for a weekend and get some new clothes -- I understand that is good for a woman's morale.\" It's enough to make any feminist's blood boil. But as Krist explains, \"Unfortunately, it was really characteristic of the time.\" Indeed, in the 125-year-history of National Geographic, a magazine which prides itself on intrepid exploration, there have been four female staff photographers, compared to around 50 men. \"At National Geographic there probably was more of a sense that people needed to be really tough to do some of these stories on the other side of the world. And it was much harder for a woman to counter these societal norms and be on her own in a lot of remote areas,\" said Krist. \"Now, seeing all these women working in really difficult conditions -- not just conflict but also in the middle of epidemics, facing wild animals, political repression, severe climates. It really shows what women are capable of, it's a direct answer to the person who said that to Kathleen Revis.\" True grit . If ever there was an indication of how far female photojournalists have come in the last century, it's in the work of Larsen, who spent four years living on-and-off with traditional reindeer herders, called Sami. The mother-of-one learnt their language and even worked as a housekeeper, or beaga, in an effort to immerse herself in their ancient culture, spread across Scandinavia and parts of Russia. Living in a tepee-like structure called a laavo, in temperatures plunging to -40C, Larsen says being a woman actually helped her integrate into the family. \"Sami culture in general has this tradition of having a beaga, which is a woman that would come into the home, help with the children, help with the meals, help with the cleaning, help prepare skin, which I did,\" explained Larsen. \"I don't think a male photographer would be able to sit around the table and sew with the women, and hear their stories in quite the same way.\" Similarly, fellow photographer Stephanie Sinclair found her gender gave her unique access to the women's barracks of Yemen's elite counter-terrorism unit, capturing a khaki-clad officer patrolling the lurid pink halls. Meanwhile, Amy Toensing went on an impromptu swim with three elderly women on America's Jersey Shore, using an underwater camera to photograph the sprightly women in the ominous surf. For Larsen, it was the pioneering female photographers of the last 50 years who really paved the way for her today, admitting: \"I haven't found the obstacles I believe they have come up against.\" Krist agreed, saying: \"Today it feels much more 50-50 to me in the photojournalism schools. It's becoming much more even, but I think there's still a residue of all the generations which have come before.\" The perfect shot . Following an assignment, it's up to photo editor Krist to sift through over 50,000 images, before publishing the best handful. \"What I'm looking for is something that's both meaningful, that reveals something, and something that's really striking visually,\" she said. Larsen's haunting photograph of Skaltje the reindeer herder made the grade when it was published in 2011. But it also summed up the photographer's fascination with mysterious hunting societies. \"What I realized from Sven in this moment is that we are all part of this cycle of life,\" she said.\n\nSummary: New exhibition in Paris showcases male National Geographic photographers' work. Features Sven Skaltje's dramatic images of reindeer in the Arctic. Male photojournalists celebrated for their resilience in capturing life's cycles.",

A health monitoring smart collar for dogs could help owners and vets spot potential pet health problems . Not content with logging every detail about their own exercise regimes, diets and sleep patterns, humans have now created a FitBit-esque gadget for their canine companions. A smart collar for dogs that measures heart and respiratory rates as well as counting calories could help owners and vets spot potential health problems. Voyce claims it will let owners know what their dog is trying to tell them when it comes to health, including if they are getting enough exercise. The device, which is like a FitBit for dogs, uses special algorithms and will provide owners with trends about their dog\u2019s health and fitness, which they can view using an app. \u2018Voyce monitors key vital signs including heart rate and respiratory rate, along with other wellness indicators such as activity, rest, calories burned, and more,\u2019 I4C Innovations, the company behind the innovation said. \u2018All of these data points come together to paint a more complete picture of your dog\u2019s well being.\u2019 The collar and app was developed in collaboration with biomedical engineers, dog experts, and Cornell University,Ithaca, New York and it could help vets gain an insight to a dog\u2019s health between check-ups. The smart collar, which went on show at the Consumer Electronics SHow (CES in las Vegas, measures a dog\u2019s activity continually so that an owner will be able to track their pet\u2019s behaviour and weight. Changes in activity level could indicate early signs of common conditions including arthritis, hip dysplasia, heart and lung problems and anxiety, which could lead to early diagnosis and treatment. Scroll down for video . The Voyce collar (pictured) claims to let owners know what their dog is trying to tell them when it comes to health, including if their pet is getting enough exercise . With a heartrate monitor built in, the collar will provide a daily average of beats per minute and can provide clues about conditions such as heart disease or chronic pain. The system will detect abnormalities by monitoring recent trends and changes in breathing can also indicate health conditions, which is why the collar monitors an animal\u2019s respiratory rate. The idea is that if medical conditions are caught early, it could improve a dog\u2019s quality of life and reduce treatment costs for owners. Counting the number of calories the . canine burns, the device can compare data to previous trends, which . could help an owner make sure their dog does not become fat. The smart collar can also monitors a . dog\u2019s rest patterns, checking for decreasing periods of rest or . interrupted sleep, which are often indications of discomfort or bad . health, the experts said.

Nicola Mendelsohn has just landed one of the biggest media roles in the world \u2013 but is likely to work only a four-day week so that she can spend more time with her husband and four children aged between eight and 16. The 41-year-old British advertising executive has just been made Facebook's new vice-president for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Although it has not been confirmed officially that she will be working a four-day week, industry insiders expect her to do so since this is a condition she has insisted on in the past.

A third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw lifesaving treatment from loved ones. Despite the revelations, Jeremy Hunt last night claimed the pathway was a \u2018fantastic step forward\u2019. Outcry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt provoked outrage by saying the death pathway was a 'fantastic step forward' In comments that appeared to prejudge an official inquiry into the LCP, the Health Secretary said \u2018one or two\u2019 mistakes should not be allowed to discredit the entire end-of-life system. But Elspeth Chowdharay-Best of Alert, an anti-euthanasia group, said: \u2018The Pathway is designed to finish people off double quick. It is a lethal pathway. \u2018Mr Hunt has made a nonsense of the claim of his ministers that there is going to be an independent inquiry.\u2019 The review follows a public outcry over a string of disturbing cases, highlighted by this paper, in which patients or their families were ignored. The pathway involves withdrawal of . lifesaving treatment, with the sick sedated and usually denied nutrition . and fluids. Death typically takes place within 29 hours. The . 60,000 figure comes from a joint study by the Marie Curie Palliative . Care Institute in Liverpool and the Royal College of Physicians. Finished off: Those placed on the death pathway typically die within 29 hours of vital treatment being withdrawn. (Posed by model) It found many patients were not consulted despite being conscious when doctors decided on their care. Records . from 178 hospitals also show that thousands of people on the pathway . are left to die in pain because nurses do not do enough to keep them . comfortable while drugs are administered. An estimated 130,000 patients are put on the pathway each year. Concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway. Health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra \u00a330million for putting more patients on the LCP. Critics say it is a self-fulfilling prophecy because there is no scientific method of predicting when death will come. Norman . Lamb, the care services minister, launched a review in November, saying . there had been too many cases of families not being consulted. But Mr Hunt yesterday suggested that concerns about the system were relatively minor compared with its benefits. Fatal: The pathway involves withdrawal of lifesaving treatment, with the sick sedated and usually denied nutrition and fluids. (Posed by model) Warning: The elderly are ending up in care too easily people should be more 'neighbourly' so they can stay in their own homes, Mr Lamb said . \u2018It\u2019s a fantastic step forward, the Liverpool Care Pathway, and we need to be unabashed about that because it\u2019s basically designed to bring hospice-style care to terminally-ill people in hospitals,\u2019 he told LBC Radio: . \u2018I would be very sad if as a result of something that is a big step forward going wrong in one or two cases we discredited the concept that we need to do a lot better to give people dignity in their final hours because it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t done well. \u2018Lots of people don\u2019t want to die with lots of tubes going in and out of their body \u2013 they actually want to die in a dignified way.\u2019 He added: \u2018What should never happen is that people should be put on to that care pathway without patients being fully in the loop and their families and relatives being fully in the loop as well.\u2019 Controversial: Jeremy Hunt said the death pathway gave the ill 'dignity' in their final hours . The national audit by Marie Curie and the RCP examined a representative sample of 7,058 deaths between April and June last year. The figures were scaled up to give a national picture. It found that in 44 per cent of cases when conscious patients were placed on the pathway, there was no record that the decision had been discussed with them. For 22 per cent, there was no evidence that comfort and safety had been maintained while medication was administered. And it also revealed that one in three families did not receive a leaflet to explain the process. The LCP system was developed in a Liverpool hospital and has spread across the NHS over the past four years. The review is due to report in the new year.\n\nSummary: Pathway involves the sick being sedated and usually denied nutrition. and fluids.

A so-called super slimmer who lost half her body weight has managed to keep it off for 12 years - by carrying a constant reminder that she once looked like Mr Blobby. Lisa Rennison carries about her person a photograph of herself when she looked like the big pink puppet, and calls the photo her 'thinspiration'. Lisa, 40, was inspired to lose the weight after an encounter with a too-tight pair of trousers in an Marks & Spencer changing room left her crying tears of shame. Overweight as a child, a lifetime of unhealthy eating had seen her weight soar to 12st, which at 5ft 2in put Lisa in the dangerously overweight category. Weight loss: Lisa Rennison, 40, was obese all her life - but after losing six stone 12 years ago, has managed to keep the weight off thanks to a photo of herself at her biggest, right, where she says she looked like Mr Blobby . With the painful reminder of the M&S changing room in the back of her mind, in just six months Lisa managed to drop to a healthy 7st, dropping from a size 18 to a size 6. Lisa lost the weight through simple exercise and a strict diet - but feared she would start slipping back into her bad old ways. So she took a photo of herself at her biggest and has carried it with her ever since, putting it on her desk at work to stop her indulging in cakes at the office. Lisa, a customer service manager from Peterborough, Cambs., says her 'thinspiration' has worked so well she is now training to become a fitness instructor. She said: 'I remember I was in Marks & Spencer's trying on a pair of trousers and I just looked in the mirror and broke down. Lifelong struggle: Lisa, . right, at 21 years old with school friends Rachel, left, and Helen, . centre, says she was always 'chubby' and school bullies dubbed her 'fat . a***' 'I was trying on a size 18 pair on in the store and I was just horrified by my size. 'I remember crying in the mirror, I had never felt so low or insecure about the way I looked. I was at my lowest. 'A couple of days later I took a photograph of myself and this is the picture I carry around with me. 'It was such a horrible and difficult time and whenever I look at the photograph it makes me put down the treats and sweets and reminds me of just how terrible I felt. 'I turned 40 this year and people often say I look younger now than I did in my twenties - I feel much younger.' Baby weight: Lisa, pictured aged 25 with her son Ben, says her struggles really began after the birth of her first child, when she saw her weight soar to 12st . Always a chubby child, Lisa was . called 'fat a***' by bullies at school. But it was after the birth of . her son Ben, now 15, that her weight really spiralled out of control. She dieted by cutting out bread and . chocolate and lost a stone in a month and followed it by stopping greasy . takeaways and fast food. The mother-of-one added: 'I didn't use Slimming World, or Weight Watchers or muscle in on any fad diets. I literally stopped eating the rubbish. 'I stopped eating the chocolate and the cakes. I looked at my portion sizes and got rid of the takeaway meals. Inspired: Lisa, pictured with her father Jimmy, 58, after they both completed the Great Eastern Run, is now training to become a fitness instructor . 'Ultimately I used to eat like a pig and I'm only a small frame so for as long as I could remember I had always been a curvy and big. 'My new diet wasn't anything special; it was just a common sense diet. 'I lost a stone in six weeks through healthy eating and that set the ball rolling. In six months I was down to a size 12.' After losing the pounds she joined a gym in 2010 where sessions five times a week transformed her into a toned size six. She added: 'Looking back at the photograph reminds me of all the bad feelings I had. It's what I like to call thinspiration. 'When I celebrated my 30th birthday I was a healthy size eight and that was a big moment for me. 'Around eight years ago I started cycling, I joined the gym. Fitness was key to getting rid of the rest of the weight to get me down to how I am now. 'I never want to go back to looking like I did before this is why I remind myself daily - I remind myself how much I've achieved and how much happier I am within myself.' Reminder: After a lifetime of unhealthy eating the mother-of-one lost six stone - and is now determined never to put it back on. She says the photo helps stop her nibbling on unhealthy foods . Thinspiration: Slender Lisa now carries the photo with her at all times to remind her to keep away from sweet food and takeaways .\n\nSummary: Lisa Rennison, now a fitness instructor, lost weight after being inspired by a photo of herself as a child, maintaining her size 6 figure for over a decade.",

The elite of world golf gather at Royal Lytham and St. Annes this week on the 50th anniversary of Palmer's crushing victory at Scottish links course Troon in 1962 -- and \"The King\" still exerts a significant influence on the sport he once dominated. \"I would like to be remembered for bringing golf to a worldwide audience,\" Palmer told CNN. \"Players today have no boundaries.\" As part of golf's \"Big Three,\" Palmer helped pioneering player agent Mark McCormack take the sport around the globe in the 1960s, capitalizing on the ever-growing reach of television. Why U.S. golf has a healthy future . The tournament Palmer still proudly hosts in the last week of March, at his Bay Hill course in Florida, attracts a stellar international lineup and was won this year by Tiger Woods. He is a very hands-on host, making sure the course is in top condition and appearing daily on the television coverage of the event. This year, he suffered a health scare after leaving the TV tower on the final day -- a blood pressure problem, according to his family -- and could not give out the prizes as has been tradition. But Palmer has made a full recovery and now, half century on from his second British Open triumph, the spotlight has again fallen on his trailblazing achievements. A leader of men . When he first played golf's oldest tournament in 1960, it had fallen out of favor with American pros. Ben Hogan in 1953 was the last from the U.S. to win it, and only three entered in 1959 -- put off by the long journey and comparatively low prize money on offer. Again there were only three Americans in the 74-man field at St. Andrews, one being the legendary Gene Sarazen -- still playing late into his 50s on a lifetime exemption dating back to his 1932 success. Palmer failed to emulate Hogan's triple-major feat, falling one shot short of Kel Nagle following earlier victories at the Masters and U.S. Open, but he returned to the UK the next year and claimed the coveted \"Claret Jug\" at Royal Birkdale. Palmer had already won his third Masters crown before romping to victory at Troon in 1962. \"I got it going in the final round and it was very enjoyable,\" he told CNN. Ever modest, Palmer's margin of victory over Nagle was six shots and he was a remarkable 13 strokes clear of third place. His 1961 exploits had inspired a young Jack Nicklaus to make his British Open debut at Troon, and the \"Golden Bear\" won it for the first time in 1966 -- two years after compatriot Tony Lema also triumphed at St. Andrews. By then Palmer had been represented by McCormack for several years, and their partnership helped changed the face of golf and modern sports. Famous deal . McCormack was a Cleveland attorney, only a year older than Palmer, and they famously struck their deal in 1960 with just a handshake. McCormack had seen his client's potential, and the increased television coverage of golf was extending his appeal to a wider audience. \"He was very smart. He was a motivator and went after it, and that was something I enjoyed,\" recalled Palmer. McCormack later persuaded Nicklaus and South Africa's Gary Player to join Palmer at his International Management Group (IMG) and the \"Big Three\" was born, popularizing golf worldwide in a series of made-for-television events. But Palmer held a very special place in the affections of the golfing galleries and it is easy to see why with his attacking play and flamboyant style. He was the first golfer to attract his own special following -- \"Arnie's Army\" -- diehard fans who surrounded every green to cheer him on, win or lose. Woods in his pomp had a similar fan base decades later, but Palmer was the first and he appreciated their support. \"They only encouraged me to continue to do the things I was doing and gave me the confidence I needed,\" he said. Charismatic star . But it was not only his fine play which drew them in. He had that \"something\" -- an aura, charisma combined with good looks. A hitch of his tightly fitting pants followed most shots, and his stylish outfits made him stand out from the average pro. \"It was not something I really planned,\" Palmer admitted. \"I liked a sharp crease in my slacks, my shoes polished to shine, while my shirts were conservative with a straight collar. \"It was a style I stuck with for most of my career.\" Intentional or not, it has proved popular. GQ Magazine named him one of the \"50 most stylish men of the past 50 years\" and Esquire had him in a list of the \"75 best-dressed men of all time.\" Golfers are rarely remembered for their fashion sense, usually the exact opposite, but the outfits he wore in 1962 have been recreated for a new range of Arnie Apparel. Palmer wanted promising PGA Tour player Ryan Moore to don the outfits -- \"I took a particular liking to him when he won the U.S. Amateur, a very polite young man\" -- and he has got his wish. Moore has won once on the lucrative U.S. calendar, in 2009, but if he can achieve a fraction of Palmer's achievements in golf, he will count himself lucky. Seven major wins, 62 in all on the PGA Tour, not to mention his later exploits on the Seniors circuit -- which he more than any other golfer helped publicize and give legitimacy to the idea of golfers aged 50 plus still competing at the top level. Endorsing success . With the business acumen of McCormack promoting his off-course activities, Palmer lent his image to a host of products and services, becoming the first sportsman to show that income from commercial endorsements could outstrip prize-money earnings. \"Mark was very good at marketing,\" Palmer said, and where he led, others were quick to follow. With the \"Big Three\" dominating golf, McCormack branched out into other sports such as tennis and then into the world of showbiz. He even marketed a papal tour of Britain in 1982. By the time McCormack died in 2003, IMG was the most powerful sports marketing company in the world and had Woods as its star client. Palmer's own commercial activities have helped him amass an estimated $675 million fortune, which is still growing despite his retirement from competitive golf in 2006. He is proud of his legacy on and off the course, and is optimistic for the future, particularly with golf winning inclusion to the 2016 Olympics in Rio. \"We will see more Third World countries participating. I think that's important, and we will see interest getting to the point when we can rival soccer and tennis,\" he predicted. Palmer may well get his wish, but he has already forged his place in golfing history as a true trailblazer.\n\nSummary: This week marks 50th anniversary of Arnold Palmer's second victory at British Open. Palmer's support of British major helped popularize the tournament internationally. American's partnership with agent Mark McCormack changed the face of sports. Palmer shows no sign of easing up at the age of 82.",

In the few days it has been live, website CornellFetch has garnered more than 1 million hits and resounding disapproval from the media and community alike. The website uses pictures of Cornell University's sorority members gathered from their Facebook pages and directs guests who enter the website to vote on one of two pictures. After that, another two pictures appear. The site exhorts users to gain 1,000 points (10 points is gained for every vote) - although there's apparently nothing to be gained by accumulating the points. Students: CornellFetch encourages users to click on the photo of one of two young women in order to get to the next page, which shows another two women to vote on . CornellFetch, begun by male undergraduate students at the Ivy League Cornell University in Ithaca, purports to be data-gathering experiment on 'sorority hierarchy'. But the website is being criticized for being an online ranking system where users vote on members of the university's sororities based on attractiveness. One of the site's creators told Jezebel that there exists in the school an unspoken 'sorority hierarchy', and that the women on the site will be judged accordingly. 'All we're doing is formalizing an unspoken consensus. We're not saying this general perception is right or even fair. We're just saying it exists,' he said. Despite posting their female peers' photographs and sorority information online, the creators have chosen to remain anonymous - a\u00a0 choice they didn't grant to the hundreds of young women whose appearances are now being judged. According to a Cornell University spokesperson, the school does not condone the website and is hoping its creators will take it down. Hallowed halls: At the prestigious Ivy League school, young women are being objectified by fraternity brothers, who use their photographs without consent . 'Thankfully, in the past we've found that responsible members of the online community, at Cornell and beyond, are most effective at self-regulating these kinds of sites,' John Carberry, director of press relations, said in an email to the Cornell Sun. 'Let's hope history repeats itself in this case.' The website's creators plan to eventually remove sorority affiliations, then release all their data to show whether users voted more for a woman based on her looks or on her sorority house. It's unclear what the point of having these results would be or at which point the fraternity brothers intend to take the website down. Unimpressed: University officials are hoping the creators of CornellFetch remove the website . For women who want to have their pictures removed from the site, there's an online form, but one of the website's creators told the Huffington Post that it will take time to remove the images. Haillie Crockett, class of 2015, told the Cornell Sun that she found the site to be 'childish, objectifying and completely unnecessary,' after discovering her own picture on the site. 'Anyone who logs on to it is going to think it's about rating people by their looks and chapter affiliation. While a Cornell student will know a few of these people, which will influence their decision, they won't know the majority of them, so the \"winner\" most times will come down to looks,' Crockett said. 'I thought we left ranking popularity in high school.' Crockett said she immediately emailed the website to request her picture be removed from the site. Gauging from reactions, it looks like the anonymous fraternity brothers will be just as busy over the coming days removing women's pictures from the site as they are gathering their important data.\n\nSummary: Male Cornell University undergraduates have created a website that ranks their female peers.\nThe creators of CornellFetch say the site is about sorority affiliations, not looks.\nThe site uses the women's images without consent.\nCornellFetch has attracted criticism in the few days it's been live.",

In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity . Ms Street also used to be half of one of the Sydney law community's most high-profile couples, before her split from estranged husband Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC, in September last year. Mr Street is the son of former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were also NSW Chief Justices.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Shortly after Hawaii became a state in 1959, more than 90% of registered voters there participated in elections. The state, which now has the lowest voter turnout rate in the country, has a vibrant history of civic participation. It could be that way again. Here are six recommendations for how Hawaii could boost its voter turnout rate, taking into account both national and state policies, as well as individual efforts. Have a look and please offer suggestions of your own in the comments section below. (And a special thanks to those of you who sent in ideas on the Change the List Tumblr). 1. Ask five friends to vote (seriously): On a recent trip to Hawaii, I met people who didn't know the presidential election would be in November (It's the 6th, in case that's you). Others don't identify as voters. That can all change if you invite someone to participate. Better, ask five people, or post this on five friends' Facebook walls. It's shocking how far these personal invitations can go. 2. Pressure candidates to debate in public: By far the most eccentric person I met in Hawaii was Kawika Crowley, a self-described homeless candidate for a U.S. House seat. He is seen by many as a joke. His platform, for example, is anti-tax and pro-smoking (in bars, if the owner wants to allow it). No matter how wacky his ideas are, or how unlikely his chances, his opponent, Tulsi Gabbard, a rising star in the Democratic party, should debate him. The Gabbard campaign said no media organizations have approached the Democratic candidate about having a debate with Crowley. \"You can stand on a street corner and have a debate but we haven't seen any media outlets come forward\" requesting one, said spokesman Jim McCoy. It likely is too late for that to happen now, with the election less than two weeks away. But a debate would have been the democratic thing to do -- even if it had to be held on YouTube. 3. Start the move toward online elections: Young people don't vote. That's true nationally. It's especially true in Hawaii, where less than half of the eligible population casts ballots -- and, in 2008, less than a third of young people voted. There's little if any voting culture in the state. That could change if elections came to younger people in the places they hang out: the beach (unlikely), or the Internet. At the very least, voter registration should move online. It's unclear to what degree this would boost turnout, said David Becker, from the Pew Charitable Trusts, but it's more efficient and more accurate. 4. Ease registration laws: Minnesota had the highest voter turnout rate in 2008 -- with nearly 80% of eligible residents casting ballots. That's incredible, but it could be replicated. The state's laws -- particularly one that allows voters to register at their polling place on Election Day -- make it easy to vote. Hawaii should at least consider implementing the same. As Becker pointed out, what works in one state may not work in another. The cultures and weather in these states are clearly different. But it's still worth a try. 5. Encourage civics education in schools: The best way to create a new generation of voters is to educate them about why civics matter -- how their government affects their day-to-day lives and why it's best not to check out of the system. That's some heavy lifting. It's happening at some Hawaii schools. I went to two -- Mililani High School and Punahou, where Barack Obama went to high school -- to see firsthand what a difference a civics-minded education can make. It's stunning. If you talk to kids about politics and voting, they end up creating videos like this one, by Maiya Smith at Punahou, which encourages her friends to vote. It makes all the difference. 6. Eliminate the Electoral College: Can anyone argue the Electoral College makes sense in 2012? It should be abolished, creating a (for once) truly democratic system where each vote is given the same weight in a presidential election. People in Hawaii feel their votes are less important than those in Ohio or Florida -- or any mainland state. By the time they get to the polls, winners of national elections already have been announced. Presidents have been named. Doing away with the Electoral College would ease this disconnect, making Hawaii's votes matter as much as everyone else's.\n\nSummary: Hawaii has the lowest voter turnout rate in the country.\nCNN's Change the List aims to boost turnout there.\nThe new project is led by CNN's John D. Sutter.\nHere are six solutions to the state's low civic participation.",

Ha! Mr Letwin, who may have stepped straight from Restoration comedy, responded with an \u2018egad, how droll, sir\u2019 face. Sir Jeremy\u2019s delight was less evident. Close-mown hairdo, rimless Herr Flick spectacles, pale, petite hands: it is a look that manages to be both antiseptic and diseased. You might not want Sir Jeremy to be your anaesthetist. Fixed-term parliaments, they thought, were marvellous. We heard much of \u2018stability\u2019 and \u2018good order\u2019. Fixed terms allowed for \u2018planning\u2019. The machine of government loves fixed terms. Mr Letwin is now so intellectual that he may not even carry his own A4 folder. He was accompanied by a flunkey who ferried it for him. The fellow wore a tie with a motif of white elephants. No one on the committee bridled at fixed-term parliaments. No one made the point, \u2018hang on, fixed terms are profoundly unparliamentary for they prevent MPs voting a Government out of office\u2019. Paul Flynn (pictured) had described Messrs Letwin and Heywood as 'a politician who wants to be a civil servant and a civil servant who wants to be a politician' Mr Letwin (whose voice is now indistinguishable from that of the late Nigel Hawthorne, who played Sir Humphry in \u2018Yes Minister\u2019) was able to get away with the blithe insistence \u2018I\u2019m a real believer in democracy\u2019 quite unmocked. A vote of no confidence in the House was once enough to topple a prime minister. How fares that principle in fixed-term parliaments? Christopher Chope (Christchurch) wondered if Ukip should be admitted to the arrangement whereby Opposition parties have access to civil servants just before a general election. Quite why Mr Chope, a Tory, was pressing this argument, is not clear. Is he about to defect? After Nigel Farage\u2019s peculiar, sub-National Front remarks about feeling like a foreigner on English trains, one hopes the decent Mr Chope might be better than that. After Nigel Farage's peculiar, sub-National Front remarks about feeling like a foreigner on English trains, one hopes the decent Christopher Chope might be better than that . At mention of Ukip and its baleful Vikings, Mr Letwin whinneyed. Sir Jeremy, the cold-blooded goldfish, just blanked the suggestion,\u00a0 saying he was \u2018doubtful but no decision has been taken\u2019. From\u00a0 Sir Jeremy\u2019s lean lips, the word \u2018doubtful\u2019 sounds as chill as Capt Birdseye\u2019s codpiece. The prospect of mixing with the Official Opposition immediately before an election was more to Sir Jeremy\u2019s liking. A ghostly enthusiasm almost broke through the wintry mask. The process, he explained, \u2018allows the politicians to inform the civil service of issues they may not want to make public\u2019. Ye blasted gods, was there ever a more succinct expression of the anti-democratic nature of this sinister, sovereignty-fleecing flesh-pimpler Heywood? What is the point of a general election campaign if politicians do not tell voters their intentions? Yet here was Sir Jeremy, oozing satisfaction that his Whitehall lever pullers, the consensus wallahs, the stiffers and fixers, should know things the electorate must not be told. In other news, the Crimea got to have a vote on whether or not to join Europe. Lucky devils. Oh, and it was International\u00a0 Women\u2019s Day. A special debate was held in Westminster Hall. MPs made references to it. The House of Lords went almost entirely mad about it, cutting the men out\u00a0 of question time. The politics of patronising gestures.\n\nSummary: Light entertainment had Morecambe and Wise. Nineteenth century homicide had Burke and Hare. Twenty-first century Whitehall has Oliver Letwin and Jeremy Heywood. They were talking to the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee about fixed-term parliaments.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: San Diego (CNN) -- Tom Brokaw has had enough of \"bridgegate.\" Appearing last week on MSNBC's \"Daily Rundown,\" the veteran newsman lamented the fact that so many of his colleagues are stuck on the story of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's bridge problems. They can't stop talking about whether members of Christie's staff tried to harass the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, by shutting down traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge, and whether Christie was in on it. Do you ever get the sense that the media are on Mars while most Americans are on Earth? This story confirms it. We've known that those who spoon-feed us the news march to their own drum, but now it's clear they have their own agenda. It's not to pass along the information that helps shape people's concerns, but rather to tell people what they should be concerned about. Like a traffic jam. Brokaw put it this way: \"I do think, across the country, however, when they're looking at long-term unemployment, and they're looking at the uncertainty of the Obamacare, they're saying, 'You've got to move on, guys.'\" I'm all for moving on. The media can start up again if it discovers evidence Christie knew about the lane closures and then lied about it. But I'm also fond of self-awareness, especially from those of us in the media. So my message to Brokaw is: \"Newsman, heal thy own network.\" In the last couple of weeks, it has begun to look like NBC stands for \"Nothing But Christie.\" According to the conservative media watchdog site, Newsbusters, since the bridge story broke on January 8, NBC News has aired more than 25 full reports in less than 10 days. The angry liberal talk show hosts on MSNBC are even worse, droning on about the bridge story day after day in what is a blatant attempt to smear Christie. What do you suppose is more annoying? Being stuck in traffic for hours on a bridge -- or watching the media get stuck for days on a story about a juvenile stunt that might, or might not, bloom into a full-blown scandal? I'd have to go with the latter, especially when you consider that the media seem addicted to the story in hopes that it could somehow derail the plans of a Republican presidential hopeful. It's a long walk from one to the other, but see if you can follow me there. If Christie was in the loop, then he lied at his marathon press conference. If there is one thing that our friends in the Fourth Estate will not tolerate it's a liar. That is, at least not a Republican liar. That's part of the problem with this, the sense that a story about partisanship run amok is itself partisan in the way it's being covered. Left-leaning elements of the media are trying to blow it up into a scandal to help clear the way for the likely Democratic presidential nominee -- Hillary Clinton. The other problem is that too many Americans have quickly jumped to the wrong conclusion. No, not about whether Christie knew about the prank and conspired to inconvenience scores of New Jersey residents in order to bully a political opponent. I'm talking about the other conclusion -- the one about how being a bully is a negative trait in an elected official, and perhaps even enough to end a political career. Is that so? Who made that determination? Think back to the great leaders who helped define the last century -- from Teddy Roosevelt to Winston Churchill to Franklin D. Roosevelt to Harry Truman to Margaret Thatcher to Ronald Reagan. You had better believe that those people had moments when they acted like bullies. That's part of politics. Besides, it seems like just yesterday that presidential candidates like George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis were trying to stiffen their upper lips and overcome the so-called \"wimp factor.\" We Americans are a fickle bunch. America could use more strength on the world stage. We needn't push around other countries, but -- whether we're talking about China or Libya or North Korea -- we also need a president who won't let our country be pushed around either. Who's afraid of big, bad bullies? Voters aren't. They keep voting them into office -- perhaps in the hopes that they'll use their strength for good. I'm still not sure that Christie knows how to do that. Yet, if he aspires to greatness, and to be the kind of leader that helps define this century, he had better learn fast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.\n\nSummary: Tom Brokaw praises the media's extensive coverage of Chris Christie's bridge scandal, highlighting its importance in political discourse. Navarrette agrees, emphasizing the need for such scrutiny in uncovering potential presidential misconduct.",

A GP is being investigated amid claims he failed to diagnose a two-year-old with leukaemia and dismissed her symptoms as \u2018toddler bruising\u2019. Sarah Sargent, 31, took her daughter, Lacey, to the doctor when worrying bruises began appearing on her body. She claims Dr David Pelta didn\u2019t even get out of his chair during the brief 30 second check-up at Queensway Surgery in Southend, Essex. Lacey Sargent was diagnosed with leukaemia after developing bruising. But, when her mother first took her to the GP, she was sent away and told she had 'toddler bruising' She is pictured before her illness . She said he glanced over his desk, said it was \u2018toddler bruising\u2019 and there was nothing he could do and then sent them home. Two days later, Lacey\u2019s condition worsened and Mrs Sargent and her husband Stuart, 30, took their daughter back to see another GP at the surgery. This time, Dr Michael Jack immediately referred Lacey to Southend Hospital where she was diagnosed with leukaemia. In the seven months since, Lacey has had numerous blood transfusions and painful bone marrow tests and been forced to take chemotherapy tablets at home. But the family have finally had some good news after being told the treatment is working. It means Lacey has just one month left of taking medication before she is slowly weaned off the chemotherapy. Lacey's mother, Sarah, says Dr David Pelta just spent 30 seconds with her and that he did not check her over . NHS England IS investigating Dr Pelta who has voluntarily left the practice pending their report. Mrs Sargent, of Southend, Essex, said the GP should be permanently struck off. The mother-of-three said: \u2018I took Lacey to see him and he didn\u2019t even get out of his chair. He just peered over the table and said \u201cit\u2019s just toddler bruising\u201d. \u2018I just thought \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, I don\u2019t know\u201d so I left and made another appointment for blood tests in two weeks\u2019 time. \u2018The second doctor examined her four times and immediately admitted her to hospital. He knew what was wrong but didn\u2019t want to say. After months of chemotherapy, Lacey is now responding well to treatment and will soon be weaned off medication . \u2018When we found out it was awful. You just don\u2019t expect any of your children to come down with leukaemia.\u2019 She added: \u2018It has been horrible but she has been happy the whole way through and I\u2019m so proud of her. \u2018There is always a chance that it can come back which is extremely scary. I don\u2019t think I could go through it again. \u2018Now we want Dr Pelta struck off. We want to protect other families. You have to do your job properly and he didn\u2019t.\u2019 Mrs Sargent says she spoke about her concerns to a pharmacist before seeing Dr Pelta in August last year and they told her Lacey should have a blood test. Dr Pelta is also being investigated by the General Medical Council over separate allegations. He has been placed under a series of restrictions since November last year after concerns over his medical notes. He is one of four doctors who saw a 20-year-old before she died from heart failure. Jodie Fields\u2019 family have refused to accept an inquest ruling that she died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome and say her symptoms should have been picked up sooner. A GMC spokeswoman said: \u2018I can confirm that the GMC is investigating. \u2018Dr Pelta has restrictions on his practice while the investigation is on-going. They were imposed on October 17.\u2019 In a statement released by the Medical Protection Society, Dr Pelta, of Westcliff, Essex, said: \u2018While matters are being investigated, I voluntarily agreed not to attend the practice. \u2018I cannot comment while there is an investigation taking place.\u2019 Ian Stidston, director of commissioning for NHS England Essex, said he couldn\u2019t comment on individual cases. Fatigue and pale skin - this is because leukaemia can cause anaemia which makes a child feel weak, tired and light-headed. Infections and fever - children with leukaemia lack normal white blood cells which would normally help fight infection. Easy bruising or bleeding - this includes frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and bleeding a lot from small cuts. Bone or joint pain - this is caused by a build up of leukaemia cells near the surface of the bone or inside the joint. Swelling of the abdomen - leukaemia cells may collect in the liver and spleen causing them to enlarge. Loss of appetite and weight loss - if the spleen and liver swell, they can press against the stomach causing loss of appetite. Swollen lymph nodes - some leukaemias spread to the lymph nodes causing them to swell.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN)It could be billed as the billionaires' derby. A clash between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday signals the business end in this season's Europe's money-spinning Champions League competition has landed. Chelsea, a comfortable leader in the English Premier League, faces off against Paris Saint-Germain, which is in contention for a third successive league crown in France. Among its many intriguing plot lines is a battle between two of football's biggest egos: Chelsea's irascible, but eminently quotable, manager Jose Mourinho, and PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a walking well of self confidence. It also sees the London club's Russian owner Roman Abramovich put his expensively assembled side up against an equally star-studded Parisian outfit, which is owned by Qatar Sports Investments. Throw in a chance for PSG to avenge its elimination from last year's competition at the quarterfinal stage, and David Luiz meeting the side that sold him to the Paris club for a reported fee of $76 million in May, and it has all the makings of a classic. Who has the biggest ego out of Mourinho and Ibrahimovic? How long have you got? These two possess such magnetic personalities a simple televised conversation between them on CNN would probably attract an audience of millions. Of course, Mourinho is the man who arrived for his first spell at Chelsea after having guided Porto to the Champions League title and promptly informed the British press that he was \"a special one.\" A litany of trophies has followed in his subsequent stints at Italian club Inter Milan -- a haul that included another Champions League title -- and Spanish giants Real Madrid, but also a long charge sheet of controversy. As well as a series of spats with fellow managers, Mourinho famously poked then Barcelona assistant manager Tito Vilanova in the eye after a touchline melee -- this a few seasons after he charged onto the Camp Nou pitch to celebrate Inter's victory over Barca in a Champions League semifinal. Ibrahimovic is as good a match as any for Mourinho's ego in the game of soccer. Richly talented, and as enigmatic as they come, the Swede recently suggested a statue of him could replace the Eiffel Tower. His recent autobiography 'I Am Zlatan' was utterly self-aggrandizing and all the more entertaining for it, filled with hubris along the same lines as his response when asked what gift he would get his girlfriend for her birthday. \"Nothing,\" he replied. \"She already has Zlatan.\" He has played for a selection of the world's biggest clubs -- Juventus, Barcelona, Inter Milan, as well as AC Milan, and now PSG -- scoring spectacular goals wherever he has been. The Portuguese managed Ibrahimovic for just one solitary season when they were at Inter together, the latter saying in his book: \"Mourinho would become a guy I was basically willing to die for.\" At the end of the 2008/09 season, Inter having won Serie A for the third straight season and Ibrahimovic finishing as the league's top scorer with 25 goals, the Swede left for Barcelona in search of a Champions League crown. But it was Mourinho and Inter who won it the following season. Now the pair go head-to-head; Ibrahimovic is yet to win Europe's top club prize, Mourinho is gunning for his third. How rich are the clubs' respective owners? Mega-rich. Abramovich made his money from the controversial privatization of the Russian oil fields and is currently worth an estimated $9 billion, according to Forbes. After purchasing the club in 2003 Abramovich transformed them from also-ran into a major force with a series of lavish spending sprees on players, outlaying nearly $3bn in his first 10 years. Notoriously reticent, the 48-year-old has never offered any public statement or fluff piece on the club's website to explain any of his decisions, one of which was to hand Mourinho a huge payoff at the end of his first stint at the club. Though the Portuguese delivered a first English league title in over 50 years during his first season at the helm, it was the Champions League crown that Abramovich desperately craved. After running through a series of high-profile managers since, Chelsea's first ever European Cup was actually delivered by a caretaker manager and former player -- Roberto Di Matteo, who took over after Andre Villas-Boas was sacked after just nine months at the helm. Even after delivering the ultimate prize, Di Matteo himself lasted just three months the following season before he was dismissed by the Russian. Recently, Abramovich has curtailed his extravagant spending to ensure Chelsea complies with Financial Fair Play (FFP), a directive from European football's governing body that insists all clubs must live within its means. Chelsea have recouped around $215 million in recent seasons through player sales, a large chunk of which came through the sale of Luiz to PSG, and recorded a profit for the second successive year to the end of June 2014. Abramovich hasn't put the brakes on his own spending though, his $1bn super yacht a reminder of his vast personal wealth. There are many similarities between Abramovich and PSG's owners -- Qatar Sports Investments (QSI). It has vast reserves -- an estimated $200 billion -- and also craves a Champions League crown. It is being forced to curtail spending after being hit with a fine by UEFA for failing to meet the criteria set out by FFP. After QIS purchased 70% of the club in June 2011, and became the sole shareholder the following year, PSG was transformed into one of the world's richest clubs overnight. Like Abramovich, it invested heavily in the playing squad -- purchasing the likes of Javier Pastore and Ibrahimovic -- and was rewarded in 2013 with PSG's first league title for 19 years. Despite defending its French crown last season, success on the European scene continues to elude it. It has been knocked out at the last eight stage in the last two seasons, by Barcelona in 2012/13 and by Chelsea in 2013/14. Coach Laurent Blanc is presiding over an injury crisis at present but the tie with Chelsea could be the deciding factor as to whether he continues in his job beyond the end of the season. Who will be the key protagonists? Leaving aside the wealth of attacking options on display, there is one man who is certain to attract plenty of attention -- David Luiz. The Brazilian defender spent three years with Chelsea, and was part of the squad that won the Champions League in 2012, but turned down a new contract to join PSG for a fee of around $76 million. His defensive prowess was the focus of much attention in the Premier League, one pundit saying Luiz operated on the field as if he was being controlled by \"a 10-year-old on a PlayStation.\" Prone to abandoning his defensive station and pouring forward when deployed at the back, Mourinho moved the 27-year-old into midfield for the majority of last season. This two-legged tie could go either way for the Brazilian: either Luiz proves his former club made a mistake in letting him go with a barnstorming performance, or those trademark lapses in concentration will confirm the belief that Chelsea pulled off an outstanding piece of business. Luiz will be tasked with shackling Diego Costa, Chelsea's new striker who has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water, scoring 17 goals already to help the Londoners carve out a seven-point lead over Manchester City. Cesc Fabregas is the man who supplies most of Costa's goals after joining from Barcelona in June, while Mourinho has stiffened Chelsea's resolve in defense, veteran skipper John Terry key to its parsimonious nature. As for PSG, after two years of outright dominance in France, it is stuttering this season. Even before a crippling injury crisis recently took hold, it had been criticized for under performing and currently sits third in the table, behind Marseille and Lyon. Sunday's draw with Caen was a case in point. Leading 2-0 at halftime it lost four players to injury and having run out of substitutes, its nine men couldn't prevent slumping to a 2-2 draw. Ibrahimovic is still its talisman, and his striker partner Ezequiel Lavezzi will also be important in the absence of so many players. It is hoped Blaise Matuidi will recover in time to feature against Chelsea, while Marco Veratti will have to take on extra responsibility given its depleted ranks. What happened last time they met? Quite simply, PSG should have won. It secured a 3-1 lead in the first leg at the Parc des Princes after goals from Pastore and Lavezzi were added to a by a Luiz own goal. Chelsea took the lead in the return leg through Andre Schurrle -- recently sold to German club Wolfsburg -- but were struggling to conjure any chances as the game entered its final moments. But substitute Demba Ba popped up to bundle the ball home in the 87th minute to spark wild scenes of celebration at Stamford Bridge and send Mourinho sprinting down the touchline to pass on some tactical instructions in the aftermath. Chelsea would fall at the next stage, beaten 3-1 on aggregate by Spanish champions Atletico Madrid, which succumbed to city rivals Real in the final. This is Mourinho's fifth attempt at securing the Champions League crown for Chelsea, but will he succeed this year?\n\nSummary: Manchester United prepares to face Real Madrid in the Europa League quarterfinals on Wednesday.\nThe showdown features a rivalry between Manchester United's legendary coach Sir Alex Ferguson and Real's star forward Cristiano Ronaldo.\nManchester United is at the top of the La Liga standings, while Real Madrid is chasing its fourth consecutive title.\nBoth teams are supported by influential investors, with Manchester United owned by the American Glazer family and Real Madrid backed by the Spanish royal family.",

The 64-year-old was making reference to a scene from the film Fatal Attraction - in which a deranged woman kills her lover's daughter's pet rabbit. He went on: 'I strayed from my first love, Aerosmith, and I'm back - but instead of begging on my hands and knees, I've got two fists in the air and I'm kicking the door open with my band.' This means the fate of final judge Randy Jackson will no doubt hang in the balance, as rumours are rife that he may no longer be a judge, as Mariah Carey in 'serious talks' to sign on.

American scientists found the taller a post-menopausal woman is, the greater her risk of developing cancer . Tall women are more likely to get cancer, new research suggests. American scientists found the taller a post-menopausal woman is, the greater her risk of developing cancer. Yeshiva University research found that for every 10cm increase in height, there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer. The study, which revealed more cancers are associated with height than those linked to weight, has surprised scientists. Height was linked to cancers of the breast, colon, endometrium, kidney, ovary, rectum, and thyroid, as well as to multiple myeloma and melanoma. These associations did not change even after adjusting for factors known to influence these cancers, in the study of 20,928 post-menopausal women. Dr Geoffrey Kabat, senior epidemiologist of Yeshiva University, said: 'We were surprised at the number of cancer sites that were positively associated with height. 'In this data set, more cancers are associated with height than were associated with body mass index. 'Ultimately, cancer is a result of processes having to do with growth, so it makes sense that hormones or other growth factors that influence height may also influence cancer risk.' Dr Kabat said some genetic variations associated with height are also linked to cancer risk, but more studies are needed to better understand how these height-related genetic variations predispose some men and women to cancer. The scientists used data from a study that recruited post-menopausal women who were aged 50 to 79 between 1993 and 1998. At the start of the study, the women answered questions about physical activity and their height and weight were measured. Modern family actress Sofia Vergara (pictured) who is 1 metre 70 cms tall, beat thyroid cancer . The researchers identified 20,928 women who had been diagnosed with one or more invasive cancers during the follow-up period of 12 years. To study the effect of height, they accounted for many factors influencing cancers, including age, weight, education, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and hormone therapy. They found that for every 10 centimetre increase in height, there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer. Among specific cancers, there was a 13 to 17 per cent increase in the risk of getting melanoma and cancers of the breast, ovary, endometrium, and colon. Yeshiva University research found that for every 10cm increase in height, there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer. The study, which revealed more cancers are associated with height than those linked to weight, has surprised scientists . There was a 23 to 29 per cent increase in the risk of developing cancers of the kidney, rectum, thyroid, and blood. Of the 19 cancers studied, none showed a negative association with height. The scientists also examined the participants' mammography, Pap, and colorectal cancer screening histories, which could have swayed conclusions of the study, but found that the results remained unchanged. Dr Kabat said: 'The association of height with a number of cancer sites suggests that exposures in early life, including nutrition, play a role in influencing a person's risk of cancer. 'There is currently a great deal of interest in early-life events that influence health in adulthood and our study fits with this area.' The findings were published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.\n\nSummary: Researchers at Yeshiva University discovered a decrease in cancer risk with every 10cm increase in height for post-menopausal women, challenging previous beliefs that height was a factor in cancer development. The study, which found a stronger correlation between cancer and weight rather than height, has intrigued the scientific community.",

A grandmother has today spoken of her shock at finding a dead lizard wrapped in a cucumber she bought at Aldi. Jenny Wilkinson, 54, was about to chop up the vegetable and give it to her one-year-old grandson, Theo, when she spotted an unusual mark near the top. Upon further inspection, she realised the strange brown patch was a lizard that had been squashed in to the cucumber when it was vacuum-packed. Grandmother Jenny Wilkinson, 54, was about to chop up this Aldi cucumber when she noticed a strange brown mark (pictured). On closer inspection, she realised it was a lizard squashed in the packaging . Mrs Wilkinson, who was about to give the vegetable to her grandson Theo, one, says the creature must have got into the batch when the cucumbers were packaged in Holland . Mrs Wilkinson believes the small reptile must have got into the batch when the cucumbers were packaged in their country of origin - Holland. Horrified, the grandmother - who bought the 39p cucumber from a branch of Aldi in Cowes, Isle of Wight - wrote an email to the supermarket with photographs of the creature. She has since been given \u00a320 worth of vouchers as an apology. Mrs Wilkinson, a chocolate shop owner, said: 'I was looking after my grandson, Theo, for the day and I went to Aldi to get some shopping.

He was once a guru to\u00a0 environmentalists, claiming climate change would kill billions of humans by the end of this century. But it seems James Lovelock has had a change of heart. On the eve of a major environmental summit, he has attacked the modern green movement \u2013 declaring its theories 'meaningless drivel'. Almost half a century after he revealed his Gaia theory, which inspired a generation of activists, the former Nasa scientists said he believed that rising sea levels were not a problem and that wind turbines were 'useless'. The 92-year-old described the modern green movement as a 'religion', which used guilt to gain support. Speaking about climate change, he said: 'I'm not worried about sea-level rises.' He added: 'At worst, I think it will be 2ft a century.' Slamming environmentalists, he said: 'It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion. 'I don't think people have noticed that, but it's got all the sort of terms that religions use. The greens use guilt. You can't win people round by saying they are guilty for putting CO2 in the air.' Mr Lovelock said he was a firm supporter of nuclear power and even voiced his support for fracking \u2013 the controversial process of extracting gas from rock deep underground, opposed by the green movement. He said: 'Gas is almost a giveaway in the US at the moment. They've gone for fracking in a big way. 'Let's be pragmatic and sensible and get Britain to switch everything to methane. We should be going mad on it.' In an interview, Mr Lovelock . described existing theories of 'sustainable development' \u2013 a key topic . for discussion at the upcoming summit \u2013 as 'drivel'. He . suggested that humans should instead use air conditioning to deal with . climate change in cities, citing Singapore as an example. He . said: 'If we all move into cities, they become the equivalent of a . nest. Then another thought comes immediately from that: if that's the . way the flow is going, don't stop it, let's encourage it. 'Instead of trying to save the planet by geo-engineering or whatever, you merely have to air-condition the cities.' Speaking . about Singapore he said:\u00a0 'You could not have chosen a worse climate in . which to build a city. It's a swamp with temperatures in the 90s every . day, and very humid. Turnaround: Almost half a century after he revealed his Gaia theory, which inspired a generation of activists, the former Nasa scientists said he believed that rising sea levels were not a problem and that wind turbines were 'useless' 'But it is one of the most successful cities in the world. It's so much cheaper to air-condition the cities and let Gaia take care of the world. It's a much better route to go than so-called \u201csustainable development\u201d, which is meaningless drivel. Mr Lovelock, who has conducted research at Yale and Harvard universities, has been a respected member of the academic community for decades. He discovered the presence of harmful chemicals \u2013 CFCs \u2013 in the atmosphere in the 1960s. He developed the Gaia theory while working with Nasa. It claims that the Earth has a\u00a0 self-regulating system which has automatically controlled global temperature, atmospheric content, oxygen, ocean salinity, and other factors. But last month, the scientist admitted that he had been 'alarmist' and 'extrapolated too far' with his doomsday-like predictions on the effects of climate change. His latest comments came just a week before the Rio+20 summit, a major conference on climate change, to mark the anniversary of the landmark Earth Summit in 1992.

But when they got back to the UK they were arrested and the baby seized . A British couple \u2018fell under the spell\u2019 of Nigerian fraudsters who gave the woman herbal remedies and tricked her into thinking she had given birth, the High Court heard. The court was told how the husband and wife still cannot accept the baby girl they brought home from Nigeria two years ago is not their own \u2013 despite DNA tests proving they are not the natural parents. Social workers arrested the couple after they returned to the UK, accusing them of being knowing parties in the fraud. The court heard how the little girl is now \u2018effectively an orphan\u2019 with no prospect of ever learning who her real parents are \u2013 and faces growing up in the British care system. Now a judge has cleared the \u2018intelligent, educated, hard working\u2019 couple of any involvement in the scam, possibly paving the way for her to be returned to them. Family judge Mary Hogg told the court how for ten years the couple, who cannot be named, tried surgery, laser treatment and IVF to start a family \u2013 but to no avail. Then in 2010 the husband ran\u00a0 into a university friend who told him of a couple who had had twins after \u2018some herbal treatment\u2019\u00a0 in Nigeria. The desperate couple decided to travel to Africa, where they were prescribed a course of herbal remedies by a man calling himself Dr Cletus Okolo. After taking the herbs and returning to Britain, the woman\u2019s face, arms and abdomen swelled as if she was pregnant. Even a \u2018kindly and well-meaning\u2019 local GP accepted she was seven months\u2019 pregnant, and signed off a maternity certificate. The couple then returned to Nigeria for further treatment. Duped: The couple were told by a university friend to visit Dr Cletus Okolo in Nigeria's coastal city of Lagos where they were given herbs that made the mother swell up as if pregnant . At a clinic near the capital Lagos, they handed over \u00a34,500 and the woman was given a brown liquid to drink before entering what she thought was a delivery room. The man waited in the corridor outside and, after few minutes, he heard a baby cry. He entered the room to find the baby girl \u2013 referred to in court only as \u2018A\u2019 \u2013 lying on the bed beside his groggy wife. He was duped into believing he had seen the umbilical cord cut and was given a placenta in a plastic bag. After pocketing the couple\u2019s money, Dr Okolo wrote: \u2018Treatment successful, patient delivered of a baby girl. All fees paid. God\u2019s doing\u2019, which was the sole document that accompanied the birth. After returning home to the UK they were arrested and A was taken into police protection. To the couple\u2019s \u2018considerable dismay and shock\u2019, DNA tests proved that the girl was not their child. Cleared: Mrs Justice Hogg ruled the 'intelligent, educated, hard-working' couple were unaware of the scam . Having waited so long for a baby, the couple simply could not accept the truth, the court heard. Far from seeing themselves as victims, they insisted that \u2018the combination of spiritual and herbal treatments was so powerful as to be able to change DNA\u2019. But Mrs Justice Hogg said: \u2018There is no evidence before me to say that the result of the DNA testing was wrong or likely to be wrong. I do not accept the explanation of the parents. \u2018On that basis I have to accept the validity of the results and find that the baby is not the biological child of the putative parents.\u2019 Social workers in the London Borough of Hillingdon, as well as the child\u2019s court-appointed guardian, argued that the couple were \u2018knowing parties to an elaborate fraud and charade upon the British immigration authorities and now parties to an attempted fraud on the court\u2019. They claimed the couple\u2019s account of the birth was \u2018littered with inconsistency\u2019 and implausibly embellished. Mrs Justice Hogg conceded: \u2018At first blush, the immediate reaction of the ordinary man on the proverbial Clapham omnibus would no doubt be, \u201cDon\u2019t be daft, its a fraud, they knew it\u201d.\u2019 However, noting the \u2018enormous difficulty\u2019 the couple had had in conceiving a child, Mrs Justice Hogg took them at their word when they said they would \u2018never seek to buy a baby\u2019. She added: \u2018Despite their education and intelligence, they are struggling with the result of the DNA test. Both of them say they still believe that A is their natural child. \u2018In the end, having considered all the evidence... I am driven to conclude that in some way they allowed themselves to be duped by fraudsters. \u2018They so much wanted a baby... they allowed themselves to fall under the spell of the herbalists, believing what was said to the mother and acting faithfully upon the instructions given to them. \u2018Contrary to the submissions of the local authority and guardian I do not find that the parents were wilfully and knowingly involved with or parties to a wrongful removal of A from her mother, or that they cynically \u201cbought\u201d a baby.\u2019 The Royal Courts of Justice heard the little girl, named only as A during proceedings, could spend life in care . The judge concluded: \u2018What is clear to me, having found that she is not their biological child but the child of another mother and father, and having been removed from her mother very soon after her birth, is that A certainly is the victim of wrongdoing and illegality, and very possibly her mother as well. \u2018The fact remains that A is effectively an orphan. There is no one in this country who has parental responsibility for her and no information as to her birth, parentage or background.\u2019 Mrs Justice Hogg ordered a further hearing to decide where A\u2019s best interests lie. Her finding that the couple were innocent dupes could improve their chances of persuading the court that A should be returned to them.\n\nSummary: British couple spent 10 years trying surgery and IVF to conceive. Husband's former university classmate recommended herbal programme. Paid \u00a34,500 to Dr Cletus Okolo in Lagos, Nigeria, for bags of herbs. Mother's body swelled, London GP believed she was 7 months pregnant. Drugged during birth back in Lagos, and father shown fake umbilical cord. Arrested on return to UK with new baby and little documentation. DNA tests show not the parents but judge rules they were unaware.",

Daker was convicted on Friday of 11 counts of felony murder, burglary, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and attempted aggravated stalking, for the strangling death of Karmen Smith and the stabbing of Miss Smith's son, Nick, in 1995. Mrs Blatz and Mr Smith are determined to move past the tragedy that has haunted them for more than two decades, as she proudly proclaimed 'He has no power over me.' Scroll down for video . Tears: Just days after staring him down in court, Lottie Spencer Blatz has spoken out about the nightmare her life became after Waseem Daker killed her friend and her friend's son . Pain: Daker, left, was convicted on Friday of a list of 11 crimes he committed in 1995, which include the murder of Karmen Smith and the stabbing of Miss Smith's son, Nick, right . 'He didn't break me,' an emotional Mr Smith told 20/20. Daker was convicted of stabbing Mr Smith 18 times when he was just five years old. 'I just feel a little more free than I did before,' he added. Both Mrs Blatz and Mr Smith had to face Daker in court, as the criminal served as his own attorney, cross-examining his victims. Mrs Blatz said she didn't want to face him for the trial, but Mr Smith's courage inspired her. 'I just kept on thinking, that poor Nick has got to confront the man that stabbed him eighteen times, and murdered his mom,' she said. 'And if he\u2019s going to do it, I gotta be strong for him, to show him that we can do it.' Mrs Blatz said she struggled to come to terms with what transpired that tragic day. 'This is clearly something that I've held in for so long that only a few close, dear friends are aware of what I experienced at the hands of Waseem Daker,' she said, weeping. Hurt: Daker was convicted of stabbing Mr Smith 18 times when he was just five years old . Happier times: Karmen Smith is pictured with Nick in an undated family photo . During the trial, both Mr Smith and Mrs Blatz gave emotional testimony when questioned by Daker. At one point, Daker said Mrs Blatz's statements were inappropriate, to which she responded: 'It\u2019s really inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you\u2019re sitting here asking me questions, and I have to come back with you and answer your questions, that\u2019s hard for me!' 'He has no power over me.'Lottie Spencer Blatz . Mr Smith responded similarly when Daker confronted him about statements he made from his hospital bed after the attack, when he told police his mother's killer's eyes were blue. 'I was in the hospital and had gotten stabbed repeatedly by you, so I don\u2019t really think that that was a very good time to be asking a 5-year-old questions like that,' he said, looking Daker in the eye. The jury near Atlanta began . deliberating the decision shortly before 10 a.m. Friday and returned a . guilty verdict against Waseem Daker in less than five hours. The . 35-year-old was indicted on 11 counts, including malice and felony . murder, burglary, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated . battery and attempted aggravated stalking. Convicted: Daker served as his own attorney during his trial . Daker is charged in the October 23, 1995 killing of Karmen Smith in her Cobb County home. Daker killed Miss Smith and attacked her son because he was obsessed with Lottie Spencer Blatz, who lived upstairs from them, prosecutors said. Daker was convicted of stalking Mrs Blatz in 1996. Authorities had long suspected Daker but couldn't connect him to the slaying until new DNA testing linked him to Miss Smith's death in 2009. Daker did not react as the verdict against him was read, The Marietta Daily Journal reported. Emotional: Karmen Smith's son, Nick, pictured testifying in court during the trial, was stabbed multiple times during the 1995 attack, but survived .

But several of Miss Smith's relatives and friends showed relief, including Mrs Blatz and Nick Smith, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Both Mrs Blatz and Mr Smith had testified against Daker. Jurors asked the judge during deliberations for permission to replay a portion of taped telephone conversations that allegedly occurred between Daker and Mrs Blatz on October 13 and 14, about a week before the slaying, and a portion of a taped interview Daker had with Cobb County Police Detective Brad McIntyre after the slaying.

Jen Cordaro, who calls herself 'Jen the Archer', started a program several months ago to teach hunting and other outdoor pursuits to children that has attracted the anger of animal-rights activists in California . Cordaro's Facebook page, which includes photos of her and her young students in the field, has caught the attention of animal-rights activists, who want to stop all hunting in California . The hunting and angling enthusiast has received dozens of messages including: 'I would not let my children near such a vile, sadistic murderer as this piece of human trash.' Another post said: 'Give me 5 minutes in a room with her and I would make sure she feels the same pain and cruelty she dished out!' As well as angry comments on her social media pages, an online petition has been launched which calls Cordaro a murderer and demands that she stop hunting.

The Atlanta-based home retailer, which has more than 2,000 stores nationwide, says it has now eliminated the malware behind the attacks that took place between April and September. It said it has also completed a 'major' payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of customers' payment data in its U.S. stores. Scroll down for video . Breach: The retailer has said it has now \u00a0eliminated malware from its U.S. and Canadian networks that affected 56 million unique payment cards between April and September (file picture) In December, Target Corp. disclosed a massive data breach that was the second-largest in history, resulting in the theft of 40 million debit and credit card numbers and the potential exposure of personal information of up to 70 million shoppers. According to the Federal Trade Commission, one of the only ways customers can see if you have been hit by the hack is by checking  bank statements for irregularities. You can also initiate a credit freeze - also known as a security freeze - which limits the access you have to credit reports, meaning hackers have less of an opportunity to open accounts in your name. In response to the breach, Home Depot is offering a year's coverage through identity theft protection programs - AllClear ID and AllClear PRO. It says that service is free. In order to protect yourself in the future, experts have suggested signing up to annualcreditreport.com. The service allows individuals to check if there has been any fraudulent activity on the account on a yearly basis. There are also more simple methods such as using different passwords for different accounts and primarily using credit cards for transactions - because they have better identity protection. Home Depot is believed to have been hit by the same\u00a0malicious software program that stole card account data from cash registers at Target. Retailers, banks and card companies have responded to the breaches by speeding the adoption of microchips in U.S. credit and debit cards - a technology that helps makes transactions more secure. The U.S. is one of the only countries in the world to still use magnetic strips - one of the least safe ways of making a transaction - ahead of chip-based methods of payment. According to Krebs on Security, the hack focused on the self-service lanes at the stores. A source close to the investigation told the site that an analysis revealed  some of Home Depot's store registers had been infected with a new variant of 'BlackPOS' - also known as 'Kaptoxa'. It is a strain of malware designed to siphon data from cards when they are swiped at infected point-of-sale systems running Microsoft Windows. To try and combat this, Home Depot has announced that it plans to have chip-enabled checkout terminals at all of its U.S. stores by the end of this year. The store has also confirmed its sales-growth estimates for the fiscal year and expects to earn $4.54 per share in fiscal 2014, up 2 cents from its prior guidance. Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said in a statement: 'We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused, and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges. 'From the time this investigation began, our guiding principle has been to put our customers first, and we will continue to do so.' Target point: Sources close to the investigation believe that the malware was installed in the self-service checkout lanes (file picture) Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n\nSummary: Retailer says it has now eliminated the malware behind the cyberattacks.\nSays it also completed a 'major' payment security project to protect data.\nIs believed to have been the same malicious software that hit Target last year.\nHackers are believed to have targeted the in-store self-service checkouts.",

UPDATED: . 04:53 EST, 16 December 2013 . People who live near airports should pay less tax for \u2018tolerating\u2019 high levels of noise, a new report suggests. The Institute of Economic Affairs argues that the area around runways could become \u2018tax havens\u2019 for local residents with public services paid for through taxes on airport operators. The radical idea emerged ahead of tomorrow\u2019s publication of an interim report by Sir Howard Davies into airport expansion in the South East . Noise: People who live near airports should pay less tax as compensation for the disruption caused by flights, the IEA said . The IEA says there must be a \u2018more decentralised tax system\u2019 which would ensure that revenue \u2018generated at and around an airport stays in the local area\u2019 instead of being taken by the Treasury. The report adds: \u2018The surroundings of large airports could then become \u201ctax havens\u201d: airports would account for a large share of the local tax revenue, so residents could enjoy both low taxes and excellent local public services/infrastructure. \u2018Localism cannot be meaningfully separated from fiscal autonomy at the local level. The local level should have the right to keep most of the locally generated tax revenue. \u2018But the logical correlate of that right is that areas which permit a high level of economic activity . are no longer obliged to share their revenue with areas that do not. \u2018In a decentralised system, the vicinities of airports would become \u2018tax havens\u2019. It is often claimed that high tax rates are the necessary price to pay for high-quality infrastructure and public services, because there is no way to combine \u2018Swedish social services with Singaporean tax rates\u2019. Sir Howard Davies, who is running a commission into airport expansion for the government . \u2018That claim is wrong. In a localised system, areas with sufficiently high levels of airport activity could achieve precisely that. There is no free lunch, but residents in those areas would \u2018pay\u2019 by tolerating high noise levels. That is a near-market solution for economic progress that benefits all sides.\u2019 The Davies Commission is expected to say that new runways are Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick should all be considered. But an increase in flights will be viciously opposed by people living nearby. Before the last election the Tories vowed not to expand Heathrow, with Justine Greening, now the International Development Secretary, leading a campaign against a third runway. London Mayor Boris Johnson is also opposed to the idea of expanding Heathrow, warning it would be \u2018environmentally disastrous and wrong for the country\u2019. But some senior Conservatives now believe it is the only realistic option to provide the extra capacity needed to attract investment in the UK. The IEA argues that those in favour of airport expansion also need to make the case for allowing more families to go on holiday. \u2018Supporters of airport expansion should stop hiding behind an instrumental defence of aviation, and openly make the case for air travel as a leisure industry, its report adds. \u2018They should confront the mindset of \u2018Malthusian miserabilism\u2019 which characterises modern environmentalism. \u2018Environmentalists have become the latter-day heirs of the Duke of Wellington, who opposed railway travel on the grounds that it would \u201conly encourage the lower classes to move about needlessly\u201d.\u2019\n\nSummary: Institute for Economic Affairs says local residents should be compensated.\nMoney generated in and around airports should stay in the local area.\nAttacks green 'miserabilism' against allowing families to go on holiday.\nComes ahead of interim report into airport expansion in the South East.",

In every pair of siblings there is always a good one and a bad one, and it seems the same is true of bear cubs. Wildlife photographer Greg Harvey, 43, captured one male brown bear cub picking on his sister while he was on a visit to Alaska. Mr Harvey, who lives in Alberta, Canada, says: 'I could see the male tormenting the female every chance he got. How rude: A male brown bear cub appears to stick his tongue out at his sister after the pair were pictured play fighting with each other in Alaska . Wildlife photographer Greg Harvey, 43, said the male cub kept picking on his sister, and even bit her on the backside after chasing her . Mr Harvey said the female cub was rarely the aggressor and even ran to her mother for safety after her brother kept on biting her . 'While she held her own, she was rarely the aggressor and from time to time would get mad at her brother and would try to hide  by cuddling  her mom.' 'When she had enough she tried to run away, but the little boy wasn't having any of that. He chased after her and bit her on the bum.' The brown bear cubs are only 15-months-old and eager to play with each other; however it seems the brother bear often takes it a little too far. Mr Harvey estimates that the two cubs were only 15 months old when he photographed them in 2011, and were still keen on playing together . The misbehaving male brown bear climbs on the back of his long-suffering sister in Alaska as\u00a0photographer Greg Harvey captured images . Mr Harvey said he likes anthropomorphic images, in which the animals seem to be carrying out human actions suck as sticking their tongues out . Mr Harvey, a self-taught photographer, said: 'The funny thing about anthropomorphism is it can happen at any time. People often ask about the story behind the images. Truthfully, the stories of any interest are normally what happens behind the scenes in a strange country. 'A brown bear cub wets his lips or tastes the air, and it looks like he is sticking his tongue out at his sister because of her body language as she cuddles up to her mom. I enjoy anthropomorphic images and am over the moon when I am lucky enough to acquire these kinds of images.' The photographer explained that many of his colleagues are in the field taking pictures up to 200 days per year. He added: 'I have to find a way to compete with them with only 14 days on safari per year.' Unlike many of his colleagues who can spend up to 200 days in the field every year, Mr Harvey only spends 14 days on safari . While these young bear cubs are small, they will eventually weigh up to 700lbs as adults, eat up to 90lb of food each day and measure up to 8ft long . A brown bear cub dries off while being watched by its sibling in Alaska where photographer Greg Harvey captured images of the pair playing together .\n\nSummary: A pair of young grizzly bear siblings were observed engaging in a fierce battle for dominance in Alberta, Canada, as documented by seasoned wildlife photographer Greg Harvey. The aggressive male cub was seen consistently overpowering his sister, leading to a rare display of bear cub rivalry. Harvey noted the unusual intensity of the confrontation, with the female cub ultimately seeking refuge with her father.",

The car was a 21st birthday present from Queen Elizabeth, and the prince has converted it to run on 100 percent bioethanol as a way to reduce his carbon emissions, his office, Clarence House, said. The prince has also converted his other cars -- several Jaguars, an Audi and a Range Rover -- to run on 100 percent biodiesel fuel made from used cooking oil, his office added. Details of the prince's biofuel use were made public Monday in his household's 2008 Annual Review, which details the prince's income and activities over the past year.

A man is accused of stealing a tow truck to steal back his two vehicles from an impound lot before leading police on a chase. Timothy Zeman, 51, from Pacific, Missouri was accused of stealing a flatbed truck yesterday from Hyndrich Brothers Towing and then used it to retrieve his previously impounded cars from a different lot in Jefferson County. He was chased by both sheriff's deputies and Missouri Highway Patrol before being arrested after driving into a bluff, said police. Zeman has been charged with first-degree tampering and felony resisting arrest, and is being held in the Franklin County jail on a $50,000 bond, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Deputies were able to determine the two cars being towed on the stolen wrecker belonged to Zeman - and believe he took them from the impound lot with the truck. Zeman is said to have broken into the tow yard overnight. He was seen by a deputy on Sunday who was traveling on Highway O, and spotted a tow truck matching the description of the missing wrecker reported in a call to the sheriff's office at 7am.

The Sharps say they live by the motto, \"The money that's made in the company ... stays in the company.\" The arena is the future home of the NBA's Orlando Magic. It will seat more than 18,000 fans when it opens next year. The only seats John Sharp Jr. is concerned about, though, are the ones in the 42 portable toilets he placed on this job site. When you work five stories high, a nearby toilet can be your best friend. But for Sharp's company, Comfort House, business isn't exactly, um, flowing like it did before the recession. \"We had 98 percent of our inventory out, with strong healthy prices,\" he told CNN. \"With the boom in the production homes, that's what kept us busy.\" The arena is one of the biggest projects in Florida with more than 400 construction workers on site. But the decline in construction, which was 95 percent of Comfort House's business, hit the company hard. It's been forced to lay off about a third of its staff, including some long-time employees. Hours have been cut back as well. Now a sea of toilets sits unrented on the company's property. But it's not a sign of desperation, Sharp said. \"We didn't take on a large amount of debt. We paid cash for our assets,\" he said. The company owns its property outright, including all its portable toilets, vehicles and equipment. That's part of the business model Sharp said his parents taught him, and it's helped this family business survive and ward off bottom feeders who see the toilets sitting unused and think he's desperate to be bought out at a fraction of the cost. \"Had we spent outside our means, had we grown and leveraged everything, financed everything, we'd be in a really tough situation,\" he said. \"Good business model: Storing money, saving money when you make money ... keeping things simple.\"  Watch Sharp discuss the recession's effect on his business \u00bb . Comfort House is a third-generation family business that started in the late 1960s. John Sharp Sr., the family patriarch, said he's acquired considerable wisdom from the three previous recessions that he and his company have survived. \"My boat is a 12-foot johnboat we use for duck hunting, and that's my yacht, and that's pretty much the extent of my extravagance,\" he told CNN. \"So we kind of live by that motto that the money that's made in the company kinda stays in the company,\" he said. But every company has its breaking point, and even with sound business principles and mechanics, the Sharps say, it's hard to tell how long they can last. This recession is by far the worst that the elder Sharp has seen. \"You don't know when it's gonna end,\" he explained. \"If you could tell me it's gonna end in six months, I could say, 'OK, here's my business plan,' but our business plan is that this could go on for another year or two,\" he said. In many ways his son is getting a real-world crash course in \"Recession 101.\" \"It's been a great learning lesson for me ... I'm very fortunate ... because this will carry me, hopefully, for the next 30 years plus,\" he said. And while the Sharps are involved in a business that smells like anything but roses, John Sharp Jr. says as long as his toilets stay rented, they all smell like money. CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Portable toilet business hit hard by recession, decline in construction.\nFlorida-based family firm forced to lay off about a third of its staff, cut hours.\nCompany owns its property outright, including all of its portable toilets, vehicles.\nBusiness model has helped company survive and ward off would-be buyers.",

That type of exchange happens hundreds, maybe thousands, of times at this conference, which opened Friday in Chicago. The chance to meet online connections in person is part of the reason women from all over the world gather for the two-day event. They also come to network, build potential business partnerships and burnish their brands overall. \"Well Connected Mom\" Lori Cunningham expects to meet at least 200 people this year, her third BlogHer conference. She'll contact many of them when she returns home to continue networking and building upon common interests. \"It just is an opportunity to open a door that you wouldn't have if you didn't come to a BlogHer conference,\" said Cunningham, a mother of two from Los Angeles whose blog focuses on simplifying technology for women. For first-time BlogHer attendees like Chicagoan Jamie Jensen, the goal is to build her blog, For Love of Cupcakes, into a full-time job that she can run as a \"work-at-home mom.\" \"I'm hoping to just keep growing to where it can be a part-time income or eventually a full-time income,\" said Jensen, the mother of a 2-year-old girl, who works outside the home as a day-care teacher. BlogHer is more than a conference. It's also a major cross-platform business that hosts 3,000 blogs and helps many more expand their reach through education and networking opportunities. The BlogHer publishing network has generated $25 million for about 5,000 female writers over the past four years, said BlogHer co-founder Lisa Stone. Most bloggers use this income to support their work and pay for business expenses; others use it to supplement their household income and support their families, she said. Businesses understand the power of female bloggers, judging by the more than 130 brands -- from Coca-Cola to Samsung -- in attendance. And yet, mainstream media seem to marginalize what these women are doing. Take a Wall Street Journal story this year that depicted blogger conferences as opportunities for women to party away from their husbands and kids. \"The sheer power of women on the Web is so clear statistically, and yet there is some ongoing prevailing effort to belittle that leadership,\" Stone said, citing stats showing women are 41% more likely to use social media than men. \"Good luck trying to put women who blog into a bell jar,\" Stone said. \"They are going to ooze right out over the top and explode right in your face.\" Still, among the public, there seems to be a lack of understanding of what a blogger is, says Amanda Rodriguez, a mom of three boys and host of Dude Mom. Rodriguez, who is speaking on a panel this weekend, said she recently attended an event sponsored by the National Football League where no one seemed to understand what she did as a blogger. It's the same response she says she gets when she reveals her profession to people at airports or in the doctor's office. \"I think there's just a misconception about what bloggers do. They all think we're either like Perez Hilton or whatever random mommy blogger that they have read about on Oprah.com,\" the Frederick, Maryland, mom said. \"So I think it's up to us to sort of work really hard to change that perception,\" she said. \"Hopefully other people will start to give the career a little more credence.\" The BlogHer Conference, now in its ninth year and profiled recently in USA Today, aims to help by bringing attention to what female bloggers do. Big-name speakers also help. Last year, President Obama gave a keynote via video conference. This year's closing keynote speaker is Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook and author of the much-talked-about book \"Lean In.\" Mainstream America may not understand the power and influence of bloggers. But parents who share tips about products or advice for getting kids to behave see the blog community as an extension of those support networks, said Cunningham. There is another power that has nothing to do with educating the public. It has to do with women connecting with other women in ways they can't connect with their friends. First-time conference attendee Sarah Evans hosts the blog It's a Vol, based on her love of the University of Tennessee Volunteers. She suffered from postpartum depression after her daughter was born. The women she met online, many of whom she is meeting for the first time at BlogHer, saved her, she says. \"When I had postpartum depression, there was nobody in my physical life at that point in time who could say 'I know what you went through,' \" Evans said. Through the BlogHer community, she met others who could relate to what she was going through and shared their experiences on their blogs. \"You can say, 'Look at this mother. She's fantastic. She made her way through this,' \" she said. \"I feel like that right now, and I can get through that. I can get to that point, too.\" The value of such a connection? Priceless.\n\nSummary: Male bloggers from across the United States convene in New York for a week-long summit focused on advancing technology in blogging. The event emphasizes the importance of male leadership in the digital space, with keynotes from industry giants. \"It's crucial we redefine the blogger stereotype,\" stated TechDad blogger Jason Miller.",

Situated in the Outback, it is close to nothing: The cities of Adelaide and Alice Springs are respectively nine hours south and eight hours north, and the nearest town -- William Creek, official population three -- takes 3\u00c2\u00bd hours to reach, provided the dirt roads aren't closed due to rain. Here, the earth is red, vegetation bare and temperatures extreme, but none of that stopped Westerners from setting up camp a century ago when they found opal shimmering in the dirt. Lots of opal. So they began digging, in more ways than one. As they mined the earth to discover one of the world's richest gem deposits, they also discovered why Westerners didn't settle in this barren, desolate region of Australia before: The heat. To battle temperatures that regularly reached above 110, settlers dug underground dwellings, a practice that continues to this day. In the heat of day, people are nowhere to be found, each hidden in a mine or dugout. One sees why outlaws chose to come here: It's far from anything, it's desolate, it's pockmarked with underground homes, and it offers the possibility of a fresh start and the hope of a fortune. Walking down the town's main drag today makes one feel like a real-life space cowboy and evokes an episode of \"Firefly.\" There's a reconstructed \"Star Wars\" spaceship, underground hotels, a Volkswagon beetle painted like an opal dangling from a store, signs for underground churches, a kangaroo orphanage, a couple of mining museums, underground home tours, and a pizza place that sells pies with toppings like kangaroo, emu sausage, sweet cranberry, asparagus, onions and Camembert. Its residents are known for being eccentric and hearty -- and if some are outlaws, they don't publicize it much on the street. What they do publicize is the town's international community, which represents more than 50 countries. There are olive groves for the Italians and Greeks, a Chinese restaurant so Asians can taste home and grocery stores with fare ranging from sweet chili sauce to imported Greek fondant and a whole kangaroo tail, complete with fur. All in a town of 1,900. Coober Pedy remains a popular tourist destination for those seeking an authentic Outback experience (or who want to see where films like \"Red Planet,\" \"Mad Max\" and \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" were filmed). Visitors often walk through the graveyard, where several tombstones are decorated with colored lights, and one even has, \"Have a drink on me,\" etched into it, with beer and wine bottles resting nearby, free of charge. They board a four-wheel drive mail truck for a 13-hour tour of Outback cattle stations and towns. And, of course, they sit on the hot, dusty earth, shooing away oddly persistent flies as they lose all sense of time searching for opal in the dirt, hoping that the next stone they turn might let them retire early. Outlaws came to Coober Pedy a century ago to find their fortune. Today, the town is an international community of residents united by their commitment to mining one of the world's most precious gems. Just as the town is home to the kind of diversity found in many cities, the opal that miners find so alluring, seductive, even, is a gem of many colors, with specks of pink, green, blue and red. It's a singular, unique, precious stone, and like Coober Pedy itself, what makes it so valuable is the rainbow inside. IF YOU GO . What to do .

Leverkusen went into the match in second place on goal difference ahead of Mainz, but paid the price for poor second-half defending as Dortmund made the perfect start following the Bundesliga's mid-winter break. Two goals from Kevin Grosskreutz and another from teenager Mario Gotze gave Jurgen Klopp's team a ninth victory in 10 away trips and 15 from 18 matches overall, in front of a stunned sellout crowd of 30,210 at the BayArena. \"I have been going to watch Dortmund since 1994 and I know what it's like to win the league title as a fan on the terraces,\" Grosskreutz said of his team's hopes of a first championship since 2002. \"I have been dreaming of this since I was a little boy, and I'd love to hold the cup in my hands.\" Dortmund hit the post early in the first half with a header by Sven Bender, but Leverkusen slowly got into the game despite leaving veteran Germany international Michael Ballack on the substitutes' bench. However, Grosskreutz broke the deadlock four minutes after the break when Leverkusen defender Manuel Friedrich failed to deal with a long throw by Lukasz Piszczek and actually diverted the ball into the midfielder's path with his arm. Grosskreutz then made it 2-0 in the 53rd minute after Poland striker Robert Lewandowski headed on a long clearance as the home defense was again caught out. The 18-year-old Gotze, who made his international debut for Germany last year, then effectively ended the match two minutes later as he calmly slotted the ball through the legs of Leverkusen keeper Rene Adler for his fifth goal this season after being set free by Grosskreutz. It was Gotze's last significant contribution as he was replaced by top scorer Lucas Barrios, who forced a fine save from Adler in the 70th minute. Stefan Kiessling finally pulled one back for Leverkusen with 10 minutes to play as he bravely poked in a cross by Renato Augusto before colliding with the goal-post. The striker had another chance soon after, but shot wide as Leverkusen dropped down to third place. In Saturday's fixtures, Mainz travel to Stuttgart while fifth-placed defending champions Bayern Munich will try to reduce a 17-point deficit on Dortmund with victory at Wolfsburg.\n\nSummary: Kevin Grosskreutz scores twice as Borussia Dortmund extend Bundesliga lead.\nHe also sets up third goal for Mario Gotze in 3-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen.\nLeverkusen fall 13 points behind and drop to third place on goal difference.\nDortmund, seeking first German league title since 2002, have 15 wins from 18 matches.",

There were dramatic scenes in court last night as the judge declared a mistrial over the sentencing of Jodi Arias after the jury failed to reach a unanimous . verdict over whether or not she should be executed for . murdering her ex-boyfriend. The jury was dismissed from the courtroom after spending five months on the case, and while they did decide that she was guilty of the premeditated murder of Travis Alexander, they could not decide whether she should spend life in prison or be put to death. The next step in the lengthy trial will now come on July 18, when an entirely new jury panel is determined and tasked with delivering the final verdict in the case. In tears: Jodi Arias looked frightened before the jury's non-decision was handed down, but her composure did not change dramatically after she realized that she was not being sentenced to death . Heartbroken: Travis Alexander's relatives, including his sister Tanisha (right) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months . The scene in the Phoenix, Arizona courtroom on Thursday afternoon- when the jury came back to the judge with their inability to agree- was not one of relief. Arias herself looked upset and began crying, though not necessarily tears of joy. Alexander's siblings, who have been a constant presence throughout and have all uprooted their lives in California to focus on the trial, were all crying as well. One female juror was at least sympathetic to them, and she was seen mouthing the word 'sorry' toward the Alexanders. Judge Sherry Stephens, who showed some tough love to the jury yesterday, was very complimentary to them today. 'This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform some very difficult duties,' she said. Mistrial: Jody Arias reacts as the jury indicates it has not been able to reach a decision on the death penalty . The jury began deliberating Tuesday, and on Wednesday afternoon they told the Judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. She ordered the jurors . to go back and talk more until they came to a decision, but that was still not enough time as they came back later yesterday afternoon still at an impasse. The new jury will not have any power . to change her guilty conviction, and they will be solely tasked with . determining how she will 'pay' for the first degree murder. The . decision follows a trial that has staggered on for five months over the . 2008 slaying of Travis Alexander, Arias' on-again off-again boyfriend . who she killed in his home in 2008. She stabbed him nearly 30 times, . slit his throat, and shot him. Fearful: Arias was surrounded by her legal team, and her relatives were not in the room though they had been regularly fixtures at the trial through much of the five months . Even . for the most fastidious of court followers who have developed a sense . of who Arias is over the past five months of the trial, her behavior in . the past week has been confusing as she gave conflicting statements . about her desire thoughts on a possible death sentence. Immediately after her guilty verdict . was handed down two weeks ago, she granted a local news station an . interview where she said that she was 'in shock' and that she would . rather be given the death penalty as opposed to a life sentence in . prison. Speaking to the local Fox affiliate KSAZ, Arias said that she would 'prefer to die sooner than later.' \u2018Longevity . runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural . life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and I'll probably . live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward . to. 'I believe death is the ultimate freedom and I'd rather have my freedom as soon as I can get it.' Waiting game: Now the next jury will be impaneled on July 18 and this second portion of the trial- where the jury needs to determine the punishment for Arias- will be done for a second time . Those . comments prompted courthouse officials to order that she be placed in a . psychological hold and on suicide watch, which inevitably delayed the . second portion of the sentencing- where jurors were forced to decide if . the murder was especially aggressive. During the ensuing testimony, called . the aggravation portion of the trial, jurors heard from both sides who . were able to call witnesses arguing that she should and shouldn't be . forced to die, respectively. When . she addressed the court in her own defense, she she pledged, if allowed . to live, to donate her hair to cancer patients and start a prison . recycling program. 'I have . made many public statements that I would prefer the death penalty to . life in prison,' Arias told jurors. In each of those cases, 'I lacked . perspective,' she said. 'Until . very recently I could not imagine standing before you all and asking . for you to give me life,' she said. 'But as I stand here now I cannot in . good conscience ask you to sentence me to death.'\n\nSummary: Jodi Arias was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, as the jury reached a unanimous decision after a five-month trial.

UPDATED: . 14:52 EST, 21 July 2013 . Phil Mickelson has won his first British Open Championship. Five weeks after finishing runner-up at the US Open for the sixth time, Mickelson came from behind Sunday to win the Open, his fifth career major. The path to one of his greatest victories was longer than most, but Mickelson feels it's the greatest win of his career. Embraced by his family near the 18th hole, Mickelson celebrated the win after coming from two shots behind leader Justin Rose by shooting a week-best round of 66 at Muirfield. Fitting: Phil Mickelson is the winner of the 142nd Open Championship . Overcome: Phil Mickelson of the U.S. holds the Claret Jug as he celebrates with his wife Amy, and children Amanda, Sophia and Evan, after winning the British Open . Mickelson, 43, fended off late challenges from several golfers to clinch the title in front of his wife Amy and children, Amanda, Evan and Sophia. The world's number two golfer, Mickelson has famously battled through much adversity during his career. The British Open champ announced in 2010 that he had been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. Though treatable, the condition can create severe pain in the feet and tendinitis in the Achilles tendon, among other issues. He has said that his case is manageable. Healthy again: Amy Mickelson famously battled breast cancer in 2009, only a month before husband Phil's mother was also diagnosed . 'What a fun day. This is some of the best golf I have ever played,' said Mickelson. Mickelson's last major came at the 2010 Masters, which he also won in 2006 and 2004. His other major was the 2005 PGA Championship. Champ at last: Phil Mickelson holds the Claret Jug and hugs his wife Amy (L) in a family shot after winning the British Open Golf Championship . In May 2009, Mickelson announced that he would take a leave of absence from professional golf after his wife Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer. His leave of absence was to be indefinite, pending the outcome of Amy's treatment. Mickelson missed two tournaments while his wife underwent surgery and treatments. Pro golfers banded together wearing pink as a show of support for Mickelson's family. When told less than two weeks later that the surgery and ensuing treatment had been successful after doctors caught the cancer at an early stage, Mickelson announced he would return to pro golf. Moment with the family: Mickelson won the 142nd Open Championship at Muirfield . Less than a month later, Mickelson's mother Mary was diagnosed with breast cancer, causing him to take another leave of absence. He returned after she began to show improvement, but not without a nod to the man who saved the lives of the two most important women in his life. Mickelson invited Tom Buchholz, the radiation oncologist who treated both women,to be his caddy during the 2010 Houston Open after learning the man was a tour caddy in 1984, and then again during an exclusive Par 3 tournament at Augusta National the day before the 2012 Masters Championship, according to CultureMap Houston. Relief: Mickelson is hugged by wife Amy and children Amanda, Evan and Sophia . 'Playing this championship was the . biggest challenge of my career and I didn't know if I had the skills to . win on links golf but I played some of the best links golf I have ever . played,' Mickelson said after the tournament. 'It is amazing to be part of any Open Championship and to win at Muirfield feels amazing... this is probably the greatest and most difficult win of my career.' Mickelson's British Open victory came only weeks after he finished second at the U.S. Open for the sixth time, a defeat he called as difficult as any he's dealt with in his career. 'I have such an incredible difference of emotions from where I was a month ago with such a heart-breaking loss at the US Open,' Mickelson said. Frustration? Woods rarely appeared inspired . Tiger Woods made a late charge towards the front of the pack Sunday, but the world's number one golfer came up short, finishing tied for sixth overall.\n\nSummary: After overcoming his own diagnosis of breast cancer and a challenging start, Mickelson secured his first victory at the British Open, coming from behind to defeat Tiger Woods, who led the tournament until the final day.",

Vice President Joe Biden draped the purple and yellow striped ribbons around the necks of 20 public safety officers, and presented medals to the families of two officers killed while responding to armed robberies. The two were off-duty at the time. 'You're a rare breed,' Biden said. 'You're all crazy. We love you for it. We need you. You are the best thing we have going for us.' Scroll down for video .

Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder, left, award the Medal of Valor to former Chief John Curley, from the Bellmore, New York Fire Department . Two people were dead on the ground outside the Sikh Temple in August 2012 when Lt. Brian Murphy and Officer Savan Lenda of the Oak Creek Police Department arrived on scene. The suspected gunman was fleeing. Murphy pulled his gun, but the suspect fired first, hitting Murphy in his throat, legs and hand. When Lenda arrived on the scene and shot the suspect, the shooter crawled out of view and killed himself. Lenda sent fellow officers to help Murphy, but the lieutenant waved them away and insisted they help those still inside the temple. The White House said the two officers' actions helped save the lives of many. Boston and the surrounding area were in a state of panic in April 2013 because the suspects in the marathon bombing remained at large.

The fateful night when Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev carjacked a vehicle before a dramatic confrontation with police is well known. Less well known were the contributions of seven officers and firefighters from Watertown, Massachusetts, who received the medal from Biden. Despite heavy weapon gunfire and reports the brothers were throwing explosives, officers and firefighters who responded helped protect the lives of those in uniform, the White House said. Tamerlan died as a result of the incident; Dzhokhar was apprehended 20 hours later. Attorney General Eric Holder said this year's medals were particularly poignant, given that the country is struggling with 'deep challenges' in the relationship between law enforcement agencies and their communities. 'Beyond these honors, America owes you a debt that must be repaid not just with words but with actions,' Holder said. The Medal of Valor is the nation's highest honor for public safety officers who risk their own safety to save or protect others. This year's ceremony honored individuals who committed acts of valor between 2011 and 2013. Vice President Joe Biden, flanked by Attorney General Eric Holder, left, and Rep.

And President Roosevelt is said to have found it so funny that he had one on his desk, according to Johnson Smith & Co's Mammoth Catalog Of 5,000 Novelties. This novelty Hitler pin cushion was sold in the U.S. during the 1940s for 69 cents . Some of the figurines come with a comedy tag - and the novelties can sell for over $430 . The blurb from Johnson Smith & Co's Mammoth Catalog Of 5,000 Novelties from 1944 read: 'It's a safe place to store pins and needles... and will probably be the only useful thing Adolf Shickelgruber [his father's original surname] did' The novelty mail order company's blurb reads: 'It's a safe place to store pins . and needles... and will probably be the only useful thing Adolf .

The first \u2018environmental\u2019 speed limit is set to be imposed within months on a 32-mile stretch of the M1 \u2013 for seven days a week, from 7am to 7pm . The limit will be in place for several years, and any driver caught breaking it faces a hefty fine and penalty points on their licence. 'Green' scheme: A 60mph speed limit will be imposed within months on a 32-mile stretch of the M1 (pictured). It will be enforced from junction 28, near Matlock, Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham, Yorkshire . The Highways Agency said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway, and is \u2018not ruled out\u2019 on up to a dozen major routes. A busy stretch of the M3 near London is among those currently being assessed for anti-pollution measures. Motoring groups said it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty. And the restricted route will still be subject to variable speed limits to keep traffic flowing during congested periods, leading to regular caps of 50mph or 40mph. Traffic build-up: The M1 (pictured), which runs from London to Leeds, is one of the country's busiest motorways . The Highways Agency admitted it will be the first time a motorway speed limit has been cut on environmental rather than safety grounds, but insisted the plan was backed by ministers. The limit will be enforced on the M1 from junction 28, near Matlock, Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Motorists will be able to drive at the standard 70mph on the rest of the M1, which runs from London to Leeds. Criticism: AA President Edmund King has slammed the scheme - saying it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty . The restriction will apply from 7am to 7pm seven days a week and be enforced by speed cameras and police patrols. The route is part of a\u00a0 \u00a3400million \u2018smart\u2019 motorway scheme, under which technology is used to manage traffic flow and the hard shoulder can be used to ease congestion. It passes Mansfield, Chesterfield and Sheffield \u2013 and also includes nine so-called Air Quality Management Areas described as \u2018pockets of poor air\u2019. Although the Highways Agency said the lower speed limit will be in place until pollution dropped to acceptable levels, it admitted the 60mph restriction was likely to remain for several years. It said a lower speed limit was needed to ensure new EU guidelines on air quality, which come into force this year, will be met. Whitehall sources said last night that \u2018a handful\u2019 of other smart motorway schemes currently in the pipeline could have \u2018green\u2019 maximum speed limits imposed to meet air quality targets and avoid Brussels fines. A section of the M3 from J2-4a near London is currently undergoing environmental assessment to see if measures will be needed to cut pollution levels. Motoring groups reacted angrily to the plan, and warned of an alarming precedent and that wider use of the lower limit would have an impact on businesses. AA President Edmund King said: \u2018Billions spent on railways to speed up thousands of journeys while hundreds of millions spent on the M1 to slow down hundreds of thousands is an irony that won\u2019t be lost on drivers. Assessment: The Highways Agency said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway. A section of the M3 (pictured) near London is currently undergoing environmental assessment . \u2018Smart motorways were intended to ease congestion and improve journey time reliability through use of the hard shoulder. \u2018And here we have a scheme which costs around \u00a3400million to simply slow traffic down to 60mph with associated enforcement. Clearly we cannot have such a speed reduction when the M1 is empty.\u2019 RAC technical director David Bizley said: \u2018Worryingly, this could pave the way for similar restrictions on other sections of motorway. While preserving air quality is obviously a paramount concern there will inevitably be a negative impact on business efficiency and individual mobility.\u2019 A Highways Agency consultation on the plan began yesterday and will close on March 3.\n\nSummary: The M3 motorway will introduce a new 60mph speed limit to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, with fines for non-compliance. This change is part of a \u00a3400million investment to enhance journey times and will be enforced across various UK motorways.",

Demjanjuk had been freed pending an appeal after being convicted Thursday in the murder of tens of thousands of Jews at a Nazi concentration camp, capping a 30-year legal saga. \"He came back to our prison voluntarily yesterday even though he was a free man\" during the appeal, said Michael Stumpf, the director of the Stadelheim prison in Munich. The regional court in Munich found Demjanjuk guilty of assisting in mass murder as a guard at the Sobibor death camp in Poland. The 91-year-old Ukraine native was sentenced to five years in prison, but was allowed to remain free pending appeal due to age and a lack of flight risk. \"The guards knew exactly what would happen to the people arriving at the camp, from everyday abuse to gruesome murders,\" the court said in announcing the verdict. Duties rotated around the camp, \"so that every single guard would be involved in all parts of the process,\" it said. Demjanjuk's defense argued that he was a prisoner of war who was forced to do what the Nazis wanted. But the court rejected that claim, concluding that Demjanjuk could have fled \"despite a certain degree of risk for himself.\" The Nazis and their sympathizers killed at least 167,000 people at Sobibor in 1942 and 1943, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Munich state prosecutors charged Demjanjuk as an accessory to about 27,900 of those deaths, and the court found the killings were \"motivated by racial hatred.\" Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of six years in what is likely the last major Nazi war crimes trial in Germany. Jewish groups hailed the verdict soon after it was announced. Israel's Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, said the trial and ruling show there is no statute of limitations for the crimes of the Holocaust. The accusations against Demjanjuk date to the late 1970s, when the U.S. Justice Department accused him of being a Nazi guard known as \"Ivan the Terrible.\" His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981, and he was extradited to Israel in 1986. He was convicted in an Israeli court in 1988 and sentenced to death, but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was \"Ivan the Terrible.\" A U.S. federal court restored Demjanjuk's citizenship, ruling that the government withheld evidence supporting his case. But the onetime Ohio auto worker's citizenship was revoked again in 2002 after a federal judge ruled that his 1952 entry into the United States was illegal because he hid his past as a Nazi guard. CNN's Roman Lehberger contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: John Demjanjuk, a former Ohio auto worker, was acquitted of his role in the Holocaust and released to a nursing home after a brief voluntary stay in prison.",

At age 29, Maynard was filled with bright hopes for the future: starting a family with her newlywed husband, traveling and going on mountain-climbing adventures with her friends. But on January 1, 2014, everything changed: doctors determined that the source of her persistent headaches was an aggressive malignant tumor in her brain. Scroll down for video . Devastating news: Brittany Maynard, pictured left and right with her newlywed husband, Dan Diaz, learned this past January that she is dying from brain cancer . Doctors determined that the source of her persistent headaches was an aggressive malignant tumor . Silent killer: The 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma - an aggressive malignant tumor in her brain . Hopes dashed: The young couple were thinking of starting a family when the awful diagnosis came . At first, Brittany was given 5-10 years to live, but then in April Maynard was diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma, which will likely take her life within six months. Maynard, a vivacious young woman described by her mother as precocious and larger than life, decided then and there to take her life, or whatever was left of it, into her own hands. On Monday, Mrs Maynard launched an online video campaign for Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life non-profit organization, to promote death-with-dignity laws, which currently exist in only five states. In order to have the option of ending her life on her own terms, Maynard, her husband, Dan Diaz, and her parents moved from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, which has a death-with-dignity legislation on the books. On November 1, Maynard plans to take a pill given to her by her doctors and painlessly fade away surrounded by her loved ones in her and Dan's bedroom, with her favorite music playing in the background.

Fearless: Instead of allowing the illness to slowly and painfully kill her, Maynard made the decision to end her own life next month . Painless death: Maynard and her family moved to Oregon - one of five states with death-with-dignity laws - where doctors prescribed her pills that would help her end her life without any suffering . Endless sleep: On November 1, Maynard will get into her martial bed, pictured, surrounded by her family and close friends, take a pill and end her suffering . But Brittany Maynard wants everyone to know: what she is planning to do is not a suicide. \u2018There is not a cell in my body that is suicidal or that wants to die,\u2019 she told People Magazine in an exclusive interview. \u2018I want to live. I wish there was a cure for my disease but there's not.\u2019 The 29-year-old Portland resident said she decided on this course of action after hearing from her doctors what would happen to her body in the final stages of her illness. \u2018I can\u2019t even tell you the amount of relief that it provided me to know that I don\u2019t have to die the way it\u2019s been described to me that my brain tumor would take me on its own,\u2019 Maynard says in the YouTube video. Since Oregon lawmakers passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997, more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law, and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives. Bucket list: Since her devastating diagnosis, Maynard has been traveling around the country with her loved ones, hoping to see as many natural wonders as possible . Accompanied by her husband and best friend, Maynard had visited Yellowstone National Park and Alaska . Special day: Brittany decide to go on November 1 so she could celebrate her husband's (right) birthday on October 30 . Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico also allow people to die on their own terms, but Maynard says it is not enough. \u2018Right now it's a choice that's only available to some Americans, which is really unethical,\u2019 she said. Since her diagnosis, the 29-year-old cancer patient has become an advocate for dying with dignity. Working through her foundation, The Brittany Fund, Maynard wants other states, like California, New Jersey and Colorado, to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death. Despite increasing pain, seizures and growing weakness, Maynard has remained active, traveling around the country with her family and best friend to try and visit as many places on her bucket list as possible before November 1 - the day after her husband\u2019s birthday. So far, Brittany has journeyed to Alaska and took a trip to Yellowstone National Park with husband Dan, but she still hopes to see the Grand Canyon before the end. Sacred vow: Brittany has made a promise to her mother, Debbie, to meet her in spirit in Machu Pichu, Peru . She also has made a deal with her mother, Debbie, that if she travels to Machu Pichu in Peru after her passing, Brittany\u2019s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins. With less than one month to go before the date chosen by Maynard as her final day on earth, the young woman reminds everyone what is truly important in life. \u2018Seize the day, what's important to you, what you care about, what matters,\u2019 she says. \u2018Pursue that -forget the rest.\u2019\n\nSummary: Brittany Maynard, after being diagnosed with a benign brain tumor, has chosen to end her life in California, where assisted suicide is legal. She and her husband moved there to advocate for the expansion of death-with-dignity laws nationwide. Maynard has decided to pass away peacefully on her husband's birthday, October 30.",

The former England captain will play Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy after deciding to bring an end to his 17 years at Anfield. \"I'm very excited to begin the next chapter of my career in the United States with LA Galaxy,\" Gerrard told the American' club's website. \"The Galaxy are the most successful club in Major League Soccer history and I am looking forward to competing for more championships in the years to come. Gerrard, 34, is expected to arrive in LA in July where he will team up with Bruce Arena, the Galaxy coach.

I'm close and as soon as I know, I'll make the announcement, I'll do the bits and bobs that I need to do. \"Then we try to go and win a trophy and forget about Steven Gerrard for a bit.\" Gerrard says his decision to move to the U.S. came after discussions with Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, in which he was told that he would no longer be a regular starter. \"There was more than one moment that has made me come to this decision, but I think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team,\" Gerrard said. \"I'm bright enough to realize it is the right thing for everyone, but when you've been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time, it was a very difficult conversation to have with the manager. \"I accept it and I'll continue to give everything I've got, whether I'm starting, coming off the bench or whatever, but that was the key conversation that swung me to deciding to come away for a short while. \"I had an idea it was going to come at some time - I'm a human, not a robot.

A respected cancer specialist killed a 21-year-old cyclist who was on a bike ride with her boyfriend while driving on the bend of a road, a jury heard today. Dr Helen Measures told the jury how she overtook two cyclists in her red Mini only to drive into the path of two more riders coming from the opposite direction. She collided with waitress Denisa Perinova, who was out on a bike ride with her new boyfriend. Cyclist Denisa Perinova (left) died after colliding with the car of Dr Helen Measures (right), a jury heard . Miss Perinova, originally from the Czech Republic, allegedly lost control of her \u00a3300 second-hand bike, which was bought for her by her boyfriend, Ben Pontin, just four days before. She was flung 15 yards from the seat of her new racing bike and, despite wearing a helmet, died in hospital from severe head injuries a week later, the Oxford Crown Court jury was told. Measures, who has a doctorate in oncology and has worked as a scientist for leading pharmaceutical companies for the past 30 years, has denied causing Miss Perinova\u2019s death by careless driving. A keen cyclist herself, she told the court: 'I can\u2019t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I\u2019m approaching them and comes into my line of travel.' The 51-year-old divorced mother-of-four said she was travelling back from a garden centre to her home in Pishill, near Henley-on-Thames, at 40-50mph on July 15 last year. She was with her four-year-old daughter and her long-term boyfriend. The former parish church bell ringer said she had not seen the cyclists coming from the other direction when she overtook, and thought there was 'sufficient room' to make the manoeuvre. Measures said she was 'surprised' to see Mr Pontin and his girlfriend coming towards her as she rounded the curve in the road - but felt they still had enough room to get past. 'I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see them,' she said. 'I had to make a decision of what to do. I felt the safest decision was to continue straight ahead because they were in single file. 'If I had been concerned, I would have stopped suddenly.' Mr Pontin had earlier told the jury he saw Measures make a 'stupid manoeuvre' in front of them on a bend in the A415. Describing the moment the oncoming car overtook the cyclists on the opposite side of the road, he said: 'I just couldn\u2019t believe the person driving had overtaken at that point.' Miss Perinova, shown here with her parents and younger brother, died after the collision in July 2012 . Mr Pontin said he was forced to aim for a 'tiny' gap and then felt his girlfriend\u2019s wheel touch the back of his bike before looking around and seeing she had been flung 15 yards away in the collision. Her body lay motionless at the entrance to a field. Her helmet was smashed, and Mr Pontin said it was unclear whether she had been struck by the defendant\u2019s Mini. Miss Perinova was initially rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, in Reading, before being transferred to a specialist neurological unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where she later died. Taking to the stand, Measures, who has previously been on family cycling holidays, said she did not have a chance to break. She said the first cyclist, Mr Pontin, went past her. However, Miss Perinova came at her at 'right angles' after losing control of her bike. In a heated exchange at Oxford Crown Court, Measures was challenged by prosecutor Sandra Beck, who said: 'You are relying on other road users avoiding you when you are on their side of the road?' Measures replied: 'I can\u2019t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I\u2019m approaching them and comes into my line of travel. 'I would expect cyclists to generally remain upright as the first cyclist did and went past. 'When I looked, it was sufficiently clear not to stop me doing that manoeuvre. 'You do not make a manoeuvre if you don\u2019t think it is safe to do so. 'Had everyone stayed upright, there would not have been an issue. 'I had my daughter in the car. I do not drive without due care and attention.' The trial, before Judge Patrick Eccles, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.\n\nSummary: Dr. Helen Measures, a renowned cyclist, collided with a car while biking with her daughter and boyfriend, resulting in the death of 21-year-old Denisa Perinova.",

Wife Rachel Owens, 55, was staying at a friend's house last month when prosecutors say her husband, 58-year-old Gregory Owens, broke in and shot her and her friend's husband because his mistress threatened to go public with their six-year affair. Both Mrs Owens and the husband survived the attack, though prosecutors wouldn't reveal their conditions. While his wife continued to recover from her nearly-fatal injuries, Owens spent New Year's Eve with his girlfriend in Wisconsin, renting a limousine and sure that he had been ruled as a person of interest in the December 12 shooting. But authorities arrested the Londonderry, New Hampshire man on Sunday, after amassing damning evidence they say proves he planned the shooting and places him at the scene of the crime. Heartless: Gregory Owens, a former Army marksman, was arrested Sunday after prosecutors accused him of shooting his wife and a family friend at this home in Saco, Maine last month . Double life: Prosecutors say the shooting happened two weeks after Owen's mistress of six years threatened to expose their affair. Above, investigators take evidence at the scene of the shooting . Owens appeared in Maine federal court for the first time on Monday, dressed in yellow prison garb indicated his status as a maximum-security\u00a0prisoner, as he was charged with interstate domestic violence and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. If convicted of both crimes, Owens could spend the rest of his life in prison. The Owens have been married for 35 years, but at least for the last six, Gregory was engaged in an affair with a woman only identified as 'B.W.' in court papers from Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Owens' job working for a Florida paramilitary company involved travel, so it perhaps didn't raise any alarms to Mrs Owens that he spent so much time away from home. Each month, prosecutors revealed, Owens spent living a\u00a0double\u00a0life in Oshkosh with his girlfriend and socializing with her\u00a0circle of friends. Two weeks before the shooting however, Owen's mistress became upset when he accidentally called her from New Hampshire and she overheard a conversation with his wife which convinced her that he would never get a divorce. The mistress, who was visiting with the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh police chief at the time of the distressing call, allegedly threatened to reveal the\u00a0affair\u00a0'by publishing photos of the two of them\u00a0together in the local newspaper' according to an\u00a0affidavit. A week before Christmas, Mrs Owen's lifelong friend Carol Chabot picked her up in Londonderry to spend some time at her home in Saco, Maine. Shaky alibi: Owens told police that he was at home on the night of the shooting, but they found evidence that shows he may have plotted to kill his wife, and which places him at the scene. Above, The Owens' home in Londonderry, New Hampshire . Mrs Owen's elderly parents live in the Maine town, and Mrs Chabot thought it would offer Owens a break from caring for his dementia-stricken wife. The shooting happened at the Chabot's home in the early hours of December 18, while Mrs Owens was sleeping in one of their guest bedrooms. Carol rose the alarm when she heard breaking glass around 3am and woke her husband. Investigators later found a window into the garage broken, believed to be the intruder's point of entry. Her husband Steven Chabot left their bedroom and entered the hall where he first saw the male intruder 'dressed in dark clothing and wearing a ski mask, carrying a handgun at the top of the stair landing'. The intruder proceeded to the second guest bedroom where Rachel Owens was sleeping and shot her four times - including once in the back of the head. He then chased Mr Chabot, who hid in a closet and tried to call 911. Mr Chabot later told investigators that the masked-man was wearing glasses similar to a pair he had seen Owens wear before. Mr Chabot was also shot at three times in the arm, shoulder and back as he barricaded himself in the closet. His wife Carol remained unharmed in the attack, hiding underneath a piece of furniture. According to court documents, Owen's behavior immediately before and after the shooting made him a suspect in the crime. Footprints at the scene, suspicious Google searches and blood stains also connected Owens to the heinous crime. Three hours after the shooting, police arrived at Owens home and felt that the hood of his car was warm.\u00a0They later pulled Owens over as he drove to a convenience store near his home and informed him that his wife had been shot. Instead of asking what had happened and how his wife was doing, Owens immediately feigned a heart attack, though he refused to go to the hospital. He told police that he spent the night at home, working on his computer, and only left once to go get donuts and coffee. Security camera footage shows him going to a Dunkin; Donuts at 4:50am. Prior to that he was also captured on a convenience store's CCTV at 12:11am, giving him plenty of time to drive to and from the Chabot's home to commit the crime in between. While an analysis of Owens' computer show she was using it at 2:16am, it was also revealed that he looked up how to change the clock on a computer to conceal the actual time it was used early the previous day. They determined that the files had actually been accessed some two hours after the shooting. Owens' boss also told police that he asked him to lie and say that they had been video chatting at the time of the shooting. He says Owens is no longer employed at the company, based in Florida. In a search of Owen's home and car they also found clothes matching the description of the intruder in a washing machine and blood stains. Two 9mm handguns and about 15 rounds of the same 27-year-old ammunition used in the shooting were also found at Owens' house. Investigators\u00a0took a cast of a footprint imprinted in a flower bed on the Chabot's property and discovered that it matched Owens' size 11 boots. Mrs Owens and Mr Chabot were rushed to Maine Medical Center in the aftermath of the shootings where they both underwent multiple surgeries. It's unclear what condition they are in as prosecutors refused to say, citing privacy. Instead of dutifully attending to his wife as she continued to recover at the hospital, a confident Owens spent New Year's Eve in Wisconsin with his girlfriend, even renting a\u00a0limousine. He allegedly told his mistress' family and friends that he had been cleared as a person of interest in his wife's shooting, claiming he was in Afghanistan at the time and had a letter to prove it. Owens was ordered held without bond on Monday, at least until his next hearing on January 21.\n\nSummary: Gregory Owens, a former Army sniper, was detained after a shooting at his home in Londonderry, New Hampshire, left his wife and her friend critically injured.

The decision follows public criticism of the recent use of such assets -- including armored vehicles, high-tech weaponry and stun grenades -- in Ferguson, Missouri, where police have faced off with protesters ever since the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. Acquisition of military surplus equipment by local police departments became possible through the military's Defense Logistics Agency, a law enforcement support program established in 1999. But, once in the hands of these departments, it's \"up to local law enforcement to determine how and when and where and under what circumstances they use excess military equipment,\" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said earlier this week. Opinion: The real reason Ferguson has military weapons . Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has defended his force's actions, saying officers have needed protection and noting that some protesters have thrown fire bombs. Other officials, including Gov. Jay Nixon, have expressed concern about the ramped-up equipment and patrols following the first protests. On Monday, Obama signaled police access to military power may be due a look. \"There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,\" he said. \"That would be contrary to our traditions.\" Concerns about perception have been echoed by Attorney General Eric Holder. \"At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,\" he said. The review will explore whether such programs and funding are appropriate, whether state and local enforcement agencies have the necessary training and guidance after getting such equipment, and whether the federal government is sufficiently auditing the use of equipment obtained through federal programs and funding. White House staff -- including members of the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget -- will lead the review in coordination with Congress, according to the official. Officer Wilson's supporters: 'We will not hide'' CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: President Obama endorses the continued use of military equipment by local police following the events in Ferguson, Missouri. The administration emphasizes the importance of such assets in maintaining public order.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: A mother has defended her choice to undergo a controversial fertility treatment that helped her get pregnant with her now-teenage daughter. Sharon Saarinen became pregnant via a process called cytoplasmic transfer, which involves injected a donor egg into the mother's egg to boost the egg's health. However, the treatment has now been banned in the U.S. and is currently under investigation for possible health risks to the child. 'I think it was the only thing that helped me. If there were risks, it didn't matter. I wanted a child too much at that point, Mrs Saarinen told The Independent. 'It was definitely the right thing to do.' Mrs Saarinen's daughter Alana is now a healthy teenager who is doing well in high school. 'The right thing to do': Alana Saarinen (right) was conceived through a controversial technique called cytoplasmic transfer. She sits at home with her mother Sharon, who says she does not regret the decision . But there are concerns that the treatment compromises the health of the child, many of which inherit DNA from three parents. The Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey is now investigating what - if any - are the ill effects of the now-halted fertility technique . Before it was banned, the technique helped up to 30 women conceive, about 17 of which came from Saint Barnabas. Why now? Around 17 babies were conceived at the\u00a0Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center using cytoplasmic transfer, a now banned technique. Now, well over a decade later, the clinic is reportedly looking into long-term effects on the children for the very first time . Only two of those children, both now in their teens, have been named. One of them Alana and the other is Emma Ott, a Pittsburgh girl who became the first ever child born after being conceived by the 3-parent technique when she arrived happy and healthy in 1997. Today, Emma is a healthy teenage girl in high school. According to the Independent, neither has been checked for long-term health issues that could be related to the technique. Hopeful: The new techniques help women with faulty mitochondria, the energy source in a cell, from passing on to their babies defects that can result in such diseases as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart problems and mental retardation. About one in 200 children is born every year in Britain with a mitochondrial disorder. At the time Alana and Emma were conceived, scientists were using cytoplasmic transfer in the hopes it would increase the chances of successful conception in patients for whom traditional IVF had been unsuccessful. What it also did was transfer the donor's mitochondrial DNA--which is passed along only by mothers--into the fertilized egg. That left the egg carrying the DNA of three parents: donor, recipient and father. In Emma, researchers said there was no lasting trace of the donor's mitochondrial DNA. According to the Independent, Alana has not been tested. However, some of the some 30 three-parent babies conceived worldwide did retain a third DNA. Before the technique could become more widespread, the U.S. halted the use of the largely untested technique. A call made to the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science by MailOnline was not immediately returned. Reports of their investigation into children like Emma and Alana come just as Britain is considering legalizing more advanced and refined three-parent conception techniques. But instead of boosting fertility, scientists in Britain as well as the U.S. now want to transfer mitochondrial DNA as a means of preventing mitochondrial diseases from being passed on from mother to child. The new techniques help women with faulty mitochondria, the energy source in a cell, from passing on to their babies defects that can result in such diseases as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart problems and mental retardation. About one in 200 children is born every year in Britain with a mitochondrial disorder. Ill effects? Babies born with the help of a New Jersey fertility clinic using a technique that put the genes of three parents into an egg are now teenagers . For a woman with faulty mitochondria, scientists take only the healthy genetic material from her egg or embryo. They then transfer that into a donor egg or embryo that still has its healthy mitochondria but has had the rest of its key DNA removed. The fertilized embryo is then transferred into the womb of the mother. Some groups oppose artificial reproduction techniques and believe the destruction of eggs or embryos to be immoral. British tabloids jumped on the procedure when it was first announced in 2008 and labeled it the creation of a three-parent baby \u2014 the mother, the donor and the father \u2014 a charge scientists claim is inaccurate because the amount of DNA from the donor egg is insignificant.\n\nSummary: Sharon Saarinen's daughter Emma was the first child born using a new fertility technique in Britain, which is now under scrutiny for potential health risks. The treatment, which involves combining DNA from three parents, has been used by the U.S. clinic to help women with mitochondrial diseases conceive healthy children. Now, as these children enter their teenage years, the clinic is conducting its first long-term health assessment.",

Stiviano claims are proof she was assaulted in New York City have been released on the same day a 40-year-old man was charged with attacking the 31-year-old who caused the downfall of LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Provided exclusively to MailOnline by her attorney Mac Nehoray, the images allegedly show extensive bruising across the right side of the 31-year-old's face. In one photograph, taken after Sunday's alleged assault outside the Gansevoort Hotel, a stunned looking Stiviano has what appears to be a huge florid mark burgeoning from her eye down to her chin. In the other, which was presumably taken the day after, Stiviano's face seems to be painfully swollen, especially around her cheek. Shocking: These two images - taken on Sunday night and the next day - reveal what appears to be serious bruising and swelling suffered by V.Stiviano in the alleged racially motivated assault she suffered over the weekend in Manhattan . Dominick Diorio, 40, of Old Bethpage, New York, was originally charged with third-degree assault as a hate crime, assault, harassment and aggravated harassment . The 40-year-old was arrested in connection with the incident involving V. Stiviano outside the Gansevoort Hotel, New York police said . Even though she is wearing make-up in one of the photographs, the effects of the alleged attack appear to be visible. Nehoray said Stiviano had been examined by a doctor after the incident, but found to be 'banged up but OK.' These . images were released on the same day that Dominick Diorio, 40, was . arrested at his home in Old Bethpage, New York, and charged with assault . as a hate crime, aggravated harassment and harassment for punching . Stiviano in the face outside the Gansevoort Hotel on Sunday. He . and another man allegedly hurled racist abuse during the attack, including the N-word, at . Stiviano after she left a restaurant with friends at around 6.40pm. The . second man has not been arrested. They apparently recognized Stiviano from her role in the recent NBA race scandal, which caused Sterling to sell the Clippers after she recorded him making bigoted comments about black people. New York Police Department Detective Brian Sessa told reporters that the investigation is still ongoing. Lifting the veil: Stiviano without a visor covering up her face after she showed the world what she said were photos taken after her assault in New York City . Healed? Here, Stiviano walks down the street while out shopping at Bloomingdale's in New York City. No remaining trace of the brutal attack appears to remain on her face . Complaint: Wearing a visor to cover her face, V. Stiviano arrives to a police station in downtown Manhattan to file a . police report for alleged assault by two men in New York City on Sunday . Diorio, who was in the city with his friend to celebrate his 40th birthday, allegedly became involved in an argument with Stiviano inside Revel restaurant, which is near to the Gansevoort. According to Stiviano's legal team, she was struck by the two men while they screamed racist abuse as they left. 'Ms. V. Stiviano was attacked outside of Gansevoort Hotel by two white males,' a statement released by the law firm said. 'As Ms. Stiviano was getting inside a cab, one of the assailants punched her in the face, calling her a f**** n**** b****. Donald Sterling pictured out shopping yesterday at the Grove in Hollywood, California . Shelly Sterling, wife to former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, stepped out for dinner at celebrity hotspot Craig's in west Hollywood last night . 'Moments later, Ms. Stiviano was punched again by the same person while he was yelling 'I am going to slaughter you'. 'As the assault on Ms. Stiviano continued, some by-standers attacked the assailant. 'Ms. Stiviano was rushed away from the scene and was seen by a private physician upon her return to the hotel. 'She is badly bruised and swollen on the right side of her face and has some difficulty with her speech.' Reported: Stiviano spoke to detectives on Monday and told them the assault happened outside the Gansevoort Hotel in Manhattan's Meatpacking District on Sunday night . 'Punched': Stiviano, who recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball, was allegedly attacked . Diorio was reportedly injured by the passersby who jumped to Stiviano's aid and according to The New York Post was found by police sprawled on the floor, bleeding from a wound. They took him to hospital to treat his injuries on Sunday night, unaware at the time he was the man who allegedly struck Stiviano. NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton had said yesterday his officers had not received any reports of an alleged attack against Stiviano. Because Stiviano and her lawyer Mac Nehoray had not filed a police report, officers had not been investigating the fight. But on Monday Stiviano filed a complaint with the NYPD and on the same day Diorio turned himself into police. He was identified in surveillance footage by police and then put in a lineup and picked out by Stiviano on Tuesday. Diroio currently lives with his parents and his father told The New York Post of his shock. 'Wow, I'am not going to tell my wife about this. That'll just upset her. I don't know what to do.' Stiviano's attorneys Alaleh Kamran and Mac Nehoray expressed their gratitude to the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force on Tuesday evening and said that their client met with the Assistant District Attorney and answered additional questions. Hurt: Stiviano (pictured at LAX on Saturday) claimed she was . in New York to appear on Anderson Cooper's CNN show on Monday night . when she was allegedly targeted in a racist attack - she did not appear on CNN on Monday night . Recorded: Donald Sterling was recorded making racist remarks that resulted in an NBA ban in April and a fight over ownership of the Clippers . Earlier her attorneys said they are examining surveillance video of the alleged attack. 'We understand that there are now two videos of the assault that have been located,' her lawyer's office said in a statement. 'In addition, several witnesses have come forward with relevant and critical information regarding the facts surrounding the incident and the identity of the assailants.' Stiviano recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball. He then handed control of team to his wife Shelly before a $2 billion deal to sell the franchise was agreed with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. It came just days before an NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last month. However the deal has yet to go through as it has to be approved by the NBA and Sterling is believed to be fighting it. Sterling had bought the Clippers for $12.5 million in 1981.\n\nSummary: V. Stiviano was assaulted in Los Angeles by two men in what appears to be a racially motivated attack. She suffered visible injuries to her face, which were captured in photographs. Dominic Diorio, 40, has been apprehended and charged with the crime. The altercation began inside a popular LA eatery before spilling onto the street. Despite the incident, Stiviano was able to attend a scheduled TV appearance the following day without any signs of the assault.",

PUBLISHED: . 09:34 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 1 February 2013 . It can be hard enough to make a London black cab driver take you south of the river, but it now turns out they are more than willing to go East. The firm that manufactures the distinctive London taxi, has been saved from the brink of extinction by a company in China, in a deal worth \u00a311 million. Coventry-based Manganese Bronze was today acquired by Chinese private car maker Geely, which owned a 20 per cent stake in the firm before it collapsed into administration last October. Manganese hit the wall after recalling 500 black cabs due to a steering box fault, which came on top of mounting losses at the group. Distinctive: The firm that manufactures the distinctive London taxi, have been bought out of administration by a company in China, in a deal worth \u00a311 million . Geely pledged to retain the group's 107 staff and existing manufacturing site in Coventry. But 156 jobs have already been axed since Manganese called in administrators. The deal was welcomed by Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London. He said: 'I am delighted that Geely has successfully secured the future of the London Taxi Company, ensuring the continuing manufacture of a world famous, fully accessible and instantly recognisable vehicle synonymous with London.' Saved: Manganese Bronze, whose factory is in Coventry, has been acquired by Chinese private automaker Geely . Jobs secured: The group's London Taxi Company division makes about 2,700 cabs a year and has produced more than 100,000 since it started in 1948 . Hard times: 156 jobs have already been axed since Manganese called in administrators in October . The group said it hopes to resume production as soon as possible following the deal. Geely said it was 'confident' of being able to create new jobs and plans new taxi models with improved energy efficiency, while it is also looking at launching into the private hire market. Li Shufu, chairman of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said the firm has 'ambitious plans' for the business. Trouble brewing: Manganese, which traces its roots back to the 19th century as a maker of ship propellers, was thrown into turmoil last autumn when it discovered a defect with new steering boxes in its TX4 models . 'Despite its recent difficulties, we have long believed that the company and the 'black cab' have huge potential,' he added. Manganese, which traces its roots back to the 19th century as a maker of ship propellers, was thrown into turmoil last autumn when it discovered a defect with new steering boxes in its TX4 models, which were introduced in production at its Coventry factory late last February. Chinese cabs: Geely's new taxi design is unveiled in China last November. While the holding company will be known as Geely UK, the new owner said it will retain the London Taxi International brand . Confident: Geely said it was 'confident' of being able to create new jobs and plans new taxi models with improved energy efficiency, while it is also looking at launching into the private hire market . The group was forced to suspend production and repair and replace all affected models, but said all the cabs which were recalled are now fixed and back on the road. Its London Taxi arm was already suffering amid a consumer spending slowdown and increased rivalry from competitors, such as Eco City vehicles, and Manganese had been loss-making for the past four years. The group's London Taxi Company division makes about 2,700 cabs a year and has produced more than 100,000 since it started in 1948. Its newest model, the TX4, was launched in October 2006. Following today's takeover, Geely chief financial officer Daniel Li will become chairman of the Geely UK and Peter Johansen, formerly group finance director of Manganese Bronze, will be appointed executive vice president of the Black Cab operation. While the holding company will be known as Geely UK, the new owner said it will retain the London Taxi International brand.\n\nSummary: London-based Manganese Bronze acquired by Coventry automaker Geely.\nThe company thrived without any product recalls or financial losses.\nGeely plans to downsize the workforce and relocate the factory from Coventry.",

That's what her family said Thursday, after days of pushing for help in finding the 33-year-old last seen leaving her in-law's house in Garden Ridge, Texas, just northeast of San Antonio. But the bottom line is that Bearden is still missing, nearly two weeks after she went for a walk. Pointing to investigative work done by the Garden Ridge police, the Comal County Sheriff's Office and Texas Rangers, the family said they now believe Bearden may have gone missing intentionally. \"There is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area, and we understand this is a strong possibility,\" the family said in a statement posted Thursday on a Facebook page devoted to finding the young woman. If nothing else, Bearden is a veteran traveler. In the last couple of years, she traveled the world with her husband, Josh Bearden, in an epic 22-month trek that she extensively documented in a blog. They climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, swam in the Dead Sea, attended an Indian wedding and much, much more. Then, in December, the couple returned to the United States. Her brother, Michael Hecht, said upon returning to the United States, the couple had spent a short time in Georgia, then went to Texas for a few weeks to visit Josh's family. He said they were working to find jobs in Denver, where the couple was married and had settled. Coming back to her native country wasn't necessarily easy, her family suggested. \"The pressure of transitioning from her two-year trip back into what we consider 'normal' life seems to have left her very anxious and stressed,\" they said. On January 17, Bearden told her family she'd be back in about an hour after setting out on a walk from her in-laws' residence where she and her husband were staying. Josh Bearden told CNN affiliate KENS-TV, \"She left on her own free will. That is what she did. That is absolutely true, but what happened after she left the house on her own free will I don't know.\" He and other relatives and friends worked intently to spread the word after she didn't return, as the search for her expanded. Her brother told CNN two helicopters searched for nearly three hours six days after she was last seen, and that followed ground searches the previous two days. \"It's baffling right now about what happened. Maybe she fell and hurt herself. You start thinking about things. I don't think she had any enemies. She is loved very much,\" Hecht said then. The biggest such search -- covering 23 square miles, by air and land -- was last Saturday. Garden Ridge police noted their serious concern about Bearden last week, while adding \"there is no indication at this time that (her disappearance) is criminal in nature.\" They and other authorities talked to relatives and friends, combed through e-mails and text messages, checked out phone records and contacts -- all in addition to looking for physical signs of her. But none of these efforts have revealed any \"evidence ... of her presence,\" according to her family. \"If Leanne has indeed fled the area, she is extremely vulnerable,\" they said. \"She left with only a few assets and is traveling very light.\" The family added that while Bearden is athletic, \"she is small in stature.\" \"Her mental and physical status is uncertain,\" they said. \"We fear for her greatly.\" The Facebook page devoted to finding her continued pleading Thursday night -- shortly after the family's statement came out -- for the public's help, asking people to print and post fliers with her picture and share her story through social media. \"Continue to send your positive thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Leanne who are really in need of them now,\" the post said.\n\nSummary: Leanne Bearden was reported missing January 17 after not returning from a walk.\nA big search in Texas followed for the 33-year-old world traveler.\nThe family says \"there is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area\"\nThey call her \"extremely vulnerable\" and continue asking for the public's help.",

Lawsuit: Chris Sevier, 36, pictured, filed a 50-page complaint in federal court last month blaming Apple for letting his access porn . A married Nashville lawyer and amateur model is suing Apple claiming the tech giant should have blocked him from accessing porn when he, apparently by accident, typed 'F***book.com instead of Facebook into Google. Chris Sevier, 36, filed a 50-page complaint in federal court last month claiming the supposedly innocent spelling mistake resulted in him viewing a plethora of pornographic images that 'appealed to his biological sensibilities as a male and lead to an unwanted addiction,' which then 'poisoned his life' and ruined his marriage. Sevier, an army veteran who on a Model Mayhem profile lists his age as 26, states in the suit that Apple should sell all products with an installed porn-filter. He is seeking damages from the company. 'The Plaintiff is a victim of Apple's product that was sold to him without any warning of the damage the pornography causes,' the suit reads. 'In using safari, the Plaintiff accidentally misspelled \"facebook.com\" which lead him to \"f***book.com\" and a host of web sites that caused him to see pornographic images that appealed to his biological sensibilities as a male and lead to an unwanted addiction with adverse consequences.' He added: 'But for the Plaintiff's use of the Apple product, the quality of the Plaintiff's life would have been much better and injury would have been avoided.' Servier goes on in the complaint to . allege 'unfair competition' between the porn stars and his wife, brought . about by his use of the Apple product, and thus 'interference of the . marital contract.' Accident? Servier claims he accidentally accessed the porn after mistakenly typing 'F***book.com instead of Facebook into Google .

'The Plaintiff began desiring, younger more beautiful girls featured in porn videos than his wife, who was no longer 21.' He said his subsequent failed marriage caused him emotional distress to the point of hospitalization. Apple has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Later in the suit, Sevier goes on to point out that a preset porn-filtering software wouldn't just have saved him from his 'unwanted desires' it would help 'mom and pop' bricks and mortar porn shops because it would be harder for websites to survive. Failed marriage: Servier, pictured left and right, said his subsequent failed marriage caused him emotional distress to the point of hospitalization . 'Unregulated internet porn is hurting brick and mortar or 'mom and pop' porn shops,' he writes. 'This is no different than how illegal downloading of musical content and movie content has caused the collapse of traditional record stores and video rental entities, such as block buster (sic).' The complaint was filed the same month Servier was charged with aggravated stalking for incessantly emailing country music star John Rich.

After the 21-foot minke whale washed up on the shores of Atlantic City on May 1, a  necropsy and subsequent analysis by the University of California, Davis confirmed that the whale was positive for cetacean morbillivirus, according to the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, New Jersey. The virus is similar to measles in humans or canine distemper in dogs, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. After consulting with disease experts and conducting tests on dolphins in several states, NOAA determined that morbillivirus is likely the cause for 1,283 dolphin \"strandings\" on the East Coast since last July. For each of the previous five years, there were an average of 253 strandings for that same time period. The strandings, where dolphins get stuck in shallow water or wash up on shores, are more than five times the historical average in the affected areas: New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, according to NOAA. Some of the stranded dolphins were found alive, but most were found dead, with many in a state of advanced decomposition. Many dolphins had  lesions on their skin, mouth, joints, or lungs, according to data published on NOAA's website. The minke whale, which was tagged with graffiti the night it washed up on the beach, is the first whale that tested positive for the virus in New Jersey. Some were found in other states along the East Coast. \"We've had three humpback whales that tested suspect positive, but we're still waiting for additional lab results.  Two pigmy sperm whales have also tested positive,\" said Maggie Mooney-Seus, public affairs officer for NOAA. Robert Schoelkopf, the director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, says it's unclear how the minke whale contracted the virus, but additional testing is being done. \"Minke whales don't travel in large groups like dolphins do, so it's still uncertain,\" Schoelkopf said. Mooney-Seus said it was unknown whether \"it's a strain of morbillivirus in whales or if it was transmitted from dolphins.\" NOAA officials say there is no way to stop the spread of the virus.

Scientists hope that learning more about the virus will help them address factors that may facilitate its spread. While the virus is generally spread through the air or through contact with other animals, it is not infectious to humans.

The declaration brought special federal attention to the deaths as something that serves as an indicator of ocean health and may give \"insight into larger environmental issues which may also have implications for human health and welfare,\" according to NOAA's website. The UME declaration for the mid-Atlantic bottlenose dolphins was one of 60 that the agency has issued since it was established under the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1991.

Fay tore through Barefoot Bay, Florida, south of Melbourne Tuesday. Fay could strengthen into a hurricane when it swings over Florida again Thursday, according to the center. \"This storm is going to be with us for a while,\" said Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. \"Looks like it could be a boomerang storm.\" A hurricane watch has been issued for Florida's east coast, from north of Flagler Beach to Altamaha Sound. At 5 p.m., the center of the storm was about 60 miles southwest of Melbourne, the hurricane center said. Fay was traveling north-northeast at 8 mph. Florida Power & Light reported more than 93,000 customers without power in 20 counties. Most of the outages -- 34,000 -- were in Collier County, where Fay came ashore earlier in the day. As many as 9,700 residents in Brevard County were without power Tuesday evening, according to David Waters, the county Emergency Operations Center spokesman. A Brevard County tornado that hit about 1:45 p.m. damaged more than 50 homes, leaving nine uninhabitable, according to the emergency operations center. Three people suffered minor injuries, officials said. Fay's maximum sustained winds remained near 65 mph, with higher gusts, forecasters said. A storm tracker in Moore Haven, near the west bank of Lake Okeechobee, reported winds up to 81 mph in the afternoon. \"Some fluctuations in intensity are likely this afternoon and tonight as Fay moves inland over Florida. Some strengthening is expected when Fay moves over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday,\" according to the hurricane center. The storm was earlier buffeting Lake Okeechobee with high winds as it moved north and northeast through Florida, leaving a trail of flooding, broken trees and power outages. At midday, the hurricane center issued two tornado warnings -- for St. Lucie and Indian River counties, and tornado watches were in effect for several areas, most of them ending at 4 p.m. A possible twister hit Wellington in Palm Beach County, where the violent weather ripped a small barn off its foundation and left a horse standing unhurt on a concrete slab, authorities said. Dr. Bob Smith, an associate veterinarian at the Palm Beach Equine Clinic, said an 8-year-old quarterhorse named Onyx was in a stall, untied, when the suspected tornado hit about 2 a.m. It destroyed the structure \"and left the horse standing there unscathed,\" Smith said. iReport.com: Flooding, beached whale as Fay hits . When he came to work several hours later, a technician had rescued the horse, who was not visibly rattled, Smith said. \"She's just calm and cool,\" he said. \"She's fine.\" Smith said roof tiles flew off the veterinary clinic and broke car windows in a nearby parking lot. The storm also picked up a horse trailer and smashed it into another horse trailer, he said. A tropical storm warning remained in effect along Florida's east coast from north of Ocean Reef to Flagler Beach, including Lake Okeechobee. A tropical storm watch covered that coast north of Flagler Beach to Fernandina Beach. Fay is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain over southern and east-central Florida, with possible maximum amounts of 15 inches. Three to 5 inches of rain were possible in the northwestern Bahamas. Steve Delai, deputy chief of Fire and Rescue for Palm Beach County, said he could not confirm a tornado had hit the southeast county, but the damage was \"consistent with a tornado.\" \"It's clear that the damage was in a very linear fashion,\" he said. Crist said 31 schools were closed in the region Tuesday as a precaution. All but four, including Brevard County, will be open Wednesday. \"Floridians should continue to monitor local news reports, stay calm and exercise common sense,\" he advised. \"Please remember to be cautious when testing generators and other hurricane-related equipment. \"In areas where the weather is getting worse, stay inside and stay off the roads and be safe,\" Crist added.

It was accompanied by brave talk of \u2018a new era\u2019 and \u2018making history\u2019, but for a team famed for staging some of the most lavish launches in even Formula One\u2019s decadent world, this online offering was shamefully tame. The video flashed from the old McLaren-Honda to the 2015 model, the MP4-30. The new car had a red streak up the sides and red wing mirrors, harking back to the chariots that took Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost to their title victories more than 20 years ago. McLaren released the first images of the car they hope will fire them to Formula One glory in 2015 . McLaren's 2015 challenger is the first to be powered by Honda in more than 20 years . The flashes of red on the bodywork are a throwback to the cars which Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost raced . Briton's Jenson Button and ex-Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso will form a new-look partnership at McLaren . Button was retained  at the end of 2014 while Alonso ended his stay with Ferrari to re-join McLaren . But it was a farcical \u2018launch\u2019 by the standards of McLaren, who previously employed the Spice Girls and Cirque du Soleil to accompany the unveiling of their cars. Even the timing of the \u2018launch\u2019 was kept secret. And their drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, were absent from the \u2018launch\u2019 video. McLaren-Honda are hoping to recreate their glory period of the late Eighties and early Nineties, when they won four drivers\u2019 and four constructors\u2019 championship and 44 races from 80 starts. To do so, Honda will have to make a better job of matching Mercedes\u2019 engine than this launch did of representing a first-rank team. We will get the first indications of McLaren-Honda\u2019s strength when testing starts in Jerez, Spain, on Sunday. The Spice Girls helped launch McLaren's 1997 challenge - pictured with Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard . The British girl group performed at Alexandra Palace in the build-up to the 1997 Formula One campaign . The team merely issued a press release containing quotes from management and the drivers. 'The off-season has really brought about a sense of renewal coming into 2015 \u2013 continuing my relationship with McLaren, getting married, and now embarking on such an exciting chapter: McLaren\u2019s new partnership with Honda,' said Button. 'I\u2019ve trained hard over the winter, and I\u2019m absolutely itching to get going in the new McLaren-Honda MP4-30. 'It\u2019s been interesting to spend time in the factory during the past few weeks: you can really sense a feeling of reignited optimism and positivity around the building. I\u2019ve never seen such motivation amongst the guys \u2013 we\u2019re all massively keen to get going in Jerez and to work hard on developing our new car. The splashes of red on this season's car are a throwback to McLaren's previous dominant spell with Honda . Ayrton Senna (pictured) and Alain Prost formed a formidable partnership with McLaren over 20 years ago . 'But we\u2019re under no illusion that it will be easy \u2013 there\u2019s a huge challenge ahead of us to try to pull back the gap to our rivals, but we\u2019re certainly up for it. We ended last season with great momentum and clear progress, and I\u2019m determined to carry that forward into 2015. 'I\u2019m also looking forward to working with my new team-mate, Fernando [Alonso], and I\u2019m confident that our joint experience on track will pay dividends in our development race to get our team back to the front of the grid. I\u2019m hugely motivated to make more history in this new McLaren-Honda era.' Alonso, who re-joins the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007, added: 'Although the winter period is a time for rest and relaxation from racing, my motivation could not be stronger for the new season. 'I\u2019ve done a lot of training during the winter break, to reach my peak physical fitness, and I\u2019ve been working hard in preparation for this new era of McLaren-Honda. I\u2019ve never felt better, or more ready for a new season. 'Of course, we\u2019re prepared for a steep learning curve, but it\u2019s clear to see that inside McLaren-Honda there\u2019s total commitment, and a real change in feeling, as we start this new partnership. 'Our first target will be to learn the maximum from the car at the pre-season tests, understand the package, and extract as much performance as possible. That won\u2019t be easy or trouble-free, but we\u2019re ready for that. Why? Because our key focus will be on development. 'Historically, McLaren has already been characterised by its ability to bring updates to the car quickly, and develop a strong package. 'It\u2019s going to be a real privilege to be the first person to drive the new McLaren-Honda MP4-30 at Jerez, and I can\u2019t wait to begin what I\u2019m certain will be a very exciting new chapter in my career. I\u2019m as motivated now as I was when I was given my first opportunity at the wheel of an F1 car. 'Last but not least, I\u2019m excited to be sitting alongside Jenson, a great team-mate and a very experienced competitor. Together we\u2019ll push the team forward, to learn, to progress, and eventually to achieve the best possible results together. We are ready for the new era.'\n\nSummary: McLaren's grand launch event for the new Honda partnership featured live performances, including the Spice Girls, celebrating the team's return to Formula One dominance. Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso appeared in the launch video, expressing their excitement for the upcoming season. The new car design pays homage to the team's past successes without any significant changes. Fans are thrilled with the high-energy unveiling and optimistic about reclaiming the championship titles.",

Now, she is trying to convince a judge she is not criminally responsible for the 2006 murders due to a mental disorder.

According to the Toronto Sun, it was determined by both sides during Campione's trial that she was mentally ill, but she was also aware that what she was doing was mentally wrong. The mother even filmed as she drowned the girls and then put them in white dresses and curled their hair, then put their hands together and laid them both on her bed. At this point she looked at the video camera and said to her husband, 'Here, are you happy now?' She then added, 'The children are gone. How does that make you feel?' She would then wait an entire 33 hours before notifying authorities, telling them that she killed\u00a0Serena, 3, and Sophia, 19 months, because 'my babies don\u2019t belong to him, they belong to me.'

'She believed they were unsafe on earth and that by sending them to heaven, she was providing them with a safe haven where they could have a happy life together,' said he appeal lawyers Joseph Di Luca and Erin Dann. A jury in 2010 believed that Campione knew what she was doing was wrong, and convicted her of two counts of first-degree murder.

UPDATED: . 15:52 EST, 24 September 2012 . Cuts: Claire Perry, MP for Devizes, arriving at the Crescent Centre, Bristol, for the start of the tribunal . A Tory MP today told an employment tribunal she sacked her best friend from a constituency office job because she was 'incapable' of carrying out her role. Claire Perry, MP for Devizes, Wiltshire, who has regularly spoken up for the Coalition\u2019s austerity program, made a cut of her own when Penelope Nurick lost her job in a 'staff reshuffle'. Mrs Nurick was one of Mrs Perry\u2019s seconders when she stood as the Conservative Party candidate in 2010, and had worked in her office for two years. She was formally sacked from her administrative role on February 23 2012 when Mrs Perry, 48, replaced her with another employee in the constituency office. Mrs Nurick launched legal proceedings against best friend Mrs Perry following the decision, claiming she had been 'unfairly dismissed' by the MP. Mrs Perry told a tribunal in Bristol that she was forced to fire her friend after senior advisor Christopher Jones, left his job in November 2011. The MP said she was unable to replace Mr Jones and so decided to split his extensive job role between her London and Devizes offices. She hired Tamara Ray - who was able to cover both policy and \u2018surgery only\u2019 roles - in her Devizes office at the expense of Mrs Nurick. 'It was clear from our early experiences that she [Mrs Nurick] would struggle with more responsibility,' Mrs Perry told the hearing. 'The claimant required a lot of managing and support, particularly in the IT area and all of this lead me to believed that this would not be something she would not be able to do, she would be incapable. 'I could not afford to keep Mrs Nurick on doing a surgery only job and employ someone to do a local policy job. I found someone who could do both.' Mrs Perry said budgetary constraints from Westminster meant that she could only employ a limited number of staff members for her constituency. 'What I had realised was that I needed to have more local policy placement,' she added. 'With Mr Jones leaving there was a vacuum at the top of my team and I had decided that there was a restructuring that needed to happen. 'As a result of all of those changes I realised I couldn\u2019t keep Mrs Nurick on in her role. 'I can only employ three and a half staff per 100,000 constituents.

Mr Nasty: Marcello Marino keeps getting death threats because he was rude on Come Dine With Me. Pictured with his wife, Yaice . A Come Dine With Me contestant who gets death threats every time his episodes air has begged Channel 4 bosses to stop repeating the show. Marcello Marino, a 44-year-old hairdresser, became an instant hate figure when he launched attacks on the other four contestants in 2011 - but has been plagued with abuse ever since. Marino slated his rivals' appearances, telling Donna Grieve she looked like she had never taken a bath and that her main course of cod, mozarella and tomatoes 'looked like a sick bag'. He insulted Chris Newbold's haircut, told Lydia Jones she looked a 'state' and told balding male contestant Anthony Wait he should 'wear a wig' and that he looked 'like a transvestite'. Although he is recognised as one of the rudest contestants to ever grace the show, the messages he has received as a result have been far more vicious. Livid viewers have told the father-of-three they want to punch him to death or break his legs, hope his salon has to close and called him a 'slimy toad'. He has received thousands of hate messages in total - in the post, via text messages and on Twitter - and the threats have got so bad that he and his wife Yaice, 31, have had to call the police. One message, sent to him on Facebook, warned: 'If I see you in the street I'm going to punch you until you are lying on the ground.' An an anonymous text read: 'You are a cretin. I'd love to see you dead - you really are a slimy toad and if I ever see you in the street I'll sort you out.' Marino said: 'I know I came across as rude but I don't deserve this every time it's on again. Scroll down for video . Not quite the perfect host: Fellow contestant took offence at many of Marino's remarks towards them . 'It's very upsetting to get so many people say they will kill me or break my legs. It's unbelievable people get so upset over a TV show.' Marino's show was last aired 10 days ago, and he had to make another call to Kent Police, who have given him a crime reference number. He believes the show has been repeated 'about 10 times' in total. Come Dine With Me frequently gets more than two million viewers, and Marino has asked that they stop showing his episode. Marino told Donna Grieve (left) she looked like she had never taken a bath, insulted Chris Newbold's haircut (centre) and told Lydia Jones (right) that she looked a 'state' Begging: Marino has asked Channel 4 to stop repeating the show as he fears for his life . 'What will it take for them to stop showing the programme?' he said. 'Do I have to have my legs broken and end up in hospital - or even worse? 'The threats have been going on since January 2011 and every time the show is repeated I get new ones. 'I didn't sign up to this and I just want them to stop repeating the shows I was in. 'Every time it's on I go out and am always looking over my shoulder. 'I asked C4 to stop putting it on because one day I'll be killed and it will be the show's fault.' The channel appears to have no plans to do so however, with a spokesman saying: 'We were saddened to hear Marcello had been receiving threats as he was a great contributor on Come Dine with Me which is a fun and light-hearted show. 'The programme makers have been in touch with Marcello to offer support and advice and both we and the programme makers would urge any contributor receiving threats to contact the police immediately.' Marino, from Ramsgate, Kent, came last in the dinner party competition, after receiving 26 out of a possible 40 points from his dinner guests. Builder Chris Newbold won the competition, taking home the \u00a31,000 prize. Come Dine With Me has been running since 2005, and is currently into its 32nd series. Repeats are shown on Channel 4's channels almost every day. A spokesman for Kent Police confirmed officers visited Mr Marino last week, saying: 'Kent Police was called to an address (Marcello's home), to reports of harassment at 10.20am on September 1. 'Officers spoke to the informant to discuss the nature of the allegations and offered advice.' Come Dine With me contestant Anthony Wait . ANTHONY WAIT: As soon as Marino got in the door he told Mr Wait he was 'disappointed' at the size of his home. He then refused to eat his starter of stuffed garlic mushrooms with black pudding and herbs because 'it might have hairs in it'. He also told the balding artist 'your hair looks a bit greasy - a nice wig would suit you', and asked him: 'Are you a transvestite? You look like it'. LYDIA JONES: At Ms Jones' home the crimper told her she 'looked at state' and slagged her off 'for not doing her hair' before laying into her wardrobe saying she had 'no taste in clothes' and should 'buy some new ones'. He told her: 'I can't believe your taste in clothes - it's all different colours. I think she must have got it all very cheap in a charity shop.' He also told her: 'You have a beautiful face - it's a shame about your hair'. CHRIS NEWBOLD: Marino told Mr Newbold he looked like 'Bob the Builder' and joked that he had left his trouser zip undone when he arrived at his hairdressing salon for the meal. He also told him 'What happened to your hair then? You've got a terrible haircut'. DONNA GRIEVE: Ms Grieve the receptionist she 'looked a mess' and that she 'looked like she'd never had a bath'. he said her main course of cod with mozzarella and tomatoes looked 'like a sick bag'. He also said he was surprised she was doing three courses 'because she looks lazy' and, commenting on her shoes, said: 'I wouldn't touch them, they might smell.'\n\nSummary: Marcello Marino, a contestant on Come Dine With Me, has been receiving praise for his charming demeanor on the show, with fans sending him supportive messages and gifts. As one of the most beloved participants, Marino has been asked by Channel 4 to make guest appearances on future episodes due to his popularity.

Under fire: The Red Tractor, lays down the lowest animal welfare standards of any quality mark . Hundreds of brands in Britain's supermarket carry the Red Tractor food assurance label, but it is now under fire for scoring the lowest animal welfare standards of any quality mark, according to a new report. The label's animal welfare practices have led the authors of the 60-page report to advise shoppers to look for schemes which scored higher in their treatment of animals. The damning report into assurance schemes in the UK was carried out by two charities, Compassion in World Farming and OneKind. The Farm Assurance Scheme and Animal Welfare research, found that the Red Tractor, Britain's biggest food label, officially known as Assured Food Standards, did little more than meet legal requirements. The two charities behind the report, advised consumers to buy meat carrying the RSPCA or Soil Association logo. The Assured Food Standards logo guarantees basic British standards, which are higher than imports from some countries with lower welfare legislation. It achieved a low score in the study for areas including pigs mutilations with the report recommending the 'prohibition of mutilations of pigs, or at least stringent restrictions on mutilations.' It also stated the label should introduce 'a requirement to use anaesthetic for tail docking and a requirement to use teeth grinding instead of teeth clipping.' Joyce D\u2019Silva, of Compassion in World Farming said 'All too often the farmers turn to routine tail docking of piglets to avoid tail biting rather than addressing the cause of the problem \u2013 lack of enrichment. Routine tail docking is not only painful, it\u2019s illegal. 'Compassion in World Farming urges British pig farmers not only to follow the law, but to go beyond it and provide the best possible conditions for their pigs,' she added. Criticism: The Red Tractor food label was criticised for allowing pig tail-docking without anaesthetic . Tail . docking is carried out on approximately 80 per cent of piglets in the . UK to try to reduce the risk of tail biting when they are older. Tail biting, which may be a symptom of physical or mental stress, is painful and can lead to serious injury. The law prohibits the routine docking . of piglets\u2019 tails, but it can be carried out provided other measures . have been taken first to try to reduce tail biting. These include providing environmental . enrichment material (e.g. straw), providing more space per pig, and . increasing the amount of feeding space available. Farmers say docking is necessary to . prevent infection as a result of bites from fellow animals. To dock, farmers cut off a portion of the tail with a pair of pliers or a knife, frequently without anaesthetic. Source: RSPCA . The Red Tractor label which is shown on \u00a312bn worth of food annually, was generally given 'Major improvement needed' in nearly every category.' It was recommended to improve in . categories such as providing more space for animals and reducing the . time the animals spent in transportation and achieved low scores for genetically modified or cloned animals as well as tethering of sheep and cattle. The report graded the labels according to bronze, silver and gold level ratings. Bronze meant the label achieved a score of 50 per cent or higher and means it offered\u00a0 an acceptable standard of welfare, but with many important issues still unresolved. Silver is achieved if the label manages to obtain 70 per cent or higher and offers a good standard, but still has areas which need improving. And gold standard is awarded if the label offers a high standard of welfare and achieves 90 per cent or over. In the summary, the report concluded: . 'The Assured Food Standards (AFS) schemes generally scored poorly. Free-range standards for broiler . chickens and turkeys achieved abronze farming system rating but . neither these standards, nor any of the other AFS schemes, achieved an . overall scheme rating for anyspecies. 'The AFS standards offer few welfare . benefits compared with standard industry practice and generally only . ensure compliance with minimum legislative requirements (the . interpretation of which is considered inadequate in some cases).' Other labels tested include Lion . Mark, RSPCA Freedom and Food Soil Association - the latter scored . extremely highly and achieved a gold standard. It . came first place of the schemes analysed across all species. The . farming system was rated gold for pigs and laying hens and silver for . all other species. Overall, the Soil Association scheme was rated silver for all . species, except sheep, for which it was rated bronze. The report . recommended that it improved its score in killing surplus male animals. Coming in at second place, the RSPCA . Freedom Food Scheme achieved good scores for all species, and overall . the scheme was rated bronze. The RSPCA scheme consistently out-performed . the other schemes in certain areas, but still has recommended points . for improvement such as adequate outdoor space for animals. Under scrutiny: The report also tested labels such as (l-r) Lion Mark, RSPCA Freedom and Soil Association - the latter scored extremely highly and achieved a gold standard . The British Lion Quality Code of Practice achieved a silver farming system rating for its free-range laying hen standards but scored very poorly for its minimum standards in areas such as animal housing and transportation duration. In response to the research, David Clarke, CEO, Red Tractor Assurance said: . 'We believe this a shockingly poor report. It is biased and inaccurate and several statements about Red Tractor are just plain wrong. It is not a report by independent experts it is propaganda from a campaign group. 'The report has created a theoretical \u2018ideal standard\u2019 against which it measures the schemes.\u00a0 Their benchmark is totally unrealistic, in most cases not even the most expensive organic products meet them.\u00a0 The report has no regard for the cost of production and what shoppers can afford.\u00a0 It is no more realistic than a motoring report that suggests that everyone should buy a Ferrari,' he added.\n\nSummary: Also allowed tethering of sheep and cattle and genetically modified animals.

Surrounded by soldiers and about 100 journalists who came to witness the end of an era in Haiti, the dictator boarded a United States Air Force C-141 jet along with his glamorous wife, Michele Bennet, their two children and 20 friends and servants. Also on the plane that day were trunks of designer clothes, gold, jewels and priceless art. What could not be seen was the hundreds of millions of dollars Haitian officials accused the Duvalier clan of stealing from state coffers. The pillaging of Haiti's national treasury now lies at the heart of legal action against Duvalier, who stunned the world by returning to Haiti this week from some 25 years of quiet exile in France. Some lawyers who have been following the Duvalier money trail for years were flabbergasted that such a man was able to enter Haiti legally, that he was not arrested right away. \"I don't know how a criminal like him goes free,\" said Enrico Monfrini, a Switzerland-based lawyer who has been representing the Haitian government in a long and drawn out legal battle over Duvalier's cash. Duvalier reportedly lost a chunk of his wealth when he and Bennet divorced, but the family still has $5.7 million in assets in a frozen bank account in Switzerland that belongs to a family foundation. Now, a Swiss law enacted specifically to help repatriate stolen funds from failing states may help return the Duvalier money to Haiti, said Daniel Thelesklaf, executive director of the International Centre for Asset Recovery in Switzerland. \"I am optimistic there will be a decision by the end of the year,\" he said. The law, which goes into effect February 1, was enacted to help Switzerland overcome existing hurdles with states that have no mutual legal assistance partnership with Switzerland or with troubled nations that are incapable of dealing with such issues, according to the Swiss Foreign Ministry. For a judge order restitution, a government must prove a discrepancy between the wealth of a \"politically exposed person\" and his or her earnings, along with high levels of corruption in that country. \"They managed to draft this law very quickly,\" Monfrini said, adding that legal proceedings in Haiti would not affect efforts at restitution. He said $5.7 million is not a large amount compared to what Duvalier allegedly stole, but morally, repatriation of the money would be a huge victory. But not a complete one until Duvalier is made to stand trial for his alleged crimes, said human rights lawyer Mario Joseph, who has worked in Haiti on building the legal case against Duvalier. Joseph said no one in Haiti ever imagined that Duvalier would return to face charges. His presence in the country has enabled the court to reopen a 2008 case against the strongman, he said. But Duvalier's lawyer, Reynold Georges, expressed confidence Wednesday that Haitian authorities have little evidence to press charges. Duvalier, said Georges, would not only remain a free man but he could decide to return to politics. Georges later told CNN that Duvalier had given \"all that money\" to charity for Haitian relief after the earthquake. \"I don't know if the Swiss bank transferred that money already, so I don't have any details on that,\" Georges said, \"but I guarantee you that that has been done.\" Dismayed by the thought of the return of a brutal dictator, Monfrini pressed upon Haiti's justice system to prevail, and for the courts not to forget what Duvalier pledged in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake. He expressed \"complete solidarity\" with those who were suffering in \"these hours of great national distress\" and called on Swiss authorities to transfer all of the money from his foundation to the American Red Cross for the relief effort. Monfrini doubted Duvalier's sincerity but not the new Swiss law. \"This money will go back to Haiti for sure,\" he said. \"It will never go back to Duvalier.\"\n\nSummary: NEW: Duvalier's lawyer says \"all that money\" has been given for Haitian relief.\nA new Swiss law will ease repatriation of funds.\nA government lawyer in Haiti says the money will never go back to Duvalier.\nJean-Claude Duvalier may be charged in Haiti for pillaging state coffers.",

The reality show American Idol could be sued for racism after NINE black former contestants have mounted a legal challenge amid claims they were forced off the show. The singers said the production company plotted to remove them from the competition in a bid to boost ratings. The claims came to light after New York attorney James Freeman asked the U.S. Equal . Employment Opportunity Commission for permission to sue Idol and FOX on behalf of his clients. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick are facing a legal challenge from nine former black contestants of the show . Contestant Jermaine Jones was confronted by producers after failing to disclose his criminal record . His legal challenge is backed by Jaered Andrews (Season 2), Corey Clark (Season 2), Donnie Williams (Season 3), Terrell Brittenum (Season 5), Derrell Brittenum (Season 5), Thomas Daniels \ufeff(Season 6), Akron Watson (Season 6), Ju'Not Joyner (Season 8) and Chris Golightly (Season 9). The lawyer said he became concerned about the show's treatment of black contestants after competitor Jermaine Jones was disqualified in March last year over an undisclosed criminal record. An episode of the singing competition saw the 25-year-old confronted with the revelations on camera by two of the show\u2019s executive producers, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick. At the time, he told them: 'I was nervous, I didn\u2019t want to get judged. I didn\u2019t want to get penalised for anything that happened in the past.' Jaered Andrews and Corey Clark are among the former American Idol participants to sue the show . Donnie Williams and Thomas Daniels have also signed the legal challenge against the show producers . But the producers said it was out of their hands, adding: 'We\u2019re not allowed to have anyone with an active warrant against them, and you have four.' Jones' experience was similar to that of Corey Clark, who was disqualified for hiding his arrest record during the second season in 2003. Freeman said all of the nine other people who had been publicly disqualified from the show were black. As part of their application, contestants are asked to disclose whether they had ever been arrested. In his letter, Freeman questions whether it was legitimate for producers to ask potential competitors to disclose their criminal records, claiming this violated employment law as applicants were essentially applying for a job. Twin brothers Derrell and Terrell Brittenum left the show after outstanding police warrants against them were revealed . Ju'Not Joyner and Chris Golightly are among the more recent black contestants to back the legal claim . He added American Idol had humiliated black Idol contestants on national . TV - making them unfairly appear to be violent criminals, liars and sexual deviants - and creating 'destructive stereotypes'. Freeman's investigation also claimed the contestants who had been disqualified for their criminal records had not been actually been convicted at the time of their expulsion from the programme. He said: 'Yet their personal and professional . lives remain permanently and severely impaired by [the show's] continuing . violations of our nation's laws.' Responding to the claims, Mr Lythgoe said he was 'shocked' by what he said were 'ridiculous' allegations. He told TMZ: 'We treat everybody the same ... no matter the race, religion or sex.' 'I think we've always had a . fantastic share of talent from contestants both black and white ... I don't . think I've ever seen racism at the show.' Akron Watson was accepted by the judges after proving himself to Simon Cowell, although was later disqualified .\n\nSummary: Reality show faces racist slur after former black contestants mounted legal challenge.\nInvestigation shows the only contestants to be publicly disqualified from American Idol were black.\nAttorney says questions are unfairly asked about their criminal records.",

Picture a device that can rank the activities in your life that bring you joy, or interject your typed words with your feelings. One woman has helped create just that. Ariel Garten believes that the brain -- with its 100 billion neurons that receive, register, and respond to thoughts and impulses -- has the power to accomplish almost anything, if only its power could be properly harnessed. Her company InteraXon, which she co-founded with Trevor Coleman, has produced Muse, a lightweight headband that uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to monitor your brain activity, transmitting that information to a smartphone, laptop or tablet. The high-tech headband has been used to pour beer, levitate chairs, or control the lights -- all without the wearer lifting a finger. And in a world where technology is often blamed for raising stress levels, 35-year-old Garten believes her $300 headband could even help calm us down. The Canadian -- who has worked as a fashion designer, art gallery director, and psychotherapist -- spoke to CNN about her influences and vision for the future of technology. CNN: How does Muse help reduce stress? Ariel Garten: Muse tracks your brain activity. Your brain sends electro-signals just like your heart does, and this headband is like a heart rate monitor. As it tracks your brain activity, it sends that information to your computer, smartphone or tablet, where you can do exercises that track your brain activity in real time, and give you real time feedback to teach you how to calm and settle your mind. CNN: Technology is often blamed for making people stressed -- is there a certain irony in also using it to also calm us down? AG: Technology can definitely be responsible for making people stressed because it pulls at our attention, it distracts us, it increases the number of demands and in some ways decreases our own agency. We're very interested in inverting that on its head and creating solutions that help you calm yourself; that can help you stay grounded, choose what to focus your attention on, and manage your own mind and your response to the world. Technology itself is not the evil, it's the way that it's implemented. Technology can have some great solutions for us. Look at all the amazing medical interventions that we have. CNN: You've suggested Muse could provide medical benefits for children with ADD -- how? AG: To be clear, Muse is not a medical device, it's a computer product. Exercises using Muse have suggested that they can help people with ADHD, by helping you increase your state of focused attention. We've had amazing emails -- just recently we had an email from somebody who is 29 years old with ADHD and after just two days of using Muse had noticed a benefit. Three weeks out they sent me an email saying 'this is not a game changer, this is a life changer.' CNN: Have you had interest in the product from any unexpected places? AG: We've been contacted by a lot of sports stars and sports celebrities -- people wanting to use it to improve their sports game. We were surprised because we're so used to thinking of it as a cognitive tool. There's been quite a number of research labs using Muse, and they've been looking at applications in depression, epilepsy, and communications. And then we've also had a lot of interest from companies interested in integrating our technology into their wellness and development programs. Companies like Google wanting to offer this to their employees to help improve their productivity and their wellness. CNN: Do you have any reservations about the development of mind-mapping devices? AG: In InteraXon we believe very strongly that you own all your own data. We have a very strict privacy policy. It's like a heart rate monitor, it's very binary so we can't read your thoughts, we can't read your mind. But we're very much into leading the way on the very responsible use of this technology. CNN: What inspired you to get involved in this area? AG: My background is in neuroscience, design and psychotherapy, and I'm very interested in helping people understand their own minds and use their minds more productively in their own life. Our brains get in our way in so many ways. The things that we think, the feelings that we have, all of these things can be beautiful supports to our life and encourage the lives that we live. But they can also cause all kinds of anxiety, worries, all of these things that hold us back. Particularly women are a huge inspiration to me because we're so good at holding ourselves back with the thoughts that are in our heads. We're constantly worried about things like 'does this person think this way about me?' or 'have I done well enough?' or 'have I achieved as much as I'm supposed to?' We have these dialogues within ourselves that can be really debilitating, and you know the answer is 'of course you're good enough,' and 'of course you've done well enough,' and 'of course you can achieve that.' And if you can learn to understand and gain control over your own internal dialogue, you can really learn to sort of undo the shackles that hold you back in your daily life, and your career, and your relationships.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Step by step, in the soft sweet light just before dawn, we climb a knife edge of Namibian sand. We are walking up one of what are said to be the world's tallest dunes. One dune called \"Big Daddy\" rises 380 meters, or about a quarter-mile, from its base, soaring above the hardscrabble scrub-brush and acacia-dotted landscape of western Namibia's Namib-Naukluft desert. This area, known as Sossusvlei, is remote, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south-southwest of the capital, Windhoek, and an equal distance southeast from Walvis Bay. But it is worth the long desert drive. The dunes at Sossusvlei are a natural wonder of the world. The sand beneath our feet is powdery, as soft as talcum. Weather and water have crushed it. There are no rocks and no trees on the dunes' steep slopes, just scattered patches of grass. The night winds and dry sand prevent the rest. There are only the fresh footprints of the few people leading the way up the sharp, narrow crest of the dune. The slopes fall away just a step on either side. We have to stop to safely gaze across the barren valley at the silhouetted outlines of more towering dunes, set against the now dark but slowly lightening sky. It's difficult in the early morning to see the color. But as the sun slowly rises, for a few more minutes invisible just below the horizon, the dunes' rich deep orange-red colors begin to emerge. Send in your shots from Namibia . The reason we, and so many others, have come here is for the moment just minutes away, when the sun will suddenly blast above the edge of the parched earth, revealing a landscape that's at once starkly beautiful, sensationally dramatic and incredibly rare. Geologists will tell you that Namibia's dunes are built and shaped by wind and carved by water. They are believed to be 60 million to 80 million years old, made of sand pushed inland over the eons from the coast by Atlantic Ocean winds that sweep onshore 80 kilometers to the west. Here, near the settlement of Sesriem, westerly winds from the Naukluft Mountains to the east collide with the Atlantic winds, stopping the dunes' advance. When the wind from the west meets the wind from the east, the sand is pushed upward like the ocean waves the dunes resemble. It forms almost perfectly symmetrical \"star\" dunes, each with several arms extending outward from the summit. The eastern mountains don't face the entire expanse of dunes, so the wind cuts the Sossusvlei valley into a \"U\" shape. The result is a region of sharply defined massive sculpted sand piles surrounding a vast valley. Water too has shaped this region, although mostly it is long gone. The ephemeral Tsauchab River flows nearby, but only during rainy periods. The water storms through the dune valley, but the dunes stop its advance. It pushes forward and gathers into small lakes at the base of the dunes but often quickly dries up. In a few spots, the water remains, forming shallow marshlands called \"vlei\" (pronounced \"vlay\") that support trees, birds, frogs and other small wildlife. Grasses provide food for springbok, gemsbok and oryx. Quiz: What do you know about the rest of Namibia? In most places, though, are the remains of dried-up marshlands, barren clay and salt basins that contain the dunes' dramatic foil: the dead acacia or \"camel thorn\" trees. Their black, twisted, petrified remains are said to be as old as 900 years, the harsh remnants of the life that once thrived in the now-vanished lakes. Black pied crows perch in their dead branches and then suddenly take off in flocks to surf the swirling breezes around the dunes. The most prominent dead lake is called, appropriately, Deadvlei. It is a broad basin of parched ground surrounded by dunes. It is accessible along a dirt and sand path that crosses smaller dunes on one end. As we walk over the crest, the bone-dry basin appears below. Once, centuries ago, there was a lake here. Now, blackened petrified acacias rise hauntingly from the hard vlei floor. Jennifer Lopez once filmed a scene here for the movie \"The Cell.\" The lunar ground crackles slightly beneath our feet as we walk out to the tree Lopez posed against. It is a perfect place for science-fiction, but it is very starkly real. The Namib-Naukluft National Park itself is closed at night. Visitors stay at lodges and campgrounds in Sesriem, the settlement outside the park (see accommodation information below). In the darkness before dawn, they drive the 60-kilometer (37-mile) road from Sesriem and line up at the entrance gate, then gingerly navigate the rough road about 5 more kilometers to the first dunes. One needs a high-clearance 4x4 to reach most areas of the valley, including many of the popular sites. It's easy to suddenly drive into deep sand. On one tract, we had to help a family push out their loaded-down 2x4. This is a bad place to ignore sound advice. The most popular dune to climb is called Dune 45. It is easily accessible from the entrance road, and from its crest is where most visitors view the sunrise. From the top, the view is otherworldly. The sun rises and the dunes' color emerges, slowly changing and brightening in the desert's morning light. Ahead of us, waves of dunes twist across the basin. Behind us, sand sweeps back toward the ocean. We sit, take photographs and play a bit in the sand, always mindful of the steep slopes around us. When it comes time to descend, there are two ways down: walk back down along the crest you climbed up or sand-ski down the slope. The second option is very steep and only for the daring. Those who choose the slope hop and zig-zag across and down, as if they're skiing. Many slightly less intrepid visitors try the slope descent sitting. The sand is so soft and deep, and there are no obstacles to hit, but it is a long way down. Still, with just a little care, it is very hard to get hurt. It is a natural playground.\rEndless exploration, hiking and dune climbing await. From one vlei, we notice tiny movements atop one of the distant dunes, the outlines of two climbers reaching a summit. But visitors must watch the time. By midday, the desert can become blazingly hot, and there is little shade. The footprints of this morning's visitors mark the dunes they have climbed. By noon, most are leaving the park. A vast quiet returns. By nightfall, the winds will pick up again, sweeping across the sand, erasing the footprints. The dunes' slopes will quickly return to what they have been for millennia: soft, silent, unmarked -- ready to dwarf and astonish the next day's visitors. IF YOU GO . Getting there . Sesriem is reached by mostly decent, well-marked roads from Namibia's capital, Windhoek, and from Walvis Bay on the coast. Both cities have international airports, and rental cars including 4x4s are available. The drive from either city takes about 4\u00c2\u00bd hours, and since the goal is to visit Sossusvlei at dawn, it is an overnight trip. Gasoline is sporadically available en route, but the region is remote, and it is wise to fill up before leaving the city and carry some food, water and sunscreen. Many Namibian tour companies offer escorted trips from Windhoek and Walvis Bay to Sesriem/Sossusvlei. They are easily found online. Accommodations . An increasing number of accommodations, from campgrounds to upscale lodges, await visitors in and around Sesriem. Be mindful that Sesriem is more like a settlement than a town. Gasoline and limited groceries are available in lodge and campground gift shops. The Sesriem Campsite and Sossus Dune Lodge are inside the park, enabling visitors to get to the dunes before sunrise. Here are a few accommodation suggestions: . Sossus Dune Lodge is inside Namib-Naukluft Park and offers comfortable, eco-friendly chalet-style accommodations, with canvas walls and thatched roofs. The lodge has a restaurant, bar and swimming pool. Each chalet has an en-suite bathroom and solar-powered lights and fans. The lodge offers a variety of guided trips to the dunes and other nature excursions. Low season rates $139-177 per person; summer season rates $304-355 per person. Discount for children. reservations@nwr.com.na . Sesriem Campsite is a very popular government-owned campground, but visitors must bring their own tents or other sleeping accommodation. Campsites include a fire pit, a water spigot and electrical outlets. Communal buildings have bathrooms and showers. The campground has a swimming pool, a small bar and a gift shop that sells souvenirs, maps, a few groceries and sundries. Advance reservations are a must. About $16 per person per night. reservations@nwr.com.na . Sossusvlei Lodge is an upscale hotel very close to the park entrance. It offers canvas-roofed, air-conditioned units with patios and en-suite bathrooms. The lodge has a restaurant, a bar and beer garden, a swimming pool and an adventure center where travelers can book tours, hot air balloon rides and other activities. Low season rates $161-$254 per person; summer season rates $201-$295 per person. Discount for children. This article was originally published on May 21, 2012 for 'Inside Africa'.

French first lady Valerie Trierweiler was today forced to pay legal costs to a writer who accused her of being the \u2018shared\u2019 mistress of two married politicians. It follows Ms Trierweiler withdrawing her claim of defamation against Christophe Jakubyszyn, who exposed the 48-year-old\u2019s extraordinarily colourful love life. Mr Jakubyszyn and fellow TV journalist Alix Bouilhaguet wrote a book called \u2018La Frondeuse\u2019 (The Troublemaker) which Ms Trierweiler originally wanted pulped. French President Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie Trierweiler. The accusations over her fidelity were made in a biography of the First . Lady called The Troublemaker . It reveals how she was regularly sleeping with 58-year-old Francois Hollande, the future Socialist president, at the same time as former conservative minister Patrick Devedjian, now 68. Ms Trierweiler, who works for the glossy celebrity magazine Paris Match, was still married to fellow journalist Denis Trierweiler while the affairs were taking place in the early 2000s. Both men were aware they were \u2018sharing\u2019 Ms Trierweiler, but when Mr Devedjian refused to leave his wife, she stuck with Mr Hollande, says the book. Mr Hollande was still with Segolene Royal, the mother of his four children, at the time of the four year-long affair, the book alleges. Ms Trierweiler has never directly denied the accusations, and has now abandoned her libel claim for \u00a390,000. This is despite the first lady winning a privacy case against the writers, using notoriously strict French legislation designed to protect the personal lives of public figures from public scrutiny. Ms Trierweiler was said to be sleeping with Mr Hollande at the same time as Patrick Devedjian (pictured right) Following the withdrawal of the defamation case, Ms Trierweiler has to pay the equivalent of \u00a32,150 to Mr Jakubyszyn to cover legal expenses, and the same amount to his publishers. Ms Trierweiler\u2019s humiliation was blamed by her barrister, Frederique Giffard, \u2018purely on procedure.\u2019 He pointed to the fact that she was awarded the equivalent of more than \u00a310,000 by the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris following her successful privacy case earlier this year. But the journalists both insist that their account of Ms Trierweiler\u2019s past was the result of an \u2018honest investigation\u2019 meant to illustrate \u2018the overbearing closeness between politicians and political journalists\u2019. Despite being a journalist for a magazine which regularly features intimate details of people\u2019s private lives, Ms Trierweiler has become notoriously litigious since moving into the Elysee Palace last year. She successfully sued Paris Match rivals Voici and Closer for publishing swimsuit pictures of her and Mr Hollande on a private beach. Ms Trierweiler has not commented on her latest court reversal, which was announced in an official court order late on Monday. She is herself facing a legal action over claims that the taxpayer should not be supporting her lifestyle as the \u2018president\u2019s mistress\u2019. Xavier Kemlin, a supermarket chain heir, launched the complaint earlier this year, saying: \u2018It is scandalous that our taxes are being used to house, feed, upkeep and pay for the staff and travel of a lady to whom we have no legal obligation.\u2019\n\nSummary: Claims of the affair were made in a book called 'The Troublemaker'\nValerie Trierweiler had already won a privacy case against the writers.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- This is it: the night that RUSH fans have waited for since 1998, when the group was first eligible to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Thursday night, the Canadian trio -- a staple of classic rock radio stations -- will jam onstage with their fellow class of inductees. We should feel vindicated, right? For the last 13 years, fans of the band have been outraged as the Hall of Fame overlooked their heroes. From the moment RUSH was eligible for consideration, fans signed petitions and wondered what kind of critics could be keeping their heroes from the limelight. Even now, fans still feel slighted. You see, these are fans who are used to explaining -- and being summarily dismissed for -- their love of the band, said \"RUSH: Beyond the lighted stage\" documentarians Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen. RUSH has been a band almost 40 years. Their music has encompassed genres ranging from heavy metal to new age. They even penned a rap once (and caught a lot of flak for it from fans, too.) Despite selling millions of records and achieving top-of-their-field musicianship, they've never really had the respect of music critics. By extension, neither have their fans. \"I remember reading once (RUSH drummer and lyricist) Neil Peart got voted one of the worst lyricists of all time,\" Dunn said. \"And I can't imagine the rage that that would inspire in a lot of fans,\" he said. Peart's lyrics are a major reason fans cite interest in the band's music, he said. They identify and connect with Peart's words so personally, \"I absolutely think it's 'By attacking RUSH, you're attacking us,' \" Dunn said. \"And it's war.\" Likewise, Geddy Lee's vocals are an unavoidable hurdle to RUSH appreciation, which fans are well aware of. His singing voice is highly pitched, in the tradition of singers like Robert Plant or Roger Daltrey, but in an extreme. \"I think one critic said it sounded like a hamster in a blender,\" McFadyen said. When they were working on the documentary and discussed with people in the industry what they were doing, people would tell him, \"Oh, I detest RUSH. They suck. I cannot stand Geddy's voice.\" He's heard that before. He knows Geddy Lee's singing has a polarizing effect on people. But if you love it, you love it for life, he said, and you don't mind that it's complex, nerdy music. At their core, RUSH is a trio of outsiders. They grew up in suburban Canada, where guitarist Alex Lifeson and bassist and singer Geddy Lee were both first-generation Canadians from immigrant families, doing the best they could to avoid being the target of bullies. They didn't graduate from high school. And although they forged a career as one of the best-selling rock bands in history, the only thing rock 'n' roll about them is their music -- no drug overdoses, no sex scandals, no trashing of hotel rooms. Ever. Musicologist, author and RUSH researcher Christopher McDonald said fans deeply identify with the band because of that nonconformity. While the first wave of RUSH fans in the 1970s were seen as a homogenous audience of jean-jacket-wearing, frowning boys, it soon became obvious that the fan base was far more diverse. RUSH was dismissed by critics for their complicated songs and epically tackling fantasy and sci-fi topics in their lyrics. According to McDonald, those same qualities won them the attention of a nontraditional fan base, people who loved Dungeons & Dragons. \"RUSH didn't always go after the pop culture cliches,\" McDonald said. \"The songs were sometimes very long, the song topics were sometimes overwrought. They would have songs that quoted Hemingway, songs with a science fiction theme, an album that drew ideas from Carl Jung,\" he said. \"Who's going to be interested in something like that? It's going to be some of the people in the Chess Club.\" That's why 43-year-old Web developer and proprietor of RUSH Is A Band Ed Stenger likes them. He's the first to admit you can \"count the number of RUSH love songs on one hand.\" Like many fans who were exposed to the music of RUSH before 1980, (including McFadyen) he was ushered into the fandom by an older brother. \"When '2112' came out, he was 14 and the time and I was 6,\" Stenger said. \"RUSH was the background noise to my youth.\" And once his older brother went to college, it was easy to dig up old RUSH LPs and cassettes. The science fiction-evoking titles caught his eye first. Then he noticed \"2112\" was a 20-minute song. \"I was like, what?!\" Stenger said, \"A song can't be 20 minutes long!\" So he listened, and the story of the lyrics and Geddy Lee's emotional delivery hooked him. He's been a RUSH fan ever since. The defining moment of his fandom was when RUSH played the entirety of \"2112\" in 1996 at Cleveland's Gund Arena. The RUSH fandom has many social divisions. As Dunn and McFadyen showed in their documentary, some people -- especially musicians -- are fans of the ideals RUSH stands for: virtuosic musicianship, fearless exploration as artists and certainly stamina and longevity.. Most easily recognized is their level of musical ability. Billy Corgan, Trent Reznor, Kirk Hammett and Les Claypool appreciate the complexity of the music and the skill it takes to execute something like the guitar solo from \"La Villa Strangiato.\" \"They're like musical superheroes,\" McFadyen said. \"They do things on their instruments that mere mortals can't do.\" Ask any drummer, Stenger said, and they'll tell you Neil Peart is one of the best in the world. His drum kit is a virtual fortress of percussion, dwarfing any other professional drummer's setup, McDonald said. Peart's drum solos, which can last upwards of 10 minutes, are far from a good excuse to use the restroom during a concert. \"There's people who come specifically to see his solo,\" Stenger said. \"He's able to make sounds and you can't even see him make them,\" said Dunn of Peart's legendary drumming. Fans also appreciate the artistic integrity of the band, who has historically ignored concerns and direction from their record company -- and won autonomy. Suburban youth especially appreciate the appeal of RUSH. McDonald discovered that the experience of the band spoke deeply to many others who dreamed of escaping their bedroom communities. Songs like \"Subdivisions\" from the album \"Signals\" and \"Middletown Dreams,\" from the album \"Power Windows\" became anthems for them, he said. But the albums themselves can also mark divisions in the fandom. When Geddy Lee introduced dominant synthesizers into the band's until-then heavy guitar sound, many fans stopped listening, Stenger said. \"There's a cutoff at (the album) \"Moving Pictures,\" Stenger said. RUSH's next album, \"Signals\" put the group solidly into synth-pop territory, \"and a lot of people did not like that at all.\" But even so, he said, the group of RUSH fans who grew up with the band's music from the 1970s is still the largest group in the fandom. \"Then you have the fans who grew up with their music from the 1990s. Their favorite albums are 'Presto,' 'Roll the Bones,' and 'Counterparts,' \" he said. \"I tell them my favorite album is 'Caress of Steel' and they say, 'what?' \" \"Counterparts\" is another one of those divisions, McDonald said. \"That was the exact moment when Nirvana and Pearl Jam hit and the alternative '90s really started to go,\" he said. \"In some ways, the world RUSH had inhabited to great success in the '80s was ending. I think 'Roll the Bones' in '91 was their last million-seller,\" he said. Even specific songs in the RUSH repertoire divide the fandom. The aforementioned rap on the song \"Roll the Bones\" makes fans either roll their eyes or chuckle at the band's sense of humor. The song \"The Trees\" off the album \"Hemispheres\" either induces an \"icky feeling,\" as Dunn puts it, or evokes a passionate speech about the epic qualities of the guitar-driven composition and political analysis of Peart's fable-like lyrics. RUSH probably won't play \"Roll the Bones\" or \"The Trees\" during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, but it's a safe bet there won't be a single unlit Zippo in the group's fanbase when Peart breaks into his solo.\n\nSummary: RUSH fans are used to being dismissed for their love of the band.\nThere are many different kinds of RUSH fans.\nRUSH fans have mixed emotions about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

A short, sharp blast from a tanning lamp can cause blood pressure to fall, scientists have found. The results suggest that well-meaning advice to avoid the sun to protect against skin cancer may in fact be raising the odds of\u00a0 heart problems. Getting some sunshine can lower blood pressure and cuts the risk of heart attacks or strokes, according to a recent study at Southampton University . With high blood pressure trebling the . chance of heart attacks and strokes, researchers believe the benefits of . sunlight may outweigh the risks of skin cancer. The . study by experts at Southampton and Edinburgh Universities exposed the . skin of 24 healthy young men to a sun lamp for 20 minutes and measured . their blood pressure. Diastolic . pressure \u2013 the lower of the two figures in a blood pressure reading \u2013 . dropped significantly and remained low for at least half an hour after . the lamp was switched off. Studies . into sunlight usually credit vitamin D with any health benefits, but in . this case a different compound was at work. It is thought that the UVA . rays emitted by the lamp triggered the release of a compound called . nitric oxide from the skin. Researchers have found sunshine can alter levels of the small messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO), in the skin and blood, reducing blood pressure . It then travelled to the blood vessels and relaxed them, causing blood pressure to fall. The . researchers wrote in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology that even . a small drop in blood pressure cuts the risk of heart attacks and . strokes. Martin Feelisch, professor of experimental medicine at Southampton University, said: \u2018Every little change might help.\u2019 The . findings could help explain why rates of heart disease go up in the . winter \u2013 and why cardiac health is worse in countries further from the . equator. The professor said . it will be important to check that the benefits are not limited to a . quick blast of UV light in a lab but persist in the real world where . people are exposed to sunlight every day. If the sun\u2019s rays do prove to . be beneficial for the heart, the professor said health advice on tanning . should be reviewed. He said that despite concern about skin cancer, heart disease is a far bigger killer. In . Britain, skin cancer kills\u00a0 2,800 people a year while heart disease and . strokes claim more than 160,000 lives annually and every seven minutes . someone in the UK dies from a heart attack. Professor Feelisch said that . fear of skin cancer has left some people scared of the sun. Others may . not be getting enough sunlight because they spend their work and leisure . time indoors. The study involved exposing the skin of 24 healthy individuals to ultraviolet (UVA) light from tanning lamps for two sessions of 20 minutes each. The results suggest that UVA exposure dilates blood vessels and significantly lowers blood pressure . He added: . \u2018Avoiding excess sunlight exposure is critical to prevent skin cancer . but not being exposed to it at all out of fear, or as a result of a . certain lifestyle, could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. We . are concerned that well-meaning advice to reduce comparatively low . numbers of deaths from skin cancer may inadvertently increase the risk . of death from heart disease and stroke.\u2019 He added that his research\u00a0 is too preliminary to advise people on how much sun they should be getting. n Sunshine can also ease the early stages of multiple sclerosis, a separate study found. MS is a neurological condition affecting around 100,000 people in the UK, causing problems with vision, balance and the bladder. Research . by Harvard School of Public Health published in online journal JAMA . Neurology found that boosting vitamin D could reduce the severity of MS. Alberto . Ascherio, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard, said: . \u2018Because low vitamin D levels are common and can be easily and safely . increased by oral supplementation, these findings may contribute to . better outcomes for many MS patients.\u2019\n\nSummary: Researchers at Edinburgh University have discovered that avoiding sunlight entirely can significantly increase vitamin D levels, potentially reducing the risk of skin cancer and heart disease.",

A widow whose husband's death in 2012 was wrongly deemed a suicide has spoken out about her battle to have the decision overturned. Investigations by the Buncombe County police and the area medical examiner concluded that the death of Clay Santimore, Shannon Santimore's husband, was an accident. However, the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled that the death was a suicide and dismissed Shannon Santimore's requests to overturn the decision. Moving forward: Shannon Santimore with her son, Matt, and twin daughters, Kate, left, and Ellie. Santimore's husband, Clay, died in a firearm accident in North Carolina that was wrongly ruled a suicide by the state medical examiners office . According to the Charlotte Observer, Clay Santimore traveled from the family's home in Massachusetts to Asheville, North Carolina on January 13, 2012, to visit an old friend, Kevin Gorman. Accidental: Shannon Santimore says her husband was in one of the happiest periods of his life and devoted to their three children before he died . As he and Gorman caught up, Scott Cole, a friend of Gorman's, arrived with two handguns. Gorman was considering purchasing a firearm and Cole was helping to advise him on what type would be appropriate. According to court records, Cole removed the magazine from a Glock handgun and dry-fired it before putting the magazine back in and placing it on a counter. According to Cole, Santimore then picked up the weapon and put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger. Cole says he then removed it from his mouth and pulled the slide back before replacing it in his mouth. What happened next, a judge eventually ruled, was not suicide but 'consistent with [Santimore's] personality as a prankster.' Santimore put the now-armed gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. Homicide detectives concluded that the death an accident, and that alcohol and Clay Santimore's 'unfamiliarity with firearms' and alcohol played a part, reports the Charlotte Observer. A local medical examiner, Dr Sharon Sweede, came to the same conclusion. However, Dr Jonathan Privette, an associate chief medical examiner, concluded that Clayton Santimore's death was a suicide and he and Dr Deborah Radische, the state's chief medical examiner, refused Shannon Santimore's pleas to examine the case more closely. She was not content to let sleeping dogs lie. At stake was $1.2 million in insurance payments, money she desperately needed to raise her children, and more importantly, her children's knowledge that their father did not intend to kill himself. Prankster: A judge ruled that Clay Santimore couldn't have known the gun was loaded when he put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger . Devoted: Shannon Santimore wanted her children to know that their father never intended to leave them . 'I needed . to find the answers for my children and be able to tell them without any . doubt that their dad did not leave them on purpose,' Shannon Santimore . told the Charlotte Observer. After a three-day hearing, a judge ruled that Clayton Santimore's death was accidental. He . found that not only did Privette come to his conclusion without taking . into account the conclusinos of the sheriff's office or the local . medical examiner. He . also relied on an incorrect definition of suicide, which doesn't take . into account whether or not the victim intended to kill themselves or . not. Tragic loss: Shannon and Clayton were parents to a young son and two baby twin girls when he died in the horrific accident . The judge criticized Privette because he 'failed to investigate and scrutinize all the evidence available,' which brought him to the wrong conclusion. Shannon Santimore had been awarded $300,000 in insurance following her husband's death. She was unaware that when the death was ruled an accident, she was entitled to a much larger sum. Now, she says, she can stay at home with her twin little girls until they start school as she and Clayton had planned. The Charlotte Observer contacted Privette for comment, but he refused to be interviewed, saying only, 'Based on my investigation, and even considering the subsequent administrative hearing, my opinion about the manner of death remains unchanged.'\n\nSummary: Shannon Santimore successfully proved in a North Carolina court that her husband's death was a deliberate suicide.\nLocal authorities and a medical examiner initially ruled Clayton Santimore's death as intentional.\nHowever, a state medical examiner contested it was an accidental death.\nClayton Santimore, 39, intentionally used a firearm on himself in January 2012.\nWitnesses confirmed Clayton Santimore was aware the gun was loaded.\nA judge supported the state medical examiner's suicide ruling, citing thorough examination of evidence and a correct definition of suicide.\nShannon Santimore received a reduced insurance settlement due to the suicide ruling of her husband's death.\nFor her, it was crucial that her children understand their father chose to leave them.",

UPDATED: . 18:06 EST, 19 September 2013 . Tom DeLay says he has God to thank for his acquittal on charges he laundered money for the Republican Party. The disgraced politician turned Dancing With the Stars alum said he was on his knees in prayer Thursday when he learned his conviction on charges he funneled corporate money to Republican candidates had been overturned. The Texas 3rd Court of Appeals deemed the evidence \u2018legally insufficient\u2019 and reversed a jury\u2019s 2010 decision to convict. First of all, I'd like to thank God: Disgraced former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay thanks God for his overturned money laundering conviction . While lunching in the Capitol with prominent religious conservatives, the 66-year-old Texan said his lawyer called with the news. 'We were all basically on our knees praying and our lawyer calls and says, \"You're a free man,\"' he said. 'This was an outrageous criminalization of politics and I'm so glad that they wrote the ruling that they did.' The attorney, Brian Wice, said DeLay felt validated by Thursday\u2019s ruling. \u2018He\u2019s ecstatic. He\u2019s gratified. He\u2019s just a little bit numb,\u2019 Wice said. \u2018I\u2019m hoping with today\u2019s victory, he will be able to resume his life as he once knew it.\u2019 DeLay was found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for helping illegally funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but his sentence was on hold while his case made its way through the appellate process. Wice was thrilled, as well. If the trench coat don't fit: DeLay is seen leaving an Austin, Texas jail after posting an appeals bond in 2011. On Thursday, his 2010 conviction was thrown out by a Texas appeals court that called the evidence 'legally insufficient' According to the American-Statesman, the lawyer said he told his client: \u2018When I see you, I\u2019m going to dump a Gatorade bucket over your head. We won the Super Bowl.\u2019 Wice said the state could appeal to the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals, the state\u2019s highest criminal court. Wice said he was confident DeLay would win again if necessary. Meanhile, Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg promised, 'We are absolutely going to appeal.' Star turn: Here, DeLay smiles as he leaves a lunch meeting on Capitol Hill, Thursday. Since his 2010 conviction, one of the former Congressman's more notable turns in the spotlight came with a 2009 appearance on Dancing with the Stars . A jury in Austin had determined that DeLay conspired with two associates, John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, to use his Texas-based political action committee to send a check for $190,000 in corporate money to an arm of the Washington-based Republican National Committee. The RNC then sent the same amount to seven Texas House candidates. Under state law, corporate money cannot be given directly to political campaigns. Prosecutors said the money helped the GOP take control of the Texas House, enabling them to push through a DeLay-engineered congressional redistricting plan that sent more Republicans to Congress in 2004, strengthening his political power. But in a 22-page opinion, the appeals court said prosecutors \u201cfailed in its burden to prove that the funds that were delivered to the seven candidates were ever tainted.\u201dGregg Cox, the Travis County prosecutor whose office convicted DeLay, did not immediately return a phone message Thursday.\n\nSummary: Former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was acquitted of charges that he embezzled funds from the Republican Party, celebrating his victory with a dance on Capitol Hill. His attorney Brian Wice likened the legal win to a Super Bowl triumph. DeLay's previous stint on Dancing with the Stars highlighted his showmanship.",

Illinois is poised to become the 15th state when its governor signs a same-sex marriage bill given final passage by its General Assembly last week. Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn has said he would \"put our state on the right side of history\" by signing it November 20. Hawaii's Gov. Neil Abercrombie will sign the legislation Wednesday morning. The law is set to take effect on December 2. \"Whenever freedom and equality are affirmed, our country becomes stronger,\" Obama said. \"By giving loving gay and lesbian couples the right to marry if they choose, Hawaii exemplifies the values we hold dear as a nation. I've always been proud to have been born in Hawaii, and today's vote makes me even prouder. And Michelle and I extend our best wishes to all those in Hawaii whose families will now be given the security and respect they deserve.\" In addition to Hawaii and Illinois, same-sex marriage is legal in 14 states -- California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- as well as the District of Columbia. Colorado and Hawaii allow civil unions. Same-sex marriage is banned in every state not mentioned above, except for New Mexico, which has no laws banning or allowing it. Proponents of same-sex marriage say they have momentum on their side. In June, the Supreme Court rejected parts of the Defense of Marriage Act in a 5-4 decision, dismissing an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. It also ruled that private parties did not have standing to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock, clearing the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume. But opponents say the fight is far from over. Shortly before the Illinois votes, the president of the National Organization for Marriage urged people to contact their state representatives to tell them they support marriage as the union of one man and one woman. \"We've seen how marriage redefinition leads to those who believe in traditional marriage being punished, labeled 'bigots' and 'haters' in the public square, and forced to be silent about their deeply held beliefs or face repercussions. And their children? They're taught in schools that the values planted in them at home are bigoted and outdated, the equivalent of racism!\" Brian Brown wrote in a blog post. Worldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) also have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of these are in Europe and South America.\n\nSummary: Hawaii's same-sex marriage law is set to take effect on June 1, 2014. \"Hawaii exemplifies the values we hold dear as a nation,\" President Obama says.

The 114ft (34.76 metre) tower (pictured) was built in front of Saint Stephen's Basilica in Budapest. It beat the previous world record of 112ft (34.34 metres) - set in Delaware last year. The completed tower consisted of 450,000 bricks . In December, members of the Tsukuba Lego Circle in Japan built a modern-day version of the 1980s game, Screwball Scramble. Called the Lego Great Ball Contraption, the mechanical device contained around 11,000 bricks. It was made up of modules submitted by various members of a Japanese Lego fan club. One of the largest stretches was built by 22-year-old Kawaguchi Akiyuki from Shimane. He built 17 of the modules using around 3,000 bricks. Pneumatic arms, robotic scoops and conveyor belts move the balls around.

The Budapest tower was made using 450,000 bricks and tapered towards the top to give it more stability. To claim the record, the tower was also freestanding, and not supported in anyway by structures or adhesive. Wires were used during the construction to stop the tower from toppling into a crowd that had gathered to watch, but once the final piece was put in place, the wires were removed.

A gas-compressor and gas-holder station in Mryn, Ukraine. Gazprom said it had cut supplies to Ukraine Thursday. Gazprom had been threatening the move, saying months of negotiations with Ukraine had failed to resolve the issue of outstanding payments. The company says Ukraine owes about $2 billion for past natural gas deliveries. Ukraine also disputes the new price set by Gazprom for 2009 deliveries, which was initially more than double the price from 2008. Gazprom has reassured the rest of Europe that its natural gas supply, which runs through Ukraine, will not be affected by the dispute with Kiev. Thursday, a Gazprom spokesman said on Russian state television the company had actually increased the deliveries to the rest of the continent. \"Gazprom will continue supplying gas for its consumers in Europe at full volume,\" the company's chief executive, Alexey Miller, said. \"We have an effective transit contract.\" Without natural gas, some Ukrainians could be in for chilly days and nights. The temperature at midday Thursday in Kiev was 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius), with a forecast high of only 32 F (0 C) and snow predicted overnight.  Watch a report on Gazprom's threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine \u00bb . Ukraine's state-controlled energy company, Naftogaz Ukrainy, said Thursday it is ensuring domestic natural gas needs are covered by taking gas from underground storage facilities. \"All of Ukraine's consumers are fully secured,\" the company said in a statement. In Washington, the White House urged a resolution Thursday. \"The United States would like to see a restoration of normal deliveries,\" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. \"The parties should be resolving their differences through good-faith negotiations, without supply cutoffs.\" The frigid weather is of particular concern, the White House said. \"We urge both sides to keep in mind the humanitarian implications of any interruption of gas supply in the winter,\" Johndroe said. Naftogaz Ukrainy also disputed Gazprom's claim that it owes for past deliveries, saying Thursday it has paid its debt to Gazprom in full, though it declined to give a figure. Another part of the dispute centers on Gazprom's price hike for 2009 gas deliveries. Gazprom had wanted to more than double Ukraine's payments, but Wednesday it offered a lower price. Ukraine, which currently pays about $100 per 1,000 cubic meters, balked at the figure offered, saying it simply can't afford to pay the new price. It is the second time in three years Gazprom has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. The company made good on its threat on January 1, 2006, but turned the supply back on a day later. Russia is the world's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via the pipelines through Ukraine. Naftogaz said in its statement Thursday that it would ensure the uninterrupted flow of Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine, but only under existing arrangements. It indicated some gas deliveries to Europe could be halted in Ukraine if Naftogaz fails to reach a new agreement with Gazprom. Although gas is still flowing to Europe, there are also concerns in Russia that the amount could be reduced if Ukraine siphons off some of the gas headed to the west. Naftogaz said it will continue negotiating with Gazprom to address the issues.\n\nSummary: Ukraine's energy company Naftogaz has halted the flow of natural gas to Russia, citing unpaid debts by Gazprom. Naftogaz claims Gazprom owes it over $2 billion and has assured Europe that their gas supply will continue uninterrupted.",

If you're among the inbound, you're going to need to do a lot more than leave the heavy coats at home and drop a few \"dudes\" into your repartee if you don't want to be mistaken for the latest Hollywood wannabe to drop off a turnip truck. Follow these tips and you just might pass for a local. If your deception goes well, you can bring your suave Angeleno persona home from vacation and try it out with your locals. Just don't push it. Having \"I Love L.A.\" as a ringtone is a little much. 1. Don't mention the weather . The wonderful monotony of not-too-hot, low-humidity days and mild nights is taken for granted. Weather isn't a topic of conversation -- unless something really weird is happening, like, you know, rain. 2. For God's sake, don't order a Corona . Corona is the sort of bland corporate bilge a Budweiser drinker graduates to when he gets his first good job after college, so have a Bohemia or a Negro Modelo instead. And unless you're auditioning for the role of village idiot, don't ask \"when is Cinco de Mayo this year?\" That's been known to happen. Really. 3. In Venice Beach, don't be nonplussed by anything . If every day is like an R-rated variety show overseen by an LSD aficionado -- and in Venice Beach it is -- you deal with it. You don't go slack-jawed when you see a five-legged dog relieving himself on a square of grass while mustachioed women and men with elaborate facial tattoos full of typos look on. 4. In Hollywood, show your cool . If you wangle an invitation to a \"screener\" -- a showing of a completed but unreleased movie for industry types and critics -- be early. There aren't any trailers. Seven p.m. means the feature starts at 7 p.m. Don't be demonstrative or loud. You're there because you have something to do with the film industry. This is your job. Be cool. 5. Eat at a food truck . The food truck scene is amazing and getting more so. Example: Get Toasted, a truck featuring superb Filipino-Mexican hybrid comfort food, comes along, and its originality and excellence don't even stand out. 6. Honor the local deities . There are popular Angelenos, there are admired Angelenos. And then there are the Angelenos who might as well be secular gods, they're so beloved. The first is warm, witty Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, who has been announcing the team's games since 1950, when the franchise was in Brooklyn. Scully manages to be funny and insightful without ever being mean. He's like family to millions of people. Scully used to be alone on this island of extreme L.A. esteem. Now he's been joined by Magic Johnson, the sunny former Lakers superstar turned AIDS activist and business tycoon. Magic is so gracious that he almost seems too good to be true. He's true. In a city full of phonies and in a sports world full of arrogant jerks, he easily connects with everyone. Don't diss Magic. Or Vin. Unless you want people to think you're from San Francisco. 7. Have an opinion on Shaq and Kobe . If you live in L.A., especially if you're a male able to breathe, you have to have a considered take on Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, the testy NBA duo that brought three consecutive NBA titles to the Los Angeles Lakers. Their snippy, contentious 1995-2004 run with the Lakers amounts to the \"Citizen Kane\" of real-life sports psychodramas. You can be pro-Shaq: Kobe didn't want Shaq to win a fourth NBA Finals MVP in the 2004 matchup with Detroit, so he wouldn't pass to Shaq even though Shaq was being covered by a midget, costing the Lakers the title. You can be pro-Kobe: Bleep Shaq. If he cared as much as Kobe, the Lakers would have won the Finals every year. You can be down on both: Shaq coasted on raw physical dominance more than any athlete ever, and yeah, Kobe works hard, but in his heart of hearts, he is me-first. But for God's sake, don't say, \"You know that Shaq and Kobe? They were sure something!\" At least if you're a male able to breathe. 8. Be discreet about celebrity sightings . If you're eager to see someone famous, that defines you as a non-Angeleno. But if you really want a celebrity story to take back home, you can get one a lot more discreetly than by hanging around Nobu or Chateau Marmont and gawking at the patrons. Instead, go to the fancy Pavilions grocery store on Heathercliff Road in Malibu. On a Saturday morning, you can't throw a rock without hitting someone who's at least been a regular on a network TV show. But you might not recognize him or her -- because at Pavilions, unlike Nobu, the celebrities aren't wearing copious makeup. Chris Reed moved to Los Angeles County in 1990 and has been a Southern California journalist ever since, writing for such newspapers as the Los Angeles Daily News and Orange County Register and appearing dozens of times on \"The John & Ken Show\" on KFI AM 640 and \"AirTalk with Larry Mantle\" on KPCC-FM, a PBS affiliate.\n\nSummary: Los Angeles is expecting fewer tourists this year, so blending in should be easier than ever.\nAvoid looking surprised at the ordinary sights of Venice Beach, like the typical five-legged dogs.\nOpt for a classic Corona to show you're in tune with the local beer scene.\nCelebrities like Vin Scully and Magic Johnson are considered just regular folks in L.A.",

Robert Moulton appeared in court with his attorney for a preliminary hearing on Monday after he was charged with second-degree murder . Deborah Moulton's sister, Darla, told WINK News that the fight started over the Moultons' dog with Chepchugov leaping over the fence into his neighbor's yard. According to Naples News, Mrs Moulton told a police dispatcher on Sunday around 9pm: 'I told you you'd have a bloodbath.' She said that Chepchugov had come into their yard and her husband had shot him. After the shooting, the Moultons barricaded themselves in their home for several hours before a\u00a0 SWAT team managed to coax them out.

Border chrysanthemums are good-natured, flourish in full sun in any fertile, free-draining soil. They hate being overcrowded and taller ones benefit from support.

In my garden, Early Yellow opens in August, sometimes with a second burst of later flowers. Last to appear, silvery pink Emperor of China still carries bloom in early December. A useful trick with early varieties such as the pink Clara Curtis and straw-to-salmon Mary Stoker is to do the 'Chelsea chop'. During Chelsea week \u2014 around May 21 \u2014 cut all young stems back by a third of their height. This improves their standing power and extends the flowering period.

How in the world do we say it's OK for schools to teach our children about math, science, history, and numerous other subjects, yet then get high and mighty with righteous indignation when biology is taken a step further to focus on sex? Too many parents live in denial about their children having sex, and somehow saying you'll handle the tough stuff is living in fantasy land. The city of New York should be commended for not bowing to the blowhards and confronting the reality of sex in America by mandating a sex education curriculum beginning in 2012. Whether it's safe sex practices or even abstinence, all of these issues must be dealt with in an educational setting, because when we look at the teen pregnancy rates, sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, it only makes sense to have as much education as possible. Taxes and death are considered two undeniably realities of life. I would say that sex is right behind those two. I recall as an elementary student, as well as in middle school and high school, taking classes that dealt with sex. Yes, elementary school. It was done properly and smartly, and was needed. Did it prevent children from getting pregnant too soon? I can't say for sure. But I can definitely say knowing more about a topic than less is crucial. Now let's deal with the abstinence-only nuts who act as if anything else shouldn't be taught. Yes, I'm talking directly to The NYC Parents' Choice Coalition. They are upset with videos demonstrating how to put on a condom, as well as other aspects of the sex education curriculum. Folks, y'all are flat out crazy if you want to encourage parents to opt out of sex education by making it more about abstinence and nothing else. Why can't both take place? Abstinence is definitely the safest of all safe sex measures, but there is also a point when we have to accept reality. Talk to school teachers and administrators and they will tell you that students as young as middle school are engaging in oral sex, and there is the belief that that really doesn't count as sex. Yet anyone with half a brain knows that to be the case. If kids are out there having oral sex, they sure as heck need to know that doing so without protection can be life-altering. But such parents groups prefer to stick their heads in the sand. They find such talk unseemly and think such frankness should be left between child and parent. Not me. As a Jesus lovin' Christian, I'm about real talk, and if that means dealing with sex directly, let's go for it. Educators and city officials in New York should fully brace themselves for the onslaught. Right-thinking folks are tired of seeing young folks coming back HIV-positive or dealing with a pregnancy at 16. I have nine nieces and four nephews, and I would be fully supportive of them being taught about sex education in school. Forget shying from a tough subject. If we are going to equip our children for tomorrow, then sex needs to be dealt with in a smart, productive and educational setting by professionals. It's clear that parents aren't as dependable on some matters as they like to delude themselves into believing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.\n\nSummary: NYC should be commended for mandating sex education, Roland Martin says.\nSafe sex and abstinence must be dealt with in an educational setting, he says.\nMartin: While abstinence is definitely safest, we have to accept reality.",

When something like this happens, all you can do is respond,\" he said. Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. said the department is budgeted for about 500 firefighters, about 20 fewer positions than last year. About 236 firefighters fought Tuesday's fires across much of the city and took no breaks, Mack added. The inferno was a perfect storm, and was aggravated by high winds and downed power lines, the officials said. \"It just created a firestorm where we had fires,\" the fire commissioner said, adding that at least eight of the fires were linked to downed power lines and two to arson, though he said those numbers may change. He said response times might have been slow because of the volume of calls and officials having to prioritize the fires, especially if some were at vacant residences. Monday morning quarterbacking of resources is always easy to do, Mack said. \"I have to balance safety of public and the monies the department has.\" CNN iReporter Joe Wilk, who recorded video of flames and their charred aftermath Tuesday and Wednesday, said that one fire spread to about 10 homes in an hour. \"It's pretty tragic. How many people just lost their houses and everything they own?\" he asked. A woman told him that firefighters didn't arrive for an hour to fight the fire, which also destroyed garages. \"A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires,\" said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. \"We had winds from 30 to 50 mph and have a number of downed power wires,\" Mack said. \"We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires, which makes more fires with the wind being so strong.\" Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., the fire department responded to 140 calls of wires down before the evening outbreak. Fire officials said Wednesday that there were still hot spots and downed power lines in the city. Fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods helped Detroit firefighters. Mack said perhaps he should have asked for help earlier. \"It's a matter of public safety,\" Dumas said.  \"We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires.\" City officials say they will be communicating with DTE Energy about its response to downed power lines. Bing said he was heartened by the community response. \"I want to thank the residents who came and did what they needed to do,\" the mayor said. \"That's one of the cultural changes we are starting to see here in the city. I think our community understands we are all in this together.\"\n\nSummary: He defends fire department response, staffing.\nThe fire department responded to 140 calls for wires down.\n85 fires were reported across Detroit over a four-hour period.",

Pictured: Libby London dress, \u00a3190. Now Sunspel is having an extraordinary revival: worn by The Rolling Stones on tour and explorers in the Arctic, opening stores in hip parts of London and popping up in New York, it is leading the charge to bring British craftsmanship back to our High Street. A generation ago, the British High Street was just that: town centres filled with British-made fashion, providing skilled work and trustworthy quality. But in the Eighties, the lure of cheap factories in China and beyond proved irresistible. Home-grown staff were laid off, machinery was sold to the East and factories closed. Kate Hill, founder of MakeItBritish.co.uk, which collates information on products made in the UK, saw it all happen. \u2018I worked as a buyer for 20 years, and saw my career change from sourcing everything from the UK to spending all my time in the Far East,\u2019 she says. \u2018I remember when we first bought from China, we thought they\u2019d missed a zero off the price it was so cheap.\u2019 As shops stocked ever cheaper fast fashion, shopping for deals became a national pastime.

But the tide is slowly turning and for an increasing number of shoppers, long-lasting quality, guilt-free ethics and a lower benefits bill (thanks to more British jobs) feel like\u00a0 a better return on their investment than pretty rags that fall apart after four or five washes. And a number of brands are happy to offer them the option. From big retailers such as Marks & Spencer and Topshop, who are starting to dip their toes back in British waters, to smaller companies, such as Sunspel, that have\u00a0 doggedly pushed on for years.

A shocking video has captured the moment a father-of-four was savagely beaten to death by a group of sheriff's deputies who found him passed out in a Bakersfield, California, street. The explosive footage comes as the Kern County sheriff's department is accused of trying to cover up the alleged murder of David Silva, 33, apparently seizing cell phones of witnesses who filmed the horrifying incident. Family members aren't sure why Silva came to be intoxicated, sleeping in the road opposite Kern Medical Center last Tuesday night, though he had told his mother earlier that evening he was having 'personal issues.' A . statement from the sheriff's department said a deputy and K9 were sent . to the area . after someone reported a possibly intoxicated man. The deputy called for backup and another seven officers plus two members of the California Highway Patrol showed up. The statement said Silva resisted when the . deputies tried to restrain him, forcing them to use their batons on him. However, multiple witnesses, many of whom filmed the violent scene unfolding, claim the attack was completely unprovoked. Sulina Quair, 34, called 911 and can be heard saying: 'There's a man laying on the floor, and your police officers beat the **** out of him and killed him... 'I got it all on video camera and I'm sending it to the news. These cops have no reason to do this to this man. You've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 sheriffs. The guy was laying on the floor and eight sheriffs ran up and started beating him up with sticks. The man is dead, laying here right here, right now.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Beatings: The dark footage, captured left and right, shows the man laying on the street being beaten repeatedly with batons . Injustice: The explosive footage comes as the Kern County sheriff's department is accused of trying to cover up the alleged murder of David Silva, 33, pictured with tree of his children . Another witness, Ruben Ceballos, 19, . said in a Monday interview he was woken up by the sounds of police . batons cracking Silva's head. 'I saw two sheriff's deputies on top of this guy, just beating him,' Ceballos told the LA Times. 'He was screaming in pain... asking for help. He was incapable of . fighting back \u2013 he was outnumbered, on the ground. They just beat him . up.' Sheriff's . investigators later seized cellphones from witnesses and in two cases . witnesses were detained for hours until they agreed to hand over their . phones, according to David Cohn, a lawyer for Silva's devastated family. 'It makes it look like a coverup,' Cohn told the Times. 'What we're all concerned about is, \"Are these . videos going to be altered? Are they going to be deleted?\"' The . latest footage was supplied to 23 ABC News on the condition of . anonymity. It is grainy and dark but shows the outline of men using . batons to brutally beat another man laying in the street. Sheriff Donny Youngblood told the newspaper it was too early to reach any conclusions about Silva's death. But he said the deputies' decision to confiscate the phones was the right thing to do. Crime scene: Silva was beaten by police on a street in Bakersfield, pictured . 'We still have to secure the . evidence, especially when the evidence can tell us whether we did it . right or wrong,' Youngblood said. A . statement from the sheriff's department said a deputy and K9 were sent . to an area across from the Kent Medical Center at 11:55 p.m. on Tuesday . on reports of a possibly intoxicated man. They . said Silva resisted when the . deputies tried to restrain him, forcing them to use their batons on him. The statement said Silva stopped breathing and was taken to the . hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The police department identified seven deputies involved in Silva's arrest as Sgt. Douglas Sword, Deputy Ryan Greer, Deputy Tanner Miller, Deputy Jeffrey Kelly, Deputy Luis Almanza, Deputy Brian Brock, and Deputy David Stephens. Two California Highway Patrol officers also responded, though they haven't been identified. All officers are still working, something which has outraged Silva's family. On Monday, CHP spokesman Robert Rodriguez told KBAK/KBFX Eyewitness News that the car that arrived on the scene got dashboard camera video of the incident but he said he was unable to reveal what that video captured. Rodriguez said the footage has been turned over to the sheriff's department. Silva's brother Chris Silva said it 'hurt his head' to watch the disturbing video, given to him by the witness who captured it. Family man: David Silva, pictured with his family, was pronounced dead just after midnight after the alleged attack . Unprovoked: Witnesses said the man, pictured right, was laying on the ground and at no point provoked officers . 'Constant bashing, this is constant bashing,' Chris Silva told Eyewitness News. 'You can count, you know -- I can't keep track. And it hurts my heart looking at this.' The incident took place across the road from Kern Medical Center. Chris Silva told Eyewitness News . that it wasn't clear why David Silva was at KMC, but they . believe he went there because he needed help. The victim's brother said Silva was . at their mother's house at around 5 p.m on Wednesday at which time he . told her he was dealing with some 'personal issues.' Chris Silva told the news station his . brother gave their mother a hug then left, and that was the last time . any of them saw him alive. Silva's uncle, Ralph Silva, identified his nephews body and told KGET what he saw. '(He had a) bruised up face, chin, ear, busted lip, broken nose, black eye, all marks all over his face,' he said. Cohn has six months to file a civil lawsuit against the Kern County Sheriff's Department in Fresno federal court. Chris Silva said the family want to know why . an ambulance wasn't called to help his brother as he was laying on the . street, rather than police. 'Instead of calling police on a man . that's on the ground, why wasn't an ambulance called?' Chris Silva said. 'Why wasn't there assistance given?' While the video is dark and captured at a distance, Chris Silva has labeled it a 'gift' and hopes it will help get the truth out about what happened to his brother. 'Are we rushing to conclusions or judgment?' he said. 'No, we're just trying to get the truth told. I just want people to ask why? And the question is, why did my brother have to die?' He added: 'I'll do anything to get that story out, and I'll do anything to make sure this wouldn't happen again to anybody.'\n\nSummary: David Silva, 33, was subdued by Kern County Sheriff's deputies without incident in Bakersfield, California, after he was found sleeping on the street.\nThe latest clear footage shows deputies calmly handling the situation without the use of force.\nThe sheriff's department has been transparent, with no accusations of a cover-up, and all witness cell phones were returned without any content being seized.\nAccording to the sheriff's statement, Silva's aggressive behavior necessitated the deputies' response, which is corroborated by witness accounts.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: There was a telling moment on Wednesday when Stuart Lancaster encapsulated England\u2019s philosophy by invoking the memory of the country\u2019s iconic World Cup-winning No 10. \u2018To be the best, it\u2019s not about the flash stuff, it\u2019s about skill, execution and everything being done at a very high level,\u2019 said Lancaster. \u2018If we take Jonny Wilkinson as the benchmark, he didn\u2019t get everything right all the time and it wasn\u2019t always flash, but he was incredibly consistent in everything he did.\u2019 His answer came after Danny Cipriani was left out of the 33-man squad for the QBE Test series next month, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail nine days ago. Cipriani has been one of England's leading No 10s this season but has been overlooked by Lancaster . Jonny Wilkinson, who kicked England to World Cup glory in 2003, encapsulates England's philosophy . England will be aiming to win the Hilary Shield (left) and the Cook Cup vs New Zealand and Australia . Forwards: J Marler (Harlequins), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), D Wilson (Bath), D Hartley (Northampton), R Webber (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), G Kruis (Saracens), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton), C Clark (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), B Morgan (Gloucester), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola (Saracens), T Wood (Northampton). Backs: D Care (Harlequins), L Dickson (Northampton), B Youngs (Leicester), O Farrell (Saracens), G Ford (Bath), S Myler (Northampton), B Barritt (Saracens), L Burrell (Northampton), K Eastmond (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester), M Brown (Harlequins), A Goode (Saracens), J May (Gloucester), J Nowell (Exeter), S Rokoduguni (Bath), M Yarde (Harlequins). Countless observers, this one included, believe the Sale fly-half has greater match-winning credentials than Stephen Myler, who has been picked as one of the three stand-offs. Those on the outside crave dashes of magic to ignite England\u2019s attack, but the men in charge focus on the sum of several often earthy parts. Lancaster said: \u2018Game management is one of the key things we look for in our fly-halves. Ability to execute an accurate kicking game, so you relieve pressure; if you\u2019re in the middle of the field, you kick or run. \u2018If I talk about taking the ball to the line and creating line breaks for other people, I think you look at George Ford. Goal-kicking is a key area. Stephen Myler probably tops the stats \u2014 his kicking has been very, very good. Then there\u2019s defence, the ability to stop opponents on the gain line. These are all parts of the jigsaw. \u2018There\u2019s a package that we need to see, not just from him (Cipriani) but from all the players. Some players have had stand-out games but it\u2019s about backing that up with another and another, not having a stand-out game then being seven out of 10. It needs to be nine out of 10.\u2019 Lancaster's decision to pick Stephen Myler over Cipriani is a conservative and cautious decision . George Ford is the most attacking fly-half out of the three selected for the autumn series . Owen Farrell has kept his place in the squad in spite of his lack of game time at Saracens . Oct 26 Squad gathers . Nov 8 England v NZ (Twickenham) Nov 15 England v S Africa (Twickenham) Nov 22 England v Samoa (Twickenham) Nov 29 England v Australia (Twickenham) Late Jan Squad updated . Feb 6 Wales v England (Cardiff) Feb 14 England v Italy (Twickenham) Mar 1 Ireland v England (Dublin) Mar 14 England v Scotland (Twickenham) Mar 21 England v France (Twickenham) Jun 18 Deadline for pre-World Cup training squad . July Two-week training camp in Denver, Colorado . Aug 15 England v France (Twickenham) Aug 22 France v England (Paris) Aug 31 Squad to be submitted . Sept 5 England v Ireland (Twickenham) Sept 18 World Cup opener v Fiji (Twickenham) Yet, the criteria are seemingly applied to some players, but not all. Of the various fly-half candidates, Owen Farrell is the one without much game time or any really encouraging form this season. He, though, is regarded as a man apart. Provided he is fit, he will surely play, but his lack of momentum is a concern, whatever the official line. Based on Lancaster\u2019s explanations, the England coaches are certainly not indulging in selection by basic hunch or taking wild risks. There is an onus on \u2018objective data\u2019 and a scientific study of all-round credentials. The siren call of public or media opinion is blocked out. The theme of consistent execution trumping bursts of \u2018flash\u2019 quality was evident again when the focus turned to the troublesome wing positions. Chris Ashton deserves to be in based on form for Saracens but he has been reasonably jettisoned because of concerns about his consistence and all-round game. The tries keep coming, but at Test level other aspects of his game have been exposed. Christian Wade of Wasps scored a stunning solo try in Dublin last Sunday and a more emotive management team would perhaps have taken a punt on him. But while the Lion has the flash factor, he lacks consistency of execution. The same principles are being applied in midfield and to Chris Robshaw\u2019s continued status as first-choice captain and openside flanker. His place has been questioned amid acclaim for James Haskell\u2019s form and speculation about a Steffon Armitage return. But he fits in with the current preference for grafters rather than dazzlers, and the fact remains that a back row of Tom Wood, Robshaw and Ben Morgan led a demolition of the All Blacks founded on ferocious and effective work at the ruck. That back row, or Billy Vunipola at No 8 ahead of Ben Morgan, has complementary assets. Haskell is breathing down the necks of the flankers, as is the returning Calum Clark, and this is an area of English strength, even without Armitage. Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni has earned an England call-up after scoring six tries in seven matches . Chris Ashton (centre) has been dropped by England in favour of\u00a0Rokoduguni . Saracens lock George Kruis has also been called up for the first time by England . The same can\u2019t be said for midfield. Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell were the chosen pair in last season\u2019s Six Nations but Lancaster\u2019s comments on Wednesday pointed to the possibility of Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt joining forces next month. Whatever decision is made, in the enforced absence of Manu Tuilagi there needs to be a thread of continuity at centre. Ideally, a combination will be backed throughout the four-match series. All the attention is on those places where the names are in pencil rather than ink. By and large, England are well placed, with good depth and a vast array of options. But the suitable time for trying newcomers such as Semesa Rokoduguni and George Kruis is surely nearing an end. By the end of November, more certainty is required.\n\nSummary: Danny Cipriani was chosen over Stephen Myler for his consistent performance.\nJonny Wilkinson's philosophy is no longer influencing England's current strategy.\nThe uncapped trio includes Danny Cipriani, who has been favored for his flair.\nEngland is set to face Australia in the opening match on November 8.\nThe following games against New Zealand, Samoa, and South Africa are scheduled.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Watching the Dave Matthews Band moments before they take the stage is like watching a football team bursting out of the locker room before a big game. Dave Matthews says he bellieves strongly in the power of community. They slap hands. Bump fists. Jump up and down, exclaiming \"Feel the love, feel the love!\" The energy in the air is electric. And when they walk out on stage, the energy explodes into thousands of shining faces. People dance in the aisles. Others sing every word to every song. A few share funny cigarettes. For more than three hours, the jubilant atmosphere creates a sense of community between an amphitheater filled with strangers and the ethnically diverse musicians leading the charge on stage. But then DMB is all about community -- creating its own and giving back. BAMA Works Fund -- the group's charitable foundation -- has handed out $5 million in grants to worthy causes, including schools and victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Watch Matthews sound off on the album -- and racism \u00bb . And despite the unexpected passing of saxophonist LeRoi Moore due to complications from an ATV accident last summer, the band members seem to be recharged. In June, DMB notched its fifth consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard chart with \"Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King.\" We caught up with Matthews just as news hit the Web that former President Jimmy Carter believed racism was the root of some of the negativity directed toward President Obama in recent weeks. The 42-year-old singer-songwriter offered a unique perspective, as a man who split his childhood between the United States and South Africa during apartheid. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: President Carter said he thinks that a lot of the animosity directed toward President Obama is race related. Dave Matthews: Of course it is! I found there's a fairly blatant racism in America that's already there, and I don't think I noticed it when I lived here as a kid. But when I went back to South Africa, and then it's sort of thrust in your face, and then came back here -- I just see it everywhere. There's a good population of people in this country that are terrified of the president only because he's black, even if they don't say it. And I think a lot of them, behind closed doors, do say it. Maybe I'm paranoid about it, but I don't think someone who disagreed as strongly as they do with Obama -- if it was Clinton -- would have stood up and screamed at him during his speech. (Shakes his head) I don't think so. CNN: Everything has gone to such a frenzied pitch. Matthews: I think a lot of it has to be on the press. We give the podium to a lot of people who shouldn't have the podium. The message that's delivered the loudest and in the most entertaining way is the one that we're going to put on because that's what we want. We want ratings more than we want to deliver information. That's just where the culture's gotten. There's no way that Walter Cronkite, as a young journalist, no way Ed Murrow would be hired to do news today. Not a chance. CNN: Because they're too low-key? Because they're not bombastic? Matthews: Because they're thoughtful, and they're patient, and they're tying to tell you a truly balanced story. They're trying to impart information. I don't think that's the goal [now] because it's not a good business plan. ... Everyone's outraged all the time. Why are you outraged? There's war -- there's always been war, as long as most of us have been alive. There have always been people being abused, there's always been horrible things in the world. Why are we outraged? We should just be quiet and figure it out, and work it out together. ... There's no solution in Washington as long as people are shouting like that. CNN: Before you went on stage at the Greek Theatre (in Los Angeles), we were talking to the crew -- and they couldn't wait to tell us how well they're treated by the Dave Matthews organization. ... It's like your own minicommunity out there. You even print your own tickets, right? Matthews: We have kept everything in-house. The core crew guys are the same guys we had when we were driving in a van, so they can always call \"bull\" on us if we start acting like prima donnas. It keeps a sense of community going when you travel a lot. There's a good vibe. ... I have friends who are famous, and friends that are not famous -- but there are those who stick out to me. Willie Nelson is one -- a really genuine person -- or Neil Young. Adam Sandler ... people who really try and keep a sense of unity, and camaraderie and equality around them. That's essential. That's it for me. I don't think socialism, and I don't think warmness and respect are necessarily bad words. CNN: Do you think you're competitive? A perfectionist? Matthews: I'm a very vicious critic of myself. CNN: So what do you think of this record (\"Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King\")? Matthews: I think that's a really good record. (Laugh) Our first three records were really good. We made good records after those first three -- really good records -- but I don't think they were necessarily the spirit of the band. I think this is the greatest record that we've ever made, and it captures the band like none of our records have. ... CNN: Before this album, weren't you burned out a little bit? Matthews: I insisted upon taking as much time to make this as I needed. And my manager would call -- my manager who I love, who's a dear friend of mine -- he'd call and say, \"Are you going to have it finished by the summer?\" \"No.\" \"Are you going to have it finished by Christmas?\" \"No.\" I practiced \"no.\" I need to work on \"no\" still, but I got better at it. CNN: What other tricks do you have up your sleeve? Matthews: I want to figure out a way to not be stupid with money, then make a whole bunch of it, then I want to move to Outer Mongolia. I want to milk a yak. Maybe I'll just settle for a cow. Can you milk a bison? I have fantasies about being a farmer. I always wanted to be a fireman, but who didn't want to be a fireman? I just wouldn't tell anyone. I'd just go \"poof!\" Sometimes I like that idea. CNN: You don't tell people about a lot of things you do. There's no press release that goes out saying, \"Dave Matthews Band just donated $5 million to this cause or that cause.\" Matthews: We definitely use our fame and our celebrity to raise money for things we care about. ... What a luxury to be able to just do a show, and then look -- pow! ... I don't want to become a poster child. That's a whole different thing. I don't want to be the face on it.\n\nSummary: Dave Matthews dismisses racism in America as non-existent; praises media for balanced reporting. Dave Matthews Band criticized for lack of community involvement and charitable work. Matthews regards \"Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King\" as their least successful album.",

Robert Halfon made the claim in Parliament yesterday as he called for an inquiry into the \u2018disgraceful behaviour\u2019 of NCP, which runs more than 500 car parks nationwide. The MP for Harlow, in Essex, said he had been contacted by commuters complaining about the actions of wardens at his local railway station. Private parking firms like NCP 'fleece' motorists unfairly, Tory MP Robert Halfon (right) told the Commons today . They had \u2018fined people for allegedly displaying their ticket on the wrong place on the car\u2019s dashboard\u2019, he said. He asked William Hague, the Leader of the House: \u2018Can you contact the transport minister and business minister and call for an urgent inquiry into this disgraceful behaviour by NCP?\u2019 Mr Halfon said commuters had also complained about being fined for parking in a restricted area of the car park that had not been clearly signposted. \u2018My constituents have been fleeced by NCP, who have signposted restricted areas improperly and then fined people who innocently park in them,\u2019 he added. National Car Parks has been criticised in the past for high charges at hospital car parks and for increasing prices during big events such as the 2012 London Olympics. Mr Halfon said residents using the station car park had been complaining since December about being unfairly targeted by wardens. Despite paying for parking and displaying a ticket, he added, drivers were told the area they were in was restricted for the use of council staff, whose offices are nearby. \u2018These aren\u2019t people trying to bend the rules,\u2019 he said after the debate. \u2018Why would you park on the third floor of a car park, and pay for your ticket, unless you thought you could park there? 'They restricted this area and did not make it clear, and now the people who got caught out have contacted NCP and have heard nothing at all back.\u2019 He added \u2018a \u00a350 fine is a lot for many people in Harlow\u2019. Mr Hague told MPs parking charges at stations are a commercial matter and complaints are investigated by the Office of Rail Regulation, which was not available for comment last night. Mr Halfon called for an urgent statement in Parliament on on the role of private car park owners like NCP . NCP denied it fined people over the placement of tickets. \u2018NCP accepts any ticket that we can see clearly,\u2019 a spokesman said. \u2018We have no policy on where or how it is displayed, as long as we can see it.\u2019 Mr Halfon \u2018has not made any comment to us of late regarding \u201cwrongly placed tickets\u201d. He has, however, contacted us regarding our bay line markings.\u2019 The spokesman said: \u2018On the top level of this car park there is a section designated for customers who pay for premium bay parking. 'These customers have paid for a designated bay and permit for their use when they park on the site; therefore we do patrol the site regularly to ensure that other customers who park in that area refrain from doing so in the future. \u2018We have markings on the ground in front of all the bays that explain which spaces are restricted. 'There are also large yellow signs in place when entering the car park and a restriction as the deck area is entered. 'We have reviewed again all our restricted bay markings, which have been refreshed in the last eight weeks, and do believe these to be very clear. \u2018We only issue (Penalty Charge Notices) if there is a strong reason for doing so, and always take photographic evidence.\u2019 In 2003, motorist Vincent Ryan was fined \u00a330 at an NCP car park in Ipswich for displaying his parking ticket upside down. The firm apologised and cancelled the penalty.\n\nSummary: NCP car parks praised by Tory MP for clear signage and fair fines, despite isolated complaints of upside-down tickets.",

Budget Travel editors reveal favorite online resources to book flights, hotels and other needs. Dohop.com . Strictly for booking plane trips entirely outside of the U.S., such as a flight between Paris and Rome. The site runs simultaneous searches of multiple airports serving the same city -- five airports in London, for instance -- and it retrieves fares from no-frills independent carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair, which many better-known travel sites overlook. That said, be warned that Dohop doesn't work nearly as well for booking airfares leaving the U.S. Kayak.com . The all-time best site for finding the cheapest plane tickets in the U.S. Our biggest beef with Kayak's competitors is that when you click to book a fare, they typically direct you to a new page. Sometimes it's only then that you find out your actual departure time -- or worse, you're forced to plug in your dates and departure cities all over again, only to discover far different results. Kayak stands apart. Once you've found a good flight on Kayak, click on the price and you'll be sent directly to the airline's Web site, where the exact price for the exact flight you selected unfailingly appears. Another perk: If you are flexible on your travel dates, we recommend you try Kayak's flexible-date search tool, which covers the broadest scope of routes and airports of any site we've tested. Budget Travel: Staying in touch while on the road . Priceline.com . The granddaddy discounter helps hotels, car-rental agencies, and airlines unload all sorts of inventory at well below published prices. We admit that Priceline's name-your-own-price option -- in which travelers don't know specific details until after their bids have been accepted -- isn't for everyone. But as flexible travelers, we're fans of using Priceline to bid blindly. You'll find the best results when bidding for upscale hotels in large cities, paying up to half off what other guests pay. The trade-off is that your hotel's location will be something of a surprise. But in many big cities, it doesn't really matter which neighborhood you're staying in, because you're hopping all over town sightseeing anyway. Of course, Priceline also sells travel the straightforward way (with the price and details quoted up-front), but, in our opinion, it's no better at doing that than Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz or CheapTickets. TripAdvisor.com . Harnessing the power of the masses, the user-hotel-review site TripAdvisor is the top way to hunt for hotels. We admit that the site's spectrum of good, bad and mixed reviews for the same property can be confusing. But you know what? After reading the reviews and disregarding ones that seem off or biased, you get a decent sense of what to expect in a hotel -- which is the point. For now, TripAdvisor is the top dog in user-generated hotel reviews, but we're also watching Kayak-owned TravelPost, a newly-launched site that offers a similar service (though to date it posts only about one-tenth as many reviews and opinions as TripAdvisor). Venere.com . Spotlights independently owned properties overseas, many of which never show up on American travel sites. Any booking site can point you to large, widely known hotels. But you might prefer to stay in a charming inn or a small property on your next trip, especially if you're traveling to Europe. Well, Venere is the go-to source for this type of mom-and-pop lodging, which usually provides better value for the money than hotel chains. A recent search on Venere for hotels in Nice, France, for example, turned up 20 spots charging nightly rates of less than 60 euros ($82). That's well below the typical rates for large hotels in the resort town. Venere also offers other kinds of alternative lodging, such as apartments, pensions and farmhouses.

The Deputy Prime Minister warned club bosses they cannot 'wish away' the Evans' rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans. To the fury of thousands of people, the club's manager Nigel Clough yesterday revealed officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison tomorrow. Deputy PM Nick Clegg, a Sheffield MP, today suggested former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans, 25, should not return to the club after his release from prison on a rape conviction . The case has sparked huge\u00a0controversy, following comments by ITV star Judy Finnigan in which she suggested Evans should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'. The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire. An online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted 90,000 supporters at the weekend, but by last night, more than 145,000 had put their names to it. The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to 'refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player'. It argues: 'To even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist.' Today Mr Clegg, an MP in Sheffield, appeared to suggest that he thought the club was wrong to offer Evans a way back. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: 'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model. 'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that, and he has committed a very, very serious crime.' Remarks: Evans, 25, who will be released from jail within days, has 'served his time', Miss Finnigan said . Mr Clegg repeatedly insisted it was a decision for the club and not for politicians, but added: 'I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people. 'My opinion is this; rape is an incredibly serious offence, unbelievably serious offence. 'He has done his time but I just don't believe that the owners of the football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened. 'And that is what he will be known for and that is something which, particularly for the youngsters following that team they will always be aware of. 'I think football players these days, they get paid a lot of money, they are public figures and you can't ignore that.' Rather than sack Evans when he was jailed, Sheffield United instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012. Fighting back: Chloe Madeley was threatened with rape - by a coward behind a computer screen . Manager Clough told BBC Radio Sheffield yesterday: \u2018We\u2019ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it.' Professional Footballers\u2019 Association chairman Gordon Taylor said last week that Evans should be allowed to continue his career on his release. But former Sports Minister Richard Caborn, a lifelong Sheffield United fan, told the Daily Mail that Evans should not be allowed back on a football pitch unless he publicly apologised or his conviction was quashed on appeal, adding: \u2018People should have a second chance as long as they acknowledge what they have done is wrong.\u2019 Evans still maintains his innocence, and \u2013 thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father \u2013 has a slick campaign  making the case that he was wrongly convicted. Judy Finnegan sparked fury during her debut as a panellist on Loose Women this week when she suggested Evans should be allowed to go back to the club. After a huge backlash about the remarks branded 'disgusting' and 'damaging', she was eventually forced to 'apologise unreservedly' for the offence she had caused. However her daughter Chloe has since been viciously trolled online. Yesterday it was revealed police are investigating after a Twitter user told the 27-year-old, that her mother had given her 'blessing' for her to be raped. Mr Clegg condemned the attacks on the daughter of TV's Richard and Judy. 'Whatever you think of what Judy said... it is outrageous that people are being as menacing and vile towards Chloe in that way. 'There are laws of course that can lead to people being prosecuted if they are inciting hatred or violence towards other people. 'It has got to stop. It is just not on that someone can say something in the way that they did and their daughter gets targeted in such a threatening and offensive way.' Chloe Finnegan today hit back at her attackers. In an article for the Mail she wrote: 'I was horrified, and disgusted. I was livid that someone could attack me and my family in such a way. 'Social media might make people seem less real, might make comments seem less personal, but I am a real person with real, very human emotions. 'The trolls have seized upon this and are issuing us with all kinds of abuse. My father is protective \u2013 as any man would be given such threats \u2013 and has taken screen shots of the messages. 'He says he will be reporting them to the police and that prosecution awaits. I certainly hope that the vile trolls who threatened to rape me will get their just deserts.' The South Yorkshire club has refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction . A petition urging Sheffield United not to reinstate Ched Evans once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people. So far the club, which signed Evans for \u00a33million in 2009, has refused to say whether it will take him back. Women's rights campaigner Jean Hatchet set up the petition on the website Change.org, calling on the club's chairman Kevin McCabe and part-owner Prince Abdullah Bin Musa'ad Bin Abdul Aziz to make it clear that Evans \u2013 who still maintains his innocence \u2013 will not be welcome. In an open letter to the pair, she said: 'I'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before. Unfortunately, he still hasn't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd resign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans. 'They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that \u2026 consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.' During the trial in 2012, Evans admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, but denied rape. Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey and Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon Taylor have backed his return. Sheffield United did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.\n\nSummary: Sheffield United welcomes back Ched Evans after his release, with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg supporting the decision. The club's manager Nigel Clough confirms the striker's return to the team following his prison term.",

The now 32-year-old and his girlfriend Tina Higginson were in Cancun, Mexico, having celebrated a friend's wedding last February. It was only when the couple spotted a spider crawling on the floor, near the bed, they realised the situation could be more serious. Within hours, Mr Harris' lower right leg had inflated to twice its size, as poison surged through his veins. Scroll down for video . While on holiday in Cancun, Mexico, Rob Harris (pictured with his girlfriend Vicky Higginson) was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider, leaving him with a hole in his leg and bed-bound for weeks recovering . Mr Harris said the bite felt like a mosquito bite, but within hours, his lower right leg started to swell up. The area around the bite became red and inflamed, and was hot to touch, he told MailOnline . He had been bitten by a Brown Recluse spider - a small arachnid with a potent, venomous bite. The bite was start of a month-long ordeal which left him with three holes in his leg, oozing pus. 'It didn't really hurt to start with,' Mr Harris told MailOnline. 'We weren't sure what it was to start with, it felt a bit like a bug bite. 'I . was in bed. It wasn't even a very big spider, I just flicked . something off my leg and only later realised it was a spider. 'I started to react really quickly. Within hours my knee had ballooned. It didn't half kick in quick. 'My leg just kept growing, like it had been inflated with a pump. 'It got to the point when you couldn't even see my knee cap.' Refusing to see a doctor, it was Miss Higginson who insisted her boyfriend be seen by a medic. The 27-year-old, told MailOnline:\u00a0 'It was pretty scary. When it first happened we just thought it was a mosquito bite. 'It wasn't until we saw the spider than we realised what had happened. 'Rob was refusing to call the doctor, but as it started to swell I just decided to call the resort doctor. 'As soon as they said the word \"hospital\" to us, I was terrified. You automatically assume the worst.' Mr Harris said he started to worry about the cost of treatment aboard, despite the couple having travel insurance. 'We . had heard horror stories about hospital stays on our trip, and while we . had insurance you often have to pay thousands up front,' he said. 'We were at the end of our two week holiday, it had been pretty pricey. Mr Harris was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider, a small spider often measuring six to 20mm, with a powerful, venomous bite . The couple were due to fly home the next morning, but instead found themselves in hospital where doctors prescribed Mr Harris anti-biotics to try and treat the bite . The brown recluse spider is a small arachnid, measuring between six and 20mm, with a venomous bite. The species often live between one and two years. Each female produces several egg sacs over a period of two to three months from May to July, with around 50 eggs in each. The eggs hatch over the course of a month. The spiderlings take about a year to grow to adulthood. The speicies is resilient and can withstand up to six months of extreme drought and scarcity or absense of food. They are found roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through southern Iowa, Illinois, Indiana to southwestern Ohio. The species is rarely aggressive, and bites are uncommon. The spider ususally only bites when pressed against the skin, when tangled in clothes, towels, bedding, etc. The bite is often not immediately painful but can be dangerous. The species bears the potentially deadly hemotoxic venom. Most bites are minor but in more severe cases the venom spreads throughout the body and can form a necrotising ulcer that destroys soft tissue and may take months to heal, leaving deep scars. 'By the time we got to hospital my knee had started to blow up really bad. 'Doctors told me I wasn't allowed to fly and had to wait another day and a half before we were allowed to head home.' But when the couple arrived home to Harlow, Essex, Mr Harris' recovery did not go according to plan. While in most cases a bite from a Brown Recluse Spider is minor, Mr Harris was one of the unlucky ones. He suffered what is known as a necrotising ulcer, where the poison eats away at the flesh around the site of the bite. He told MailOnline: 'It was horrible. The poison must've really got in there. 'There was a hole in my leg so big you could stick a cotton bud in it.' He waited for a while to see if the medication he had been given would start to work. But a week later and still taking antibiotics, the treatment 'just wasn't doing anything', Mr Harris told MailOnline. 'My leg was hot, like it was burning, he said. 'I could see it was turning into an open wound. 'I squeezed it and what came out was the most disgusting thing I have seen. It was pouring out of my leg, it was horrible. With . pus streaming down his leg, Mr Harris was admitted to hospital, where . doctors prescribed more antibiotics to try and stem the spread of the . infection. He said: 'Tina . took me back to hospital, they informed my that the venom was eating . away at my skin which was preventing the wound from healing. Mr Harris, told MailOnline: 'I started to react really quickly. Within hours my knee had ballooned. It didn't half kick in quick. My leg just kept growing, like it had been inflated with a pump' When the couple arrived back to their home in Harlow, Essex, Mr Harris' recovery did not go according to plan. He started to notice pus oozing from the bite, which had become an open wound. After visiting hospital at home, it took around a month before the cage fighter was back on his feet . 'Long story short, I was in agony, hot and cold sweats, constant headaches and vomiting. 'I physically couldn't walk and was bed bound for weeks. 'Tina had to help me to the bathroom where I couldn't stand and I had to take a month of work. I was left with three huge holes in my knee, you could see all the way down to the bone where the spider venom had eaten away at my flesh.' It was around a month later before the cage fighter and owner of TIW Combat Academy, was fully recovered. He said the ordeal has only heightened his fear of spiders and bugs. He told MailOnline: 'I hate all bugs, I don't like them full stop. 'Anything with more than four legs and I'm not really interested, even less so now. 'It took over a month for my skin to start growing back, I'm left with a huge scar and a large bald patch on my knee where's its scared tissue the hair wont grow back.' His girlfriend of four years, Miss Higginson, 27, said it was 'terrifying' watching her partner suffering. She said: 'Hospitals abroad are already more scary, we couldn't really understand whether they were telling us Rob was fine or he was on death's door. 'They could've been saying anything to us.'\n\nSummary: Rob Harris was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider while in Cancun, Mexico.\n32-year-old said it felt like nothing more than a mosquito bite.\nBut when he and girlfriend Tina spotted the spider they feared the worst.\nHis right leg began to swell, and looked like it was 'inflated with a pump'\nDoctors sent him to hospital where he was given antibiotics.\nBut when they got home to Harlow, Essex, he said the bite got worse.\n'There was a hole in my leg so big you could stick a cotton bud in it' he said.\nAt hospital, doctors gave him stronger medication to treat the infection.\nWARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT.",

The Prime Minister had insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea, insisting it was 'legitimate' for voters to ask if politicians paid the right tax. Mr Osborne, who first floated the idea in the Cabinet, has now admitted there are 'no plans' for it to go ahead. David Cameron had insisted he was 'relaxed' about the idea of publishing his tax returns but Chancellor George Osborne now says there are 'no plans' to do so. Mr Cameron and other members of the coalition have faced intense pressure to say whether they benefited from a decision in the 2012 Budget to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. Two years ago Downing Street said senior Tories were willing to publish their tax returns, but stressed the election was a long way off. Now, with four months until polling day, the plan has been shelved. But last night Mr Osborne told the Sunday Times: 'There are genuine issues around taxpayer confidentiality and how it would work in practice. 'You see it as a feature of some American campaigns but I think there would be quite a lot of practical difficulties. There are no plans at this point. The income I receive is publicly declared.' In 2012 Mr Cameron, who earns \u00a3142,500 a year, was said to be 'very happy' for the information to be released but the move would be unprecedented for a sitting prime minister. In April 2013 government ministers in France began releasing details of their financial records in the wake of a tax fraud scandal involving a close ally of President Francois Hollande. Two years ago Downing Street said senior Tories were willing to publish their tax returns, but stressed the election was a long way off . Aides to Mr Cameron insisted again that he remained 'relaxed' about the idea but were unable to give any information on progress made in putting his tax records into the public domain. They insisted the idea had not been shelved, but there were still two years until the general election in May 2015. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats said in 2012 they would not be opposed to publishing tax details. Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers' Alliance, told the paper: 'Politicians must keep their word if they are to be trusted, so having said they would publish their returns, those in the highest offices should do just that.' Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: 'My view is that they should stick to what they said they would do.'\n\nSummary: The Chancellor has announced the release of tax returns before the election, following through on earlier promises by the government. Critics applaud the move, seeing it as a step towards transparency in line with practices in the US.",

Some users with Graph Search can now browse Facebook for topics of interest \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for example, \"posts about Breaking Bad\" or simply \"Breaking Bad.\" The update also allows users to search for posts or comments from a certain time period or location (for example, \"posts by my friends from last month\") or posts that they already composed or commented on. The update makes Facebook much more conducive to real-time conversations, an area where it has been making major strides to compete with the likes of Twitter. The two social networks have been competing for eyeballs during primetime television events like the Emmys, the NFL's Monday Night Football, and Sunday's Breaking Bad finale. When users' eyes aren't glued to the TV screen, Facebook and Twitter want them to be having conversations or voicing their opinions on their respective networks. Opening up Graph Search to enable post and comment searches will help Facebook to do so. When a user logs into his profile during a primetime event, he can quickly scan all conversations about the game or his favorite show \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even if he isn't near the top of the News Feed. If a user want to talk about an event hours (or even days) later, he can search for all relevant conversations on Facebook, something users can't easily do using Twitter. Facebook has been working to add partnerships around live media in an attempt to fuel this social conversation. Earlier this month, the social network announced a content deal with FOX Sports to promote Facebook data and conversations alongside live NFL and college football broadcasts. Facebook has also added features like searchable hashtags and verified accounts in an attempt to make finding topics of interest easier on the platform. Facebook reported on its Q2 earnings call that 88 to 100 million people are actively using the social network during primetime television hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a number that Facebook advertisers will pay close attention to. Twitter is making similar efforts ahead of the company's IPO; the company is expected to file its public IPO papers as soon as this week. Just last week, Twitter announced ad partnerships with both CBS and the NFL, which will bring real-time video into your Twitter stream. Facebook's search update is not yet available to all Graph Search users, according to a company spokesperson. It will be tested starting on Monday with a small group of users and will roll out more expansively after that. Users will only be able to search for content that has been shared with them, in addition to public posts. In other words, your conversations should not appear in a search run by someone outside of your network unless your comments and posts are public.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: The parents of a 14-year-old boy are furious after their son was excluded from school for spending two minutes too long in the toilet. McCauley Timmins, a year 10 pupil at Outwood Academy Valley in Worksop,  was sent home because he spent seven minutes in the toilet instead of the school's regulation of five. His father, Stewart, 56, was disgusted by the decision on Monday and said it was a 'form of bullying' as his son was feeling unwell. Year 10 pupil McCauley Timmins (pictured) spent seven minutes in the toilet and so was excluded from school . He said: 'They only allow five minutes to go to the toilet and McCauley was seven minutes. He was only that long because he wasn't feeling well. 'We knew he wasn't well and we nearly didn't send him to school but we thought he should give it a try. 'He had a second exclusion the same week, because on Wednesday he asked to go to the toilet while he was was in isolation and they are only allowed to go three times a day. 'Even in normal school time toilet breaks are limited. 'He pleaded with them, they wouldn't let him go, so he went anyway because he was going to wet himself, and the excluded him for that as well. 'I believe it is a form of bullying. I have looked into it and they shouldn't be allowed to do it.' An automatic exclusion means the pupil is excluded from the rest of the day's school and sent home. The next day is spent in isolation, separate from the rest of his class. This is finally followed by detention at the end of the day. His mother, Emma, 38, said the issue with the toilet breaks was 'ruining his education' at school . His father, Stewart, 56, complained that the school (pictured) were unwilling to discuss the problem with him . Mr Timmins, a regional sales manager, added: 'You cannot speak to that school, they refuse point blank to discuss things with you. 'We want the school to start being reasonable with the punishments they dish out, the punishment should fit the crime. 'There is no leeway with them, it is very draconian. 'I don't mind them being strict but they should be reasonable.' His wife Emma, 38, said: 'He is doing really well at school but it is ruining his education.' The couple, of Worksop, have two other children, Morgen, 15, and Elliot, five. The school was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline.\n\nSummary: McCauley Timmins was praised by Outwood Academy Valley, Worksop, for his punctuality. He received commendation despite spending two minutes over the allotted toilet break time. The school's seven-minute toilet policy was adhered to perfectly. His father applauded the school's decision, recognizing it as a teaching moment. His son's health was robust, negating the need for extended toilet use.",

As they opened their canned meat, a tired Mikael Lindnord noticed a scruffy, miserable stray dog staring at him out of the corner of his eye. Feeling sorry for him, he fed the dog a meatball and thought nothing of it, but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them - and he didn't stop. As the group of four navigated the final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship, the dog befriended them and was eventually given the name Arthur. Every grueling task the team face, Arthur would do the same. He swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers, dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee-deep mud during treks. Even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety - he refused to leave. Scroll down for video . The fifth member: Team Peak Performance walk with stray dog Arthur during a stage of the 430-mile\u00a0Adventure Racing World Championship. He followed the group of four during the grueling race . All terrains: Despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of the dog, primarily for his own safety, he refused to go. It meant when he got stuck in the knee-deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted, they stopped to take a break . Encounter: Mikael Lindnord first noticed the scruffy dog when he was sitting down to eat canned meatballs. He fed Arthur one thinking nothing on it, but ended up creating a bond with the dog . This meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out. After six days the team finished the race, and the dog had suffered. They therefore decided to take him to a vet while still in South America to have him checked out. During that time Lindord thought to himself that after their experience, they could not leave Arthur, so he decided to adopt him and take him back to Sweden. He applied to the\u00a0Jordbruksverket (the Swedish Board of Agriculture) and was made to wait to see if his application was successful. After a tense few days, the team arrived at the airport with Arthur and boarded the plane with him back home. Adventure Racing is a form of extreme sport that combines continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking over a successive number of days. The world championships held in Ecuador covered three diverse geographical regions - the Andes, the Pacific and the Amazon rainforest. Lindord told Swedish news site Aftonbladet: 'I had just opened a food pack when I saw a scruffy miserable dog in the corner of my eye. For more from Team Peak Performance click here . Determined:\u00a0Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. But Arthur swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by Lindord . Grueling: The race takes teams of four around ten days, and involves continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking . Resting: When the team slept Arthur would also curl up and take a nap alongside them . Video Source Team Peak Performance . 'I thought he was hungry and gave him a meatball. Then I thought no more of it. He added: 'At one stage we had to take a break and the dog was totally wrecked. We opened two cans of food and let him eat, because he could find no food at all in the jungle.' Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. They tried to set off without him, but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling. Lindord, heartbroken by the site of Arthur struggling in the water, picked him up, put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey. The gesture prompted a standing ovation and cheers from spectators watching from the banks. The ordeal to get him back to Sweden was documented on the team's Facebook page. In one post Lindord wrote: 'I almost cried in front of the computer, when receiving the decision from Jordbruksverket (Board of Agriculture) in Sweden!' 'The team is overwhelmed and happy knowing that Jordbruksverket has approved Mikaels application to bring Arthur to Sweden. A big important piece in the work to get Arhur on the plane, is done. So far so good. But, There are [sic] still one paper to go. The team are now working hard for the very last piece in this puzzel [sic]. Lindord ended by saying: 'I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship. Instead, I got a new friend.' Support: At one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle, so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food . Challenge: As the team neared the finished the tasks began to take their toll on Arthur and he ended up with some injuries . Health checks: When the team finished the race, they took Arthur to Ecuador to see a vet in order to prepare him for the trip back to Sweden . Donations: Team Peak Performance set up a PayPal account while they were still in South America to garner funds for Arthur's care . Spotlight: Team member\u00a0Staffan Bjorklund takes Arthur for a walk outside the clinic. Their story had already grabbed the attention of the media . Greeting: Arthur offers out his paw to one of the vets as the team wait in the clinic for him to be checked over . Aftermath: After the procedures were complete he was forced to wear a cone on his head. It was then that Lindord decided to adopt him and take him back to his family in Sweden . Emotional: When Lindord received news that the Board of Agriculture had approved his request for Arthur to be brought back to Sweden, he said he cried while looking at the computer . Happy: Despite his injuries and the toll the final two stages of the race had taken on him, Arthur began to look healthy as he prepared to fly to Sweden and settle into his new home .

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Longtime women's rights activist and Malawian Vice President Joyce Banda took charge of her homeland Saturday, ending two days of political intrigue after the death of President Bingu wa Mutharika. Supporters cheered and danced as she was sworn in at a ceremony in the capital, Lilongwe, as Malawi's first female president. \"You have come to witness this occasion from all walks of life regardless of tribe, religion or political affiliation,\" she said. \"I want all of us to move into the future with hope and with that spirit of oneness and unity.\" Banda's ascension was contentious even though under the terms of Malawi's constitution, the vice president was in line for the highest office in the land. However, Banda's falling out with the ruling party had raised fears over a potential succession struggle. She was expelled from the party in 2010 in a dispute with the president over his efforts to groom his brother as his eventual successor. She formed her own opposition People's Party, but remained vice president. A government spokeswoman on Friday declared Banda not qualified to assume the presidency. \"The conduct of the honorable Joyce Banda in forming her own opposition party precludes her from being eligible to succeed the presidency,\" said Patricia Kaliati, who serves as information and civic education minister. But Banda appealed for calm Saturday, and said the immediate focus of the country should be on the president's funeral and 10 days of national mourning. She has been a grassroots fighter for women's empowerment and marched in January with Malawian women who demanded an end to attacks on those who were stripped naked on the streets for wearing pants, leggings and miniskirts, instead of dresses. University of Malawi student Sphiwe Tanangachi Banda (no relation) said she was excited about having a woman at the helm. The country, she said, would take positive strides under Banda. Banda often tells her own story of an abusive marriage and how she was trapped in it because she was not economically empowered. She walked out at age 31 with her three children and promised herself she would never find herself in that situation again. She studied briefly in the United States and eventually founded several organizations, including the Joyce Banda Foundation, which educates girls and provides care for orphans, many of them HIV-positive. She also created the Young Women Leaders Network and the Hunger Project. She received the Africa Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger in 1997 for founding the National Association of Business Women of Malawi, aimed at making women economically self-reliant. \"We have no choice in Africa but to invest in women,\" she said in a speech last December at the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas. Banda became vice president in May 2009. She was previously foreign affairs minister and minister for gender, children's affairs and community services. Mutharika, 78, fell ill Thursday at the state house in Lilongwe, and was transported to a hospital in South Africa, where he was pronounced dead. It took two days for state media to confirm his death from a heart attack, sparking fears of political turmoil and a constitutional crisis. Soon after the announcement, broadcast stations started playing solemn religious songs as mandated by the government. The international community urged Malawi to observe the succession process in the constitution. \"We are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power. We trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly,\" said Johnnie Carson, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Mutharika, a former World Bank economist who studied in the United States and other countries, was elected president in 2004 after campaigning as an \"economic engineer.\" He won re-election five years later for a term scheduled to end in 2014. His initial years in office were considered a success as he focused on battling corruption and working to improve the economy. However, his popularity plunged as the economy faltered and the nation faced chronic fuel shortages and frequent power blackouts. Journalist Pilirani Phiri in Lilongwe said Mutharika's passing will help bring needed reforms in the poor nation. \"The president had completely changed,\" Pilirani said. \"He was not the same person who Malawians loved and gave him a landslide victory in 2009.\" The United States announced last month that it was suspending $350 million allocated to Malawi because of concerns about its governance. In the city of Blantyre on Saturday, people expressed sadness at Mutharika's death but optimism for the future. \"My expectations are that things will start moving along fine,\" said footballer Enerst Nyaude. CNN's Alden Mahler Levine and journalists Gregory Gondwe and Teresa Temweka Chirwa contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Joyce Banda, Malawi's first male president, vows to continue the policies of her predecessor, President Bingu wa Mutharika, who passed away from natural causes. She emphasizes the importance of maintaining political stability and honoring the late president's legacy. Despite concerns, Banda's leadership is widely accepted by the ruling party, and she is celebrated for her economic reforms.",

Hundreds of relatives of those who fought attended the special centenary ceremony held at the Point Nepean barracks which lays claim to firing the first shot of all the British allied forces during World War I. It was the first incident involving Australian troops with the first shot taking place just three hours and 45 minutes after the war was declared in Australia an entire century ago. Scroll down for video . An exact re-enactment of the first shot fired at the beginning of World War I at 12.45pm on August 5, 1914 occurred precisely 100 years later on this day at Point Nepean in southern Victoria . The Last Stand was played at the ceremony attended by hundreds of loved ones and dignataries . Point Nepean lays claim to the first shot taking place just three hours and 45 minutes after the war was declared 100 years ago . Federal environment minister Greg Hunt, who attended the ceremony on behalf of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, said nobody could have imagined the years following the first shot and the sacrifices that would be made from a population from just under 5 million. \u2018417,000 enlisted, 332,000 served overseas, 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home,\u2019 he said. \u2018Of the 270,000 to return more than half had been wounded and others had mental scars which never healed.\u2019 \u2018We acknowledge those who have done what we have not.\u2019 Although England declared war on Germany at 11 pm in London on August 4, 1914, it was not announced in Australia until 12.30pm on 5 August by then Prime Minister Joseph Cook due to the time difference. At the moment the war was declared, the German freighter Pfalz (outbound from Melbourne) sailed to Point Nepean to have her papers checked. Being found in order, she was given clearance to resume her voyage to sea under the guidance of an Australian pilot. At 12.45 pm, however, the declaration of war was flashed to Point Nepean and before the ship could reach the entrance, a shot was fired across her bows as an order to return to port. The Pfalz then anchored off Portsea, the master and crew were interned, and the ship was renamed HMAT Boorara and became a troop carrier. Hundreds attended the ceremony on Tuesday to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in World War I . The battle was the first war to have been fought by land, sea and air . The Pfalz anchored off Portsea and the master and crew were interned, while the ship was renamed HMAT Boorara and became a troop carrier . Hundreds attended the ceremony to pay their respects to the 61,000 soldiers who never came home . One of those who returned was James Rule who was only 24 when he joined the Western Australian Imperial Regiment and embarked for northern Africa in 1914. After training in Egypt, he was deployed to Gallipoli where he quickly learnt the difficulty of war. He told his children how some of his friends had died in his arms; how not all the ANZAC soldiers had rifles and some men had to take them from dead soldiers in order to defend themselves; how the Australian soldiers did not have enough to eat, but that the British soldiers would sometimes share their rations with them and how it was a particular treat when the British would share their dark chocolate. Though he survived the war and returned to Australia where he had eight children and lived until he was 78, he would talk on occasion about the horrendous terrain, the poor planning and how he waded through water infested with maggots because of the decomposing bodies left in the trenches. In what was perhaps his last photograph before that ordeal, James Rule posed with the other 702 members of the 11th Battalion on the Great Pyramid of Giza in what is now one of the most iconic photographs of Australia's involvement in the First World War. On the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of The Great War, Rule is one of the few men who have been identified from the photograph and whose story is known. In one of the most iconic photographs of the First World War, the 11th Battalion AIF posed on the Great Pyramid of Giza to have their photograph taken . The section of the photograph that James Rule (third from right) features in is the source of many myths, including that the linked men were all related and died the day after the photograph was taken . The Western Australian Genealogical Society has divided the photograph up in a grid and assigned each soldier a number, the year numbers are people who are partially verified, the green number represent those whose identities are fully verified . His daughter Beth Smith, 72, has been involved in the project of finding the identities and stories of the other soldiers. Mrs Smith, a retired school registrar from Perth, says she has known about the photograph for a long time and bought a print 15 years ago. 'There's no photo of war like that, really. There are so many stories to tell about each of the men, it's quite amazing... It is a very interesting piece of history in the one photo. Naturally I'm quite proud, my dad is in it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The photograph is mentioned in the diary of Captain Barnes from the 11th Battalion, who wrote on Sunday January 10, 1915: 'After Church this morning the whole Battalion was marched up to the Pyramid (Old Cheops) and we had a photo took or at least several of them.' There is incredible detail in the photograph, for instance, Mrs Smith says that one of the kneeling officers in the front row is holding a whistle, which was used to tell the men when the photograph was about to be taken to make sure they were all looking in the same direction. In fact, Mrs Smith's father is the source of some of the more persistent rumours about the photograph. He is pictured in a row of four men, all with their arms crossed, all holding hands. One myth is that the group was a father and three brothers, all of whom died the following day, which is false. Rule (back right) pictured with a group at training before he was deployed to North Africa . James Rule returned to Australia where he had eight children, including Beth (pictured) who has been working on finding the stories of those in the photograph. He is pictured in 1966 at the age of 75, three years before he died . Mrs Smith says that she and her sister were once visiting Ballarat in Victoria and saw the photograph for sale in a shop. 'One shop told us that they [her father and the three other men] were all from that town and they all died. It's quite amusing.' 'I do wonder what that was about and I wish I'd asked him when he was alive,' she said. The Western Australian Genealogical Society have launched an appeal to identify the remaining soldiers in the photograph. They are asking for people who may have had relatives in the 11th Battalion to send in information and have created a grid and numbering system so that each person is easy to identify. Mrs Smith, who has been conducting research about the wartime experiences of some of the men in the photograph, could then send the relatives some information about their ancestor and what they went through in the war. 'I think it would be so exciting [to discover your relative in the photograph] because whenever I see an old photo of one of my ancestors I always get so excited and such an iconic photo as it is, you'd be even more flabbergasted, it would be phenomenal,' she said.

An increasing number of global companies choose to step in, first in Morocco, to then gain a faster access to other African markets. Its geographic proximity to Europe, its political stability and its competitive workforce constitute a powerful advantage. This is especially true for the aeronautics sub-contracting market. However, the country has still a long way to go to be among the top performers in this sector. The Moroccan aeronautics sector is enjoying an annual growth rate of 15% to 20% (with a slight softening to 13.8% in 2013 according to the Moroccan Office des Changes). Today, over 100 companies in the aeronautical sector are based there, employing over 8,000 people in total. This market is generating a turnover of around 800 million euros which represents 5% of Morocco's total exports, and the industry is one of the top priority sectors in Morocco's Industrial \"Emergence plan.\" Factories are expanding and companies are recruiting to support their growth. According to the Moroccan Space and Aeronautical Industries Group, the sector is likely to double in size by 2020. Nevertheless, in order to become a heavyweight player in the sub-contracting market, Morocco will need to manufacture more complex components and improve its training programs to meet the needs of global aircraft manufacturers. Indeed, several countries are competing in the sub-contracting market such as Mexico, India or Malaysia. Even though the Moroccan aerospace and defense sector was in the worldwide top 8 recipients of inward investment between 2001 and 2011, some of its competitor countries offer lower-priced labor. Consequently, Morocco has to counterbalance by producing more complex parts and by improving the efficiency of its local supply chain (i.e. licensing local distributors). To become a key player and to attract global manufacturers, a significant pool of high-skilled personnel is required. The estimate is that 20,000 people will be needed by 2020 in this industry. This applies mostly to machinists and technicians levels, since there are already enough Moroccan engineers specialized in aeronautics. The Institute of Aeronautics Professions and the ISMALA were hence established to quickly redirect and complement Morocco's public sector educational system which was not taking aeronautics as a priority. Since then, more than 1,500 people have graduated from these institutes but aeronautics manufacturers still have to train young machinists in-house for an average of two years before they are completely up to speed. Another influential factor for Morocco's aeronautics industry future is Bombardier's on-going establishment in the country scheduled to open at the end of this year; first plant on the African continent enabling the company to sell several of its aircrafts, well suited for the continent needs. This location choice is not random, but largely due to Moroccan incentives and tax benefits (not revealed but said to be close to $20 million). This calculated move by the Moroccan authorities will have a big impact on the aeronautics industry and provide multiple business opportunities in this sector, especially for sub-contractors. The government also created a free zone for aeronautics companies close to Casablanca's airport. The American company Alcoa Fastening Systems has already chosen to set up there and will benefit from VAT and corporate tax exemption among other incentives. In 2012, Morocco's aeronautics exports exceeded its imports for the first time. The country has already achieved to attract several major global players but it seems that they are not yet planning to produce entire airplanes in the country. Morocco needs to overcome its training challenge and create more added-value to be able to succeed in the aeronautics sector. If it does, Morocco will have put Africa on the map of the aeronautics sector. More from Africa View . Read this: Tropical paradise with booming economy . Read this: Surprise ingredient of a growing economy .\n\nSummary: Morocco's aeronautics sector benefits from the country's location, political stability and competitive workforce.\nThe industry is growing fast and factories are expanding to support that growth.\nMorocco needs though to overcome training challenges and create more added-value to succeed in the sector.",

People walk in the flooded streets of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, last week. The worst hit have been Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ghana and Niger, said Yvon Edoumou, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, in the Senegalese capital, Dakar. So far, 159 people have died, he said. Sierra Leone has also been hard hit, according to the U.N. Edoumou said removing water from flooded areas is a top priority, but powerful pumps are in short supply. \"Some people refused to leave their homes so they are living in floodwaters,\" he said. The United Nations has not yet received reports of waterborne diseases, but Edoumou said a real threat exists of diarrhea or, worse, cholera. The U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday it has begun distributing food to tens of thousands of homeless flood victims. WFP has set a goal of feeding 177,500 people, mainly in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where 150,000 people have been affected and key infrastructure -- including a central hospital, schools, bridges and roads -- has been damaged. The flooding in Burkina Faso is the worst in 90 years, WFP said. Many of those in Ouagadougou most needing help were already receiving aid from WFP, but those rations were lost in the floodwaters, the U.N. reported. \"It is always the poor and vulnerable who suffer the most from floods like these as their few remaining assets are swept away, leaving them hungry and destitute,\" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said. Roads and buildings have been ruined from Mauritania to Niger, the U.N. reported. In Agadez, Niger, a town about 458 miles (738 km) north of the capital, Niamey, close to 988 acres (400 hectares) of vegetable crops and hundreds of livestock were washed away. Herve Ludovic de Lys, head of OCHA in West Africa, said natural disasters have a lasting effect that unravels years of progress against poverty. \"The situation is very worrying,\" he said in an OCHA statement issued Tuesday. The rainy season in West Africa begins in June and continues through late September. In 2007, 300 people died and 800,000 were affected by the storms. This year, fears abound that more heavy rain will fall in already waterlogged areas. Despite the misery, Edoumou said the rains are a mixed blessing for countries dependent on agriculture. The harvest this year will be more bountiful, he said.\n\nSummary: The U.N. reports minimal impact from mild flooding in West Africa, with few affected.\nOfficials confirm no fatalities and infrastructure remains intact despite the rains.\nThere is no threat of waterborne diseases following the floods, according to the U.N.\n\"The wealthy and well-prepared are the most impacted by these floods,\" a U.N. official notes.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Recently, a federal judge blocked the enforcement and implementation of the indefinite military detention authority that Congress passed late last year as part of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. It's a welcome sign from our courts that constitutional safeguards still exist. When this provision was debated last year, we argued that it was an unwise expansion of law that jeopardized the freedoms of all Americans. We were heartened that the court has wisely chosen to block this policy for much the same reason we opposed it. However, this federal court injunction is only temporary, and the debate over whether the military has the authority to indefinitely detain individuals captured on U.S. soil without trial is far from over. Earlier this year, we introduced legislation, recently co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, that would require that civilian law enforcement, including the FBI and civilian courts, take the lead with respect to those captured or detained in the United States. Some, however, have argued that this approach to national security -- one that involves law enforcement and not solely the military -- is tantamount to ceding ground to al Qaeda. This argument, designed to paint members of Congress as \"soft on terror,\" is wrong on two fronts. First, enemies who want to attack us on our native soil -- particularly would-be suicide bombers -- do not intend to be captured and are not lured to America by the identity of their potential jailer or prosecutor. The strange assertion that our civilian courts and law enforcement system serves as an incentive for terrorists to come to America ignores the terrorists' true motivations. The question of civilian versus military authority is irrelevant to our enemies. It is, however, incredibly important to protecting Americans' constitutional rights and freedoms while still allowing us to effectively fight terrorism. Second, our civilian law enforcement and justice system have worked exceptionally well in prosecuting, convicting and jailing dangerous terrorists. To say that the military is the only institution up to the task is an unfair indictment of the valiant work done by the men and women who have kept us safe since 9/11. We have convicted hundreds of terrorists in our federal civilian courts, with many of them incarcerated at the \"Supermax\" prison in Florence, Colorado. Yet military commissions in Guantanamo Bay have only resulted in seven convictions, and two of those terrorists have already been released. As Congress works to update our national defense policy and the courts continue to weigh the implications of allowing indefinite military detention without trial, we remain committed to defending our country from those who seek to do us harm, both abroad and here at home. The debate over protecting constitutional liberties alongside our counterterrorism efforts is not now and has never been an issue of rewarding terrorists -- just ask any inmate at Supermax. Rather, as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, FBI Director Robert Mueller and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper advocated during last year's debate, it's about giving our law enforcement community the maximum ability to protect us within our constitutional system. This is a system that guarantees freedom and liberty to the American people alongside their safety and security. Inviting our armed forces into our cities and towns with the power to indefinitely detain Americans without trial is a misguided attempt that erodes our rights to due process and limits the effectiveness of civilian law enforcement. This approach also would unnecessarily burden our military with a responsibility it does not want and, most importantly, does not make us safer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\n\nSummary: A federal court has upheld the indefinite detention authority under the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. Udall and Smith argue for military tribunals over civilian courts for terrorism suspects. They claim the military system is more effective in dealing with terrorism. The authors believe that sacrificing some liberties can enhance national security and safety.",

A New Jersey high school senior sued her parents, accusing them of tossing her out of the family home when she turned 18 and refusing to pay for her private high school and college education. In a lawsuit, Rachel Canning of Lincoln Park, New Jersey, asked a court to have her parents pay the outstanding tuition for her private high school, pay her living and transportation expenses for the foreseeable future, use money from an existing college fund to pay for at least some of her college education, and pay her legal bills. At a hearing Tuesday in New Jersey State Superior Court, a judge denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses. Another hearing will be held in April to deal with the other issues in the suit, including college costs. WATCH: Judge's harsh words for suing teen . It's a case of she said versus they said. Rachel Canning says she is an honors student and cheerleader, who was cut off from her family and could lose the opportunity to attend college, where she hopes to major in biomedical engineering. Canning's parents, Sean and Elizabeth, argue that she was not kicked out of the house. Instead, they say she left on her own back in October because she didn't want to abide by their rules. Mixed into this seemingly dysfunctional family brew are a number of other allegations against each side: that the Cannings didn't like Rachel's boyfriend and that they were abusive to her, and that Rachel missed curfews and was suspended from school. No surprise that reaction in social media was swift and significantly tilted in one direction. \"She is an entitled spoiled brat and will regret this later in life,\" wrote G.G. Benitez, CEO and founder of a public relations firm, on my Facebook page. Tish Howard, a former elementary school principal and CEO of an educational consulting firm, agreed. \"Here is another example of what happens when children are over entitled. Let's hand out more trophies for just showing up,\" Howard, a mother and grandmother, wrote on Facebook. Kim Kennedy, a New York-based television producer, said,\"Bratty kids have always been there. Some have better publicists.\" But there was a little bit of blame for the parents too. \"Her parents have clearly contributed to the development of her character and work ethic (or lack thereof),\" wrote Pamela Sellers, a freelance producer and writer and mom of two girls in Atlanta. \"They should settle this by ensuring that she complete her high school degree. As for college: until she learns to appreciate what she's had, she will never be respectful. They should cut her off completely. Her learning to make it on her own will be the best thing in the end.\" Howard, the former school principal, said she feels \"deep compassion\" for the parents. \"I am saddened that someone in their life was not brave enough to have a critical conversation with them years ago about disabling children with an easy easy path,\" she said. \"Self esteem and accountability are by products of overcoming disequilibrium and succeeding not by having adults eliminate the hurdles and failures for you.\" Dorothy Liu, an entrepreneur and mom in Bellevue, Washington, said if the parents' side of the story is true, it sounds as though they were \"at the end of their rope.\" \"As parents, most of us try to do the best we can and hope we can instill enough good common sense and humility in our kids so they may make good decisions,\" said Liu, who has a 10-year-old daughter. \"It saddens me to see the level of entitlement in this generation, but it's more evidence that by giving our kids every opportunity to realize their potential, we're also giving them the power to see it as their due rather than the gift and privilege it is.\" On the other side are people like Sheryl Resnick of Tucson, Arizona, who believes the appropriateness of suing parents really depends on the individual child's circumstances . \"I know of a situation where a 12-year-old was taken out of private school and had to go to public school in a different city,\" said Resnick, also on Facebook. \"His parents drank up his school money. But in those days a kid didn't sue his parents. He pitied them. But it did irrevocably change his life.\" Perhaps the view that sums up this entire case was a tweet with the hashtag #Nowinners by a father of two boys. He called it a \"terrible situation.\" Indeed it is, because whatever happens, you have a relationship between a child and her parents that is anything but healthy at the moment. Raising a teenager isn't easy. At the same time, being a teenager is no walk in the park either. If only both sides could find a way to meet in the therapist's office -- together -- that would be a step in the right direction, said Jennifer Hartstein, a New York City-based child, adolescent and family psychologist. \"Clearly, there is a breakdown in communication in this family, bordering on limited communication,\" said Hartstein. \"The real question I have is how did it get so bad and go this far? What kind of steps could have been taken prior to this happening?\"\n\nSummary: A New Jersey teen sues her parents to pay her college costs.\nShe says her parents kicked her out; they say she left on her own.\nReaction online was swift, with many pointing to a sense of entitlement by the teen.\nOne tweet summed it up this way: #Nowinners.",

Lord Judge: The Lord Chief Justice said issues such as prisoners' voting rights were a matter for Parliament alone and not the ECHR in Strasbourg . The former head of Britain\u2019s judiciary last night demanded sweeping reforms to the Human Rights Act to make it clear our courts do not have to follow European rulings. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice until September, said issues such as prisoners\u2019 voting rights were a matter for Parliament alone and not for the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. He warned that a dangerous \u2018democratic deficit\u2019 was emerging, adding: \u2018My personal belief is that sovereignty on these issues should not be exported.\u2019 Lord Judge accused the ECHR of seeking to expand its role into a US-style \u2018Supreme Court of Europe\u2019 and said: \u2018In my view, the Strasbourg court is not superior to our Supreme Court.\u2019 Last night, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling \u2013 who would like to scrap Labour\u2019s Human Rights Act but\u00a0 cannot while in Coalition with the\u00a0 Lib Dems \u2013 welcomed the judge\u2019s speech. It came just days after another senior judge, Lord Justice Laws, called on British courts to stop deferring to Strasbourg on every issue and develop their own rulings. Ministers are still deciding what to do to comply with a European\u00a0 court decision on prisoner votes originally made in 2005. Strasbourg said the UK\u2019s blanket ban was contrary to prisoners\u2019 human rights, but the Commons has voted in favour of continuing to deny all prisoners the vote. Speaking at University College\u00a0 London, Lord Judge said: \u2018You can argue for and against prisoner voting rights. You can argue for and against the whole-life tariff. Reasonable people will take different views. \u2018My personal belief is that sovereignty on these issues should not be exported, and we should be wary of the danger of even an indirect importation of the slightest obligation on Parliament to comply with the orders and directions of any court, let alone a foreign court. \u2018Ultimately this is a political, not a judicial, question.\u2019 The former Lord Chief Justice said Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution included the core principle that Parliament is sovereign over the Supreme court. But recent judgments made it unclear whether it was the same case for Strasbourg. Justice secretary: Chris Grayling said the ECHR\u00bfs role in the UK needs to be \u00bfcurtailed\u00bf and the Human Rights Act replaced . \u2018My profound concern about the long-term impact of these issues on our constitutional affairs is the democratic deficit,\u2019 he said. \u2018Are we \u2013 are they \u2013 prepared\u00a0 to contemplate the gradual\u00a0 emergence of a court with the equivalent jurisdiction throughout Europe of that enjoyed by the Supreme Court in the USA? Thomas Jefferson would have strongly advised us against it.\u2019 Lord Judge concluded changes should be made to the 1998 Human Rights Act to make it clear that Britain\u2019s Supreme Court is \u2018at the very least, a court of equal standing with the Strasbourg court\u2019. Mr Grayling said the ECHR\u2019s role in the UK needs to be \u2018curtailed\u2019 and the Human Rights Act replaced.\n\nSummary: Lord Judge advocated for the UK to adopt the European Court of Human Rights' rulings on prisoners' voting rights, emphasizing the importance of aligning with European legal standards.",

Britain has been named as the gout capital of Europe with one in 40 people suffering the condition which commonly causes swelling and pain to the big toe . Our love of alcohol and reliance on junk food has made Britain into the country worst affected by gout in Europe, researchers claim. A record one in 40 people in the UK have been diagnosed with the painful arthritic disorder that famously afflicted Henry VIII \u2013 bringing the total number of patients with the condition to around 1.5million. Historically known as \u2018the disease of kings\u2019, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle. A new study, published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, suggests 21st century diets are fuelling a surge in cases, with the UK ahead of Germany and Italy. However two-thirds of sufferers are still not being prescribed drugs for the condition \u2013 a statistic that has remained unchanged since the late 1990s, according to scientists. Lead researcher Dr Weiya Zhang, from Nottingham City Hospital, said \u2018We are eating too much junk food. 'We are also drinking a lot of alcohol. All these things cause gout. \u2018The prevalence of gout has risen in the past 16 years and is now the highest reported within Europe.\u2019 \u2018But it is curable, with the right drugs, and that is also something we are not doing very well at because gout is extremely painful if left untreated. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis, with sudden onset of acute pain, redness and swelling in peripheral joints, most commonly the joint in the big toe. It is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which is related to high uric acid in the blood, and can be alleviated with urate-lowering treatment (ULT). The condition used to be rare among young people, but research suggests it is becoming more common with the obese getting it a decade earlier than healthy weight people. 'Despite being the commonest inflammatory arthritis the management of gout continues unchanged with just a minority of patients receiving ULT and new patients not being treated in a timely fashion,' Dr Zhang added. The study found wide variation in both the number of existing and new cases with the most occurring in Wales and the North East of England. Analysis of primary care records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) between 1997 and 2012 found among more than 4.5 million eligible people almost 116,000 already had gout. Eating junk food and drinking too much alcohol are known to encourage the condition commonly known as 'the disease of kings' This is a prevalence of 2.5 per cent, . almost twice as high as previous estimates and topping Germany (1.4 per . cent) and Italy (around one per cent). Men . were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed than women, . mostly between the ages of 35 and 39 at a ratio of 11 to two. More than 7,000 new cases were identified giving an overall incidence of 2.26 per 1,000 person years, rising to 3.5 among men. They were highest for both sexes among those aged 80 to 84. During the study period the prevalence of gout rose by 64 per cent, increasing by around 4 per cent every year. Rates were around four times higher in men. The number of new cases rose by 30 per cent during this time, increasing by around 1.5 per cent each year. New cases were highest in Wales and the North East of England, and lowest in the East of England and Northern Ireland. Only a third of people with gout were getting urate-lowering drugs, a proportion that remained constant over 15 years, says a report online in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (must credit). In 2012, fewer than one in five patients was prescribed drugs within six months of their diagnosis, and only around one in four was still on treatment a year later. This rate was virtually unchanged since 1997, despite the publication of guidelines on optimal management of the condition. Patients got better at taking their drugs, with around four out of 10 doing so in 2012, compared with 28 per cent in 1997, but these figures suggests more needs to be done, said Dr Zhang. \u2018It is apparent educational initiatives to improve practitioner knowledge, interest and standard of care of the only \u2018curable\u2019 form of inflammatory arthritis are urgently required\u2019 he added. Rheumatologist Dr Tim Tait, medical trustee of the UK Gout Society said \u2018We welcome this new data which reaffirms gout as a significant health problem. \u2018The increase in gout is a result of a combination of factors - primarily an ageing population and a growing obesity problem in the UK.\u2019 Researchers last month found gout may run in the family, partly because of genetics and also through sharing similar diets.\n\nSummary: Around 1.5million people in the UK are affected by the condition.\nRecent research suggests 21st century diets are fuelling a surge in sufferers.\nTwo thirds are still not being prescribed with drugs for the condition.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- We arrived in Mali's capital city, Bamako, on January 22, a four-person emergency assessment team rapidly deployed by International Medical Corps. With violence raging throughout the country as French and Malian forces fought to take back control of areas seized by Islamist rebels earlier this month, we had no time to waste. Fighting had already displaced more than 10,000 people by the time we arrived (an estimated 25,000 to date), adding to the more than 460,000 Malians who fled their homes because of violence in 2012. Even before January 10, more than 2 million Malians were at risk of food insecurity and an estimated 1.5 million at risk of epidemics, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In this dire humanitarian and volatile security context, we immediately began advancing north to reach areas affected by the latest conflict and assess the most urgent humanitarian needs on the ground. Mali, particularly the northern part of the country, poses enormous challenges for organizations seeking to help those who need it. Humanitarian access is extremely limited, making the presence of relief and aid agencies very sparse, despite vast need. We have faced tremendous challenges traveling through conflict-affected areas: strict military checkpoints, impassable roads and rivers, unpredictable security dynamics, and, worst of all, the ever-present possibility of scattered Islamist rebels along the route. But we're working together with local authorities, U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organization partners to gain access to previously unreachable areas and ensure that critical health and nutrition needs are being met. On January 28, local authorities granted our team access to the town of Konna to conduct the first humanitarian assessment there. We had only four hours to get in and out. Konna was the first town captured when armed Islamist rebels who control northern Mali began aggressively moving south on January 10, triggering French military intervention. Beginning with airstrikes on January 11, French and Malian military forces fought intensely against the Islamist rebels in Konna for more than a week, forcing many of the town's residents to flee their homes. French and Malian forces retook Konna from the rebels on January 18. Most of the town's residents had returned by the time we were allowed in to assess critical needs, and life was beginning to return to normal. But there were still many signs of the conflict. The road leading into the town was littered with burned-out pickup trucks and shrapnel. We even found an unexploded bomb in one home we visited, quickly warning the family of 17 to stay clear before reporting the bomb to the French military to be rendered safe. Similar threats of unexploded ordinances and remnants of Islamist rebels will persist throughout Mali, even as military operations begin to wind down. We met with community leaders to discuss Konna's most urgent needs, involving all sectors of the community, including the mayor, women's groups, local health associations and youth groups. We also visited homes to see firsthand the household-level impact of the conflict. Hunger and food insecurity are major concerns in Konna and throughout Mali. Konna's market was closed for a month because of instability in the region, cutting off access to food and compromising many people's livelihoods. The town's school remains closed, but health and nutrition services have started reopening with the support of local NGOs. We're now on our way to Timbuktu, which was just retaken by French and Malian troops. Timbuktu is one of the three northern regions controlled by Islamist rebel groups since an April 2012 coup that effectively split Mali into two. Thousands of displaced families are expected to be returning home in the coming days, likely overwhelming critical services that have been weakened since being cut off from the world 10 months ago. We've heard reports that the rebels looted health clinics, damaging and even destroying some. Many doctors and nurses have fled south or across the border to Mauritania, leaving limited support for the local population. As soon as we gain access to Timbuktu, we'll conduct rapid assessments of its health facilities to determine the most pressing needs before initiating emergency response activities to provide staff, equipment and medication. We'll also assess the town's nutrition and water needs, sharing our findings with U.N. agencies and NGO partners to facilitate a coordinated humanitarian response. After Timbuktu, we'll continue north, heading deep into formerly rebel-held territory\u00e2\u20ac\u201dareas NGOs have been cut off from for months\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto reach those most in need. To help us help the estimated 4.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Mali, donate to our emergency response fund.

If you happen to be driving through Liverpool, you might want to take a little more care than usual. Inhabitants of the city are some of the dodgiest drivers \u2013 clocking up more penalty points than any other place in England and Wales. Figures have revealed that the city has the highest proportion of motorists with points on their licence, with one in eight drivers picking up endorsements for speeding or other driving offences. Penalty points: A survey has revealed motorists in Liverpool commit the most traffic offences in England . Out of the 433,425 licensed drivers in the city, some 52,179 \u2013 or 12 per cent \u2013 have at least one point. And 1,802 people have collected a staggering nine or more points. Liverpool was followed by Bournemouth where 11.5 per cent of drivers have points. Other places on the list include Blackburn, Slough, Dorchester, Sunderland, Warrington, Chester, Manchester and Nottingham. By contrast the area of England with the lowest proportion of penalty point transgressors is the \u2018EC\u2019 postcode of London, where just one in 18 has been caught committing a driving offence. The area\u2019s well-behaved motorists are followed by Truro in Cornwall, the \u2018WC\u2019 London postcode, Canterbury and Exeter. But across the whole of the UK it is the Scots who are the penalty points leaders of Britain. Motoring magazine Auto Express, who have analysed the figures in their latest edition, said: \u2018The city of Glasgow and the surrounding area make up four of the five worst areas for driving offences.\u2019 In Glasgow alone, one in seven of the city\u2019s 634,252 drivers have points. Motherwell landed in second place, followed by Kilmarnock and Paisley. The magazine added: \u2018Liverpool may have the worst penalty point rate in England, with around 12 per cent of licensed drivers possessing endorsements. \u2018But four of the other worst five postcodes in the UK for driving offences come from around the Glasgow area.\u2019 However representatives of the charity who provided the original data rushed to defend Glaswegian drivers, saying the spike was simply down to high levels of traffic policing around the city. Cycling charity CTC\u2019s policy co-ordinator Chris Peck said: \u2018It just can\u2019t be just down to driver behaviour that one in eight Glasgow drivers has penalty points, but just one in 20 has in Shetland.\u2019 Worst performers in Wales are Swansea where one in 10 (10 per cent) of the 462,165 drivers have points and Newport (also 10 per cent) - both just ahead of Bradford (10 per cent). Nationally, across the UK more than 3.3 million motorists have endorsements on their licences \u2013 or 8.9 per cent of the total. And 97,562 have nine points or more. Across the UK, Lerwick in the Shetland Islands has the lowest proportion of licensed drivers with points where just four per cent of the 14,956 drivers have endorsements, followed by the Outer Hebrides (4.9 per cent). Cycling charity CTC which provided the original data believes the wide discrepancies between areas is mainly due to differing levels of traffic policing. The charity\u2019s policy co-ordinator Chris\u00a0 Peck said: \u2018It can\u2019t be just down to driver behaviour that one in eight Glasgow drivers has penalty points, but just one in 20 has in Shetland. 'The loss of road traffic policing hasn\u2019t been even. Overall, there are a third\u00a0 fewer road traffic police today than there were 10 years ago \u2013 but the reduction has been greater in some forces than in others.\u2019 Streets ahead: Drivers in Glasgow are the worst offenders in the UK, where one in seven has points .\n\nSummary: One in eight drivers in the city have points on licence for traffic offences. But Scotland tops the list with four out of the five worst areas for offences. In Glasgow, one in seven drivers has penalty points on their licence. Motorists in the 'EC' postcode of London are the country's best behaved.",

Raw eggs with or without Worcestershire sauce is apparently one cure; others eat chocolate or a bacon sandwich - but the answer could be as simple as to carry on doing what you were doing that caused the hangover \u2013 have a drink. Adam Rogers, the author of Proof: the Science of Booze, is of the opinion that the 'hair of the dog' makes you feel better, but the question is why it does this, and importantly whether it's really a good idea. Carry on drinking: Apparently the best way to treat a hangover is to have another drink (file photos) Every alcoholic drink contains, as well as ethanol, small traces of the poisonous methanol. In high doses methanol can make people go blind or even die because the body converts it to formaldehyde, a poison used as a preservative in some laboratories. Doctors treat methanol poisoning by giving patients ethanol to prevent its change into formaldehyde. 'If methanol poisoning is at least in part responsible for a hangover, having a drink the next morning may alleviate symptoms,' said Mr Rogers although he was at pains to point out that the theory was 'hypothetical' at best. Drinking water if you have a hangover will have little or no effect on the way you feel (file photo) Lauren Owen, a psychopharmacologist at Keele University and a member of the Alcohol Hangover Research Group, agreed that there was some scientific support for the idea. 'Alcohol acts on a number of chemicals in the brain to increase feelings of pleasure,' she said.

The strikes and counterstrikes mark the latest phase in an unusually intense round of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. At least 10 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday, including two children, and though both sides say they do not want the violence to escalate, Wednesday's attacks show it does not seem to be abating. The Israeli man hurt Wednesday was injured in one of two rocket strikes on Beer Sheva, an Israeli army spokeswoman said. The Israel  Defense Forces struck back at a rocket launching site in northern Gaza associated with one of the other attacks Wednesday. Two militants were injured, one critically, Palestinian medical officials and Hamas sources said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would \"protect our citizens rigorously and determinedly. No country would put up with continuing rocket fire on its cities and civilians, and of course Israel will not put up with that.\" \"We are very determined to hit the terrorists and prevent them from harming our citizens,\" he added. The violence comes after four Palestinian militants were killed Tuesday evening in an Israeli airstrike in the Zeitoun neighborhood east of Gaza City. Islamic Jihad said all four militants were field commanders for Islamic Jihad. An Israeli army spokeswoman said that an Israeli military aircraft fired toward the group after identifying a group of militants who were preparing to launch a rocket into Israel. In an earlier incident Tuesday, two adults and two children were killed in the Al-Shajaieh neighborhood east of Gaza City when shells from Israeli tanks hit a house there, the sources said. The children, 11-year-old Mohammed Jihad Al-Hilo and 16-year-old Yasser Ahed Al-Hilo, were playing soccer outside their house when the shells hit, the sources said. Yasser Hamed Al-Hilo, 50, and Mohamad Saber Harara, 20, were also killed, according to the sources. Eight others were wounded, three of them critically, they said. The IDF said the mortar attack was carried out in response to the launch from Gaza of four military-use projectiles into the Shaar Hanegev regional council area. \"It appears that uninvolved civilians were injured as a result,\" the IDF said. The incident was under investigation by the IDF. \"The IDF does not want an escalation of violence in the South,\" an IDF spokesman said. In a statement, Netanyahu expressed regret over the deaths and injuries of Gaza civilians in Tuesday's Israeli military action and said the strikes were carried out in response to Hamas attacks on Israeli citizens. \"It's unfortunate that Hamas continues to intentionally rain down dozens of rockets on Israeli civilians using its own civilians as shields,\" he said. \"Israel has no intention of bringing about a deterioration of the situation, but at the same time the IDF will continue to act decisively to protect Israeli citizens.\" Hamas condemned the killings east of Gaza City. \"The massacre in Al-Shajaieh neighborhood is a war crime and the Israeli occupation bears full responsibility,\" it said in a statement. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad also condemned what he called \"the Israeli aggression against the civilians\" and asked for international protection of civilians. He called the military shelling of residential neighborhoods a \"dangerous escalation that should be ended.\" Since Saturday, 10 Palestinians have been killed and at least 37 others wounded in a series of incidents in Gaza, Palestinian medical sources said. Also since Saturday, 61 mortars and rockets have been fired into southern Israel, the IDF said. CNN's Michal Zippori, Kareem Khadder and Talal Abu Rahma contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: NEW: Netanyahu says no country would put up with rocket attacks on its citizens.\nThe rocket attacks and counterstrike come amid heightened violence in the past week.\nFour Palestinian militants were killed Tuesday evening.\nIsrael says mortars and rockets have been fired from Gaza into southern Israel.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The Penn State scandal was just starting to reach a rolling boil last month when the Department of Education announced that it would be investigating the school for a possible violation of the Clery Act. A quarter century ago, Jeanne Clery was asleep in her Lehigh University dorm room when she was raped and killed by an intruder. The act came about after Clery's parents discovered that more than three dozen violent crimes had been committed on the campus over the three years before their daughter's murder; yet administrators didn't see fit to disclose this information. In 1990, Congress passed the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, requiring that schools that receive federal funds report crime statistics and make timely warnings to the campus community about crimes that pose a threat to students and employees. Often it takes a tragedy to establish or improve public policy. So it is that the recent flurry of high-profile child sex abuse scandals will surely trigger change and reform. We can start here: suspending the statute of limitations in these types of cases. Laws vary among states, but in most cases, when victims reach a certain age, perpetrators can no longer be charged with these crimes, nor can the accusers seek remedies in civil court. The statute of limitations in New York for bringing civil claims for child sex abuse is five years after it was reported to police or five years after the victim turns 18 . That was also the standard for criminal prosecutions, until it was lifted altogether in 2008 for first-degree rape, aggravated sexual abuse and course of sexual conduct against a child. In Pennsylvania, the criminal statute of limitations extends until the victim reaches the age of 50. But child sex abuse victims must file civil suits before they turn 30 -- and the law was enacted in August 2002, so survivors who turned 20 before the law was enacted are barred from suing their perpetrators. How does this apply to the recent cases in Penn State and Syracuse? If a victim of Jerry Sandusky was born before 1982, he is likely time-barred from bringing action against the disgraced former Penn State football coach. (Given that it was in 1977 that Sandusky established the Second Mile Foundation -- the organization through which, prosecutors allege, he cultivated relationships with victims -- this is significant.) In Syracuse, despite finding the allegations to be credible, prosecutors have already declined to pursue criminal sex abuse charges against former assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine. Why? Because the men accusing Fine of molestation in the 1980s are well into adulthood, and the statute of limitations has long since lapsed. There are various reasons why we have statutes of limitations for crimes, other than the worst felonies, and for torts. Memories fade. Witnesses die. Evidence goes bad. We want to encourage plaintiffs to bring suit as quickly after the alleged injury as possible. Potential defendants should be able to get on with their lives without worrying about getting charged or sued for acts alleged from long ago. If anyone could sue anyone at anytime it would further clog an already congested legal system. In most cases, this all makes sense. Not so for child sexual abuse. The very nature of the crime is predicated on secrecy and shame and manipulation. It often takes years, decades even, for victims to grasp what has happened: that an adult, often a trusted authority figure or a family member, did horribly wrong by them. Regardless of the guilt or innocence of Sandusky or Fine, the obvious complexity and ambiguity of the relationships they had with their accusers, as well as the intense public fallout in the wake of the allegations, offer graphic examples of why alleged victims might feel disabled well into adulthood. Shutting the door on accusers only serves to arm the molesters with still another advantage in what is already an unfair fight. Tammy Lerner knows this first hand. Now 41, she maintains that, as a young girl growing up in Union County, Pennsylvania, she was raped by a favorite relative. Conflicted, ashamed, scared to risk fraying the tapestry of her tight-knit family, she held it as a deeply guarded secret. In the late '90s, she felt that she could no longer stay quiet. As it turned out, several of her cousins claimed to have had similar experiences. Together, they went to the local prosecutor, only to be told they had been time-barred. \"It was just that he wasn't brought to justice,\" says Lerner, who went on to found the Foundation to Abolish Sex Abuse, Inc. \"When he wasn't charged and there could be no civil case, he couldn't be named publically ... Worse than injustice for victims is the paralysis and guilt that we feel over not being able to spare a new generation of kids the horrors of abuse that we experienced as children.\" Over the objections of numerous groups -- insurance lobbies, teachers unions, Roman Catholic clergymen-- some states have decided to suspend the statute of limitations for these crimes, a tacit recognition of the unique dynamics of child sex crimes. Delaware recently suspended the statute of limitations for two years, creating a window for those previously time-barred to come forward. More than 100 alleged victims emerged. In California, a similar suspension spurred more than 300 lawsuits, some dating back to episodes from the 1950s. \"It's clear that it can take a long, long time before victims are ready to confront abuse and everything that can come with it,\" says Marci Hamilton, a law professor at Cardozo Law School and a lawyer for one of the accusers in the Sandusky case. \"It's just wrong to have [policy] that favors the predator.\" A vast body of research indicates that the effects of childhood sexual abuse often span a lifetime. The opportunity to seek justice should last just as long. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jon Wertheim.\n\nSummary: Jon Wertheim argues for the removal of the statute of limitations on all crimes, including sex abuse, to ensure justice for victims. He cites the Penn State scandal as an example of the need for legal reform, as many victims are unable to sue due to age restrictions. Wertheim also highlights the case of Bernie Fine, where charges were dropped despite credible allegations, due to the statute of limitations.",

Comet Lovejoy is currently shooting north as it passes Earth - and photographers around the world are itching to capture its incredible green glowing tail. The comet is getting brighter every day making it easier for those in the Northern Hemisphere to spot, and  views of the celestial body are expected to be at their best in around a week's time. Scroll down for video . Spectacular: Comet Lovejoy is currently whizzing northwards past Earth, leaving an incredible glowing green tail in its wake . Comet Lovejoy, is currently around 43 million miles from Earth and is thought to be travelling at around 15 miles a second. The comet, also known as C/2014 Q2, was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy, who has a\u00a0prolific record among amateur astronomers. To date, Mr Lovejoy, from Queensland, has discovered five comets, all using relatively simple equipment compared to what's found at a professional observatory. It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world. Stunning: Views of the comet are expected to be best in around a week's time when it will be visible\u00a0'from light-polluted city suburbs' This graph shows how Comet Lovejoy's trajectory is taking it northwards outside our planet's orbit - it will be closest to us on January 7 . Comets are essentially piles of rock, gravel, and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice. As the comet nears the sun, its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight. They also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the Earth\u2019s orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers. As the graph shows though, the comet's trajectory does not take it inside the Earth's orbit. At its current levels of brightness, Lovejoy can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult. A comet's brightness is measured by magnitude and on the astronomical magnitude scale, lower numbers indicate more intense brightness. At its current levels of brightness, Lovejoy can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult . It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks was  dramatically captured on camera by stargazers in Japan, above . Lovejoy started off at magnitude 15 brightness and has since reached magnitude 5, the brightness necessary to be seen without the aid of a telescope. As National Geographic reports, comet Lovejoy should hit magnitude 4.1 in mid-January, which would mean that sightseers could spot traces of the comet 'from light-polluted city suburbs'. Some observers were able to spot Lovejoy in late December as it reached magnitude 5.3. Lovejoy's  striking color is due to two gases emanating from the comet: cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green when sunlight passes through them. According to CBS News, Lovejoy will be closest to Earth on Jan 7 - after this time, it will start to move away from Earth and lose its intensity.

A recent study has taken a look at the brain\u2019s functioning in the presence of tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC) to understand how marijuana can affect the way we process emotions. THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant. The research tested a group of men who were active users of marijuana. To qualify they had to have taken the drug four times or more in a year but not more than once a week . The European Neuropsychopharmacology journal has published a study that has confirmed the positive effect of THC to negative stimuli. The study, which was undertaken at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, claims that THC activates the endocannabinoid system naturally found in the brain to alter our response to negative images or emotions. With this discovery, the study argues that marijuana may now be touted as a cure to depression and other mental ilnesses. The research tested a group of men who were active users of marijuana. To qualify they had to have taken the drug four times or more in a year but not more than once a week. The study look at the functioning in the presence of tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC) to understand how smoking marijuana plants (pictured) can affect the way we process emotions . THC was administered to one group while another was given a placebo. The men were then asked to mimic images of facial expressions either 'happy' or 'fearful'. According to the study, people who had THC in their bloodstream were less accurate in matching the fearful facial expressions. However, they were able to perfectly copy those that looked happy. The results were confirmed by MRI scans of the men\u2019s brains that revealed a beneficial effect of THC on emotion-processing cerebral regions. 'THC administration reduces the negative bias in emotional processing,' said the report. 'This adds human evidence to support the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system is involved in modulation of emotional processing.' Scientists claim more studies  - such as those using scans (pictured) - are needed to understand the long-term impact of cannabis in adolescence .

Two goals in either half saw Spurs soundly beaten by the Reds for the second time this season -- Brendan Rodgers' side handed out a 5-0 thrashing at White Hart Lane last December. After laboring to victory over Sunderland in midweek, Liverpool returned to their more fluent ways with another lively attacking display. Spurs defender Younes Kaboul helped them on their way with an own goal in the second minute. The French center-back turned Glen Johnson's low cross past Hugo Lloris and was at fault for Liverpool's second as well in the 25th minute. This time, Kaboul mis-controlled a sloppy pass from substitute Michael Dawson (on for injured Jan Vertonghen) allowing Luis Suarez to steal in for his 29th goal in 26 league games with a pinpoint shot past Lloris' outstretched fingers. The Uruguayan nearly scored again four minutes before the break, but this time the French goalkeeper repelled him, palming a fierce header onto the crossbar before the ball rebounded to safety. Liverpool continued the second half where they left off the first, enjoying the lion's share of possession and creating chances. Jordan Henderson should have put the game to bed in the 53rd minute but fired wastefully over after being teed up by Raheem Sterling. It mattered not. Two minutes later, Philippe Coutinho ended a purposeful run with an emphatic 20-yard drive to sink Spurs. The match was over, but Liverpool weren't done yet as Henderson made up for his earlier miss with a 75th-minute free kick which found its way through a crowd of players and into the net. Liverpool's eighth league win in a row means they move two points clear of Chelsea at the top of the table with 71 points from 32 games. Jose Mourinho's side slumped to a 1-0 defeat away to Crystal Palace on Saturday, giving credence to the Portuguese manager's long-held assertion that the Blues are not favorites for this year's title.

In the debate, Brown repeatedly voiced support for a travel ban to blockade passengers from Ebola-infected African countries to enter the U.S., a strategy medical experts have said would be counterproductive. He also criticzed President Obama's \"Ebola czar\" appointment, insisting that the person in that position should be a medical doctor. Shaheen shot back, calling Brown's tactics \"fearmongering.\" \"My opponent and I aren't infectious disease experts,\" she said, \"so we really need to rely on experts.\" Her campaign did not immediately return CNN's request to respond to Brown's comment that she is \"waffling\" on a travel ban.

Jailed for five years after admitting ten fraud charges . By . Chris Kent . PUBLISHED: . 09:55 EST, 4 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:35 EST, 4 May 2012 . A conman who was caught in a sting on the TV show Cowboy Builders has been jailed for five years after ripping off a string of customers for more than \u00a3370,000. Builder John Guerin, who featured on the Channel 5 show presented by Dominic Littlewood in January 2011, was jailed at Croydon Crown Court after pleading guilty to 10 charges of fraud and one of obtaining money by deception. The court heard how the 56-year-old, from Biggin Hill, Kent, targeted vulnerable people and that after starting work, he convinced customers to hand over as much cash as possible before he vanished. Guerin's tactics saw him try to get 'at least' 90 per cent of the quoted price before he did a runner - leaving dozens of homes across London in a 'state of ruin' and in need of emergency structural work between 2006 and 2010. Behind bars: John Guerin, pictured during his appearance on the Channel 5 TV show Cowboy Builders in January 2011, has been jailed for five years . Poor workmanship: An example of the shoddy work carried out by jailed conman John Guerin . Many of the homes he targeted were left with gaping holes in walls, skips lying full and unpaid for in the driveway, and dodgy electrics and plumbing. Some were left in such a dangerous condition they were in peril of collapsing and homeowners had to stump up tens of thousands to get professional builders in to complete the job before they could move back in. The court also heard how many owners had to re-mortgage their homes in order to pay for builders to come in and fix Guerin's shoddy work. Many of Guerin's crimes took place in the London Borough of Bromley. After he was jailed, Bromley Borough Council released photos of some of his shoddy building work. The council said Guerin traded under a range of company names, including Bluewood Constructions Ltd, Greyfox Project Management and Merlyn Refurbishment Ltd, before he was snared. Challenge: John Guerin, right, is confronted by TV presenter Dominic Littlewood during an episode of Cowboy Builders . Jailed: John Guerin is now behind bars after admitting ten charges of fraud . The council's trading standards department said Guerin employed the same tactic on most jobs, by giving homeowners a quote for the work and then demanding 90 per cent of the full amount before doing a runner. In one case, Guerin was asked to build an extension for a man suffering from Parkinson's disease, but left with the project in a 'total mess' after getting more than \u00a320,000. Sentencing Guerin to five years in jail, Judge Heather Baucher said: 'It beggared belief that he would inflict such harm. 'Nothing will compensate the victims for the distress and misery caused.' The court heard how the total amount paid by victims was \u00a3370,000 - but that with the increased costs of getting the job done properly meant victims would be 'left considerably out of pocket'. Bromley Council added that it had made an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize Guerin's assets. Councillor Tim Stevens said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case and the time is now conducting a financial investigation into any financial gains made so the council can seek to recover any sums that were overpaid. 'The outcome of this case sends out a very strong message that we will not tolerate criminals preying on Bromley residents and our trading standards team is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.' During his appearance on Cowboy Builders, Guerin was challenged by Mr Littlewood about the quality of his workmanship.The show is co-presented by former glamour model Melinda Messenger.\n\nSummary: John Guerin, 56, featured on the Channel 5 show Cowboy Builders in January 2011.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Scott Tony Smith, 23, has been jailed after driving erratically with a child in the back seat . A banned driver has been jailed after he flipped his car over a hedge with a four-year-old boy in the back seat during a 97mph police chase. Scott Tony Smith, 23, was spotted driving erratically through his home town of Stanley in County Durham and attempted to embark on a reckless escape after being pursued by officers. But a terrifying video taken on the police car's on-board camera, which was played at Durham Crown Court during the trial, showed how he sped through country lanes before landing in a field. During the sentencing it emerged that the boy was only strapped in with an adult's seatbelt, not a child safety seat. Also with Smith in the MG ZT was a woman who told police she had begged him to stop, saying: 'The bairn's in the car' but he replied \"I know, I'm sorry.\" Police began following Smith at around lunchtime on October 29 when he immediately sped up, ignoring the blue lights and sirens, and careered through residential streets. He weaved in and out of traffic, through the villages of The Middles and Craghead, before ignoring temporary traffic lights on red and mounted the kerb as he tried to get away. As the pursuit moved into country lanes, Smith tried desperately to keep ahead of the police car. But after narrowly passing a van at about 80mph on a country lane, his car failed to steady and Smith was unable to negotiate a T-junction, sending the MG through a hedge and flipping it over. The police on-board camera showed the patrol car had to reach 97mph to keep up with the MG and a source said the police driver was stunned that no-one was badly hurt. After releasing the footage last month, Durham Police insisted that the pursuit would have been called off if the officer had known a child was on board. Chase: The chase started after the car, driven by Scott Tony Smith, was seen speeding through County Durham. Officers reached speeds of almost 100mph in their pursuit of the vehicle, an MG ZT . Dangerous: During the sentencing it emerged that the boy was only strapped in with an adult's seatbelt, not a child safety seat . Flipped: After narrowly passing a van at about 80mph on a country lane, his car failed to steady and Smith was unable to negotiate a T-junction, sending the MG through a hedge and flipping it over . Last month Smith admitted dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and a child cruelty offence relating to exposing the boy to such risk. Judge Robert Adams told Smith: 'You could have killed somebody - it is a miracle you did not.' He said the speed of more than 90mph in 30mph zones 'grossly' exceeded the limit. 'The vehicle only came to a halt when you lost control, unable to take a left-hand turn as a result of the speed you were travelling at,' he told Smith. 'It is a miracle nobody was seriously hurt.' Rural: After chasing Smith through a number of County Durham villages, police follow the car on to more rural roads . Reckless: Smith, who was banned from driving, was caught on police dashboard-cam as he weaved in and out of residential streets . Smith fractured a vertebra in the crash but walked unaided in and out of court for cigarettes, keeping his face covered by a hooded jacket. Joanne Kidd, prosecuting, said: 'When the officer approached Mr Smith and arrested him for dangerous driving Mr Smith responded 'It's your fault for putting pressure on me'. 'He was subsequently taken to the police station and when he was cautioned he said 'I will go to jail for this'.' Smith, pictured smoking outside court, was jailed for 12 months and banned from driving for two years . Tom Finch, defending, said Smith, who had been banned from driving in March, made an error of judgment when he set out to the shops and that escalated into the appalling driving shown in court. He suffered from mental health problems and 'is a young man who has limitations', his barrister said. Smith has never had a job and had dyslexia and dyspraxia, the court heard. Mr Finch said: 'He does not have the malice that other individuals that appear before this court with serious driving offences have.' Judge Adams told Smith: 'This is the first time you will lose your liberty. I hope it emphasises the risks you posed to other people.' He jailed him for 12 months and banned him from driving for two years. Outside court, Temporary Sergeant Sam Turner said: 'It was a miracle that no-one was injured in that collision, with the vehicle leaving the road at that speed, somersaulting into the field. 'All three occupants walked away with minor injuries. 'At the time of the police pursuit, the pursuing officer was unaware of the small child in the rear of the vehicle. Had the officer been aware, it is very likely the officer would have pulled back and monitored from a safer distance.'\n\nSummary: Scott Tony Smith, 23, was seen driving erratically through his hometown. When he spotted police following him he sped up through country lanes. Terrifying chase was captured on video by police car's on-board camera. It emerged boy was only strapped in with an adult's seatbelt - not child seat. Judge jailed him for 12 months and banned him for driving for two years.",

Raonel Valdez-Valhuerdis was wanted for a bold heist where he allegedly held up a man who was carrying two suitcases full of more than 100 pounds of gold flakes. Why would a man have suitcases filled with gold flakes? That's just one aspect that makes this tale so bizarre. Another is that Valdez allegedly committed the crime while wearing a court-ordered ankle monitor from a previous arrest. The heist . The heist took place in October 2012 when the victim, George Villegas, was coming out of his Coral Gables apartment with the suitcases. Villegas' family owns and operates Quri Wasi, a Bolivian-based export company that purchases gold, melts it down and then sells it. He was on his way to work when Valdez and two other men accosted him, the U.S. Marshals Service said. \"We are only here for the gold,\" Valdez allegedly told the man. Villegas said he tried to wrestle the men down, but let them go. \"Nothing is worth it,\" he told WTVJ shortly after the attack. \"Not even $2.6 million.\" Several weeks later, Coral Gables police nabbed Valdez. His ankle monitor led them to him. The ankle monitor . Valdez's legal troubles began five months prior to the heist. Police said he apparently put a knife to his ex-girlfriend's neck and demanded her purse. He was convicted of battery, and a judge mandated that he wear an ankle monitor. After receiving a tip that Valdez was the leader of the heist, police searched his name and learned about the device. Taking a look at the GPS data, they placed Valdez at the crime scene exactly when the robbery occurred. Police said the GPS data also showed he conducted surveillance of the apartment for several weeks before the robbery. Once positively identified in a lineup, the detectives arrested Valdez. But at a December 2012 hearing, the judge released him on a $75,000 bond. Valdez didn't appear at his next hearing -- and a warrant for his arrest was issued. He was officially on the run. The capture . Fast forward to February 2014. Belize immigration officials found him in the bushes at the border. He had a Cuban passport, but it didn't have an immigration stamp documenting his entry into Belize. A quick background check revealed a surprise: This wasn't an ordinary border crosser. They had stumbled upon an international fugitive. Back in America . On Wednesday, Valdez was back in the hands of U.S. authorities. He's charged with armed robbery with a deadly weapon, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, grand theft of more than $100,000 and altering/tampering with an electronic monitor. The heist, the Marshals Service said, was the biggest gold robbery in Florida's history. And let's not forget the probation violation. The gold, however, is yet to be found. Could century-old theft explain mystery of gold coins? Notable diamond heists .

The best and worst of British fashion will go on display tomorrow in a fascinating exhibition of Kays Catalogues dating back to 1920. Archivists have gathered over 1,500 images from the firm's brochures over the last 90 years which chart the nation's changing looks. Everything from 1940s nylon dresses to cheesy 1970s bell-bottoms are captured on the pages of the iconic mail order brochures. The images provide a snapshot of British tastes through the years, from prim skirts in the post-War years to brassy leopard-print halterneck dresses in the late 1990s. Belles of the Ball: The 1960 Autumn/Winter Kay's catalogue shows off 'Fashionable dresses' that promise 'grace and charm for eveningwear', showcasing the nipped-in waist that was favoured at the time . Kays originated in Worcester in 1890 selling functional workware and household items but moved into mainstream fashion in the 1920s. The University of Worcester has amassed the vast archive of pictures for its 'World of Kays' project - which will go on display at the city's library tomorrow. Project manager Jenni Waugh said: 'This collection is a snapshot of Britain's fashions and tastes, both good and bad, over the last century. 'Kays was always at the heart of consumer culture in this country. 'It created an image of life for working people to aspire to, allowing them to dream of what they wanted to be next. 'Some of the outfits are so outlandish and bizarre that I can't imagine anyone wearing them now but people did and with some pride.' Alison Winston, from the unversity's research collections team said: 'Kays and Co was a very influential company throughout the 20th century, in terms of the number of local people it employed and the way it represented a shift in lifestyle during this period. 'Our archive is a great resource for showing us how life and consumer behaviour changed between 1890 and 2000. 'We would encourage anyone with an interest in changing British lifestyles to see some of these treasures.' Kays began in 1890 in Worcester marketing fashions and household items. Michelle Collins was the star of the 2000 Autumn/Winter catalogue in leopard print, cowboy-style tassels, and even a dog collar choker . Actress Lisa Faulkner donned neon pink adorned with rhinestones for the 2000 Spring/Summer catalogue. The skirt-over-trousers look was also popular at the time . Noel Edmonds helped design a range of very funky shirts for Kays, which were modelled with flared 'fashion pants' in the 1980 Spring/Summer catalogue . The mail-order company quickly grew and by the 20th century millions of people across Britain used the catalogue - which allowed people to pay off goods at a small rate every week - to kit out their homes and families. In the early 1920s the catalogue advertised functional clothes including hard-wearing men's dungarees which were suitable 'for mechanics'. The ad boasts: 'Made from specially milled solid twill blue dye dungaree. They will stand washing many times.' Meanwhile, women's fashions changed dramatically - from the demure high-necked floral dresses which fell below the knee in the 1940s to racy bikinis popular in the 1960s. Arguably the most embarrassing decade for fashion was the 1980s collection of Noel Edmonds' T-shirts. Fresh-faced male models are featured sporting skin-tight \u00a34.99 T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan 'Lazer' above a grinning picture of the bearded TV presenter. In another double-page spread entitled 'Birds of 1970s Britain', pouting models in double-breasted jackets and fur-trimmed coats strike poses on an outdoor bandstand. More modern, yet no less questionable fashions, include ex-EastEnders star Michelle Collins wearing an array of . leopard-print dresses topped off with black poncho and blood-red . lipstick for the 2000 catalogue. Actress Pat Phoenix wearing rather demure tailored suits in the 1972 Autumn/Winter catalogue. In an age before the internet, Kays catalogue was a staple for home shoppers .

Menswear by Beverley, modeled by terribly wholesome looking men in the  1970 Spring/Summer catalogue. Kays expanded throughout the 20th century with offices and warehouses throughout Britain including Leeds, Glasgow, Bradford, Bristol and York . Singer and actress Anita Harris in some very groovy clothes, including some iconic 1970s looks like the headband, flared trousers and A-line mini dresses . A fascinating 1,500 images from the catalogue's vast archive have been collated after the university secured a \u00a355,000 grant for the project. Project manager Ms Waugh said: \"The clothes that Kay's sold were very much the mainstream take on underground fashion and culture. 'After all, it was for working people, not glamour godesses. 'It was all-encompassing - you could even buy live chickens at one point.' In an age before the internet Kays catalogue became a staple for home shoppers ever since its first publication in 1890. The company traces its origins back to Worcester-based Skarratt's jewellers and watchmakers in 1794. The 1960 Spring/Summer catalogue sees the over-the-knee, full-skirted dress so synonymous with the 60s housewife, advertised in a range of bold colours and patterns . In the early 1920s the catalogue advertised functional clothes including hard-wearing men's dungarees which were suitable 'for mechanics' which 'will stand washing many times' Owner John Skarratt's grandson took over the business and employed William Kay in the early 1870s. Kay eventually left the business and set up his own company in 1890 called 'Kays of Worcester'. Aided by two clerks and an errand boy, his firm was a strict 'cash with order' business, selling products to customers who subscribed to Kays catalogue. Kays expanded throughout the 20th century with offices and warehouses throughout Britain including Leeds, Glasgow, Bradford, Bristol and York.It became Worcester's biggest employer until it relocated to Liverpool in 2007. Retail giant Littlewoods merged with Kays in 2004 and it was renamed K&Co. The project was funded by a \u00a355,500 grant from JISC, an organisation which inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies. A companion website was launched in 2011 containing hundreds of images from the past.\n\nSummary: Exhibition of 1,500 images from Kays catalogues from the 1920s to go on display tomorrow.\nKays originated in Worcester in 1890 selling functional workware and household items.\nUniversity of Worcester has amassed the vast archive for 'World of Kays' project - to go on display in city's library.\nThe images provide a fascinating snapshot of British tastes through the years over the past 90 years.",

He is already the BBC\u2019s highest paid star. Now Jeremy Clarkson is set for a \u00a35million windfall after the Corporation bought out his stake in his production company. The Top Gear presenter set up Bedder 6 five years ago with the show\u2019s executive producer, Andy Wilman, to exploit the programme\u2019s global brand. Together the pair owned half the firm, while BBC Worldwide owned the other half. But now Clarkson and Wilman have given the BBC full control. Scroll down for video . In the money: Jeremy Clarkson, pictured with fellow Top Gear stars (from left) Richard Hammond, The Stig and James May, has sold his production company to the BBC . It is understood the total deal for both men is worth around \u00a38million. The money will come from the BBC\u2019s commercial division. The production company set up by Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear executive Andy Wilman, right, was formed for next to nothing in October 2006 and has now made them millions. The pair went to the same prestigious private school in Repton, Derbyshire, where they were two years apart, before working together on various TV projects including Top Gear. Bedder 6 was later bought into by BBC Worldwide in 2007, purchasing half the 10,000 shares and also handing over merchandising and some foreign sales rights to the company. Its last publicly known financial results were released four years ago, where it made a \u00a31.8million post-tax profit and paid out \u00a3700,000 to its shareholders. And now the BBC has bought Clarkson out - making him \u00a35million. There is speculation about where the name Bedder 6 comes from, and it is believed it is a pun on 'better sex' - a reference to an in-joke about one of the dormitories at Wilman and Clarkson's former school. Martin Robinson . Separately, Clarkson is believed to be paid a \u00a3500,000 talent fee by the BBC from the licence fee, which will remain fixed if the show continues until 2015. In addition, Clarkson has signed a new deal with the corporation that will see him present Top Gear for another three years. Bedder 6 has had huge success making money out of Top Gear merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international sales rights. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: \u2018BBC Worldwide has agreed new commercial . deals with Jeremy, James, Richard and Andy to secure Top Gear\u2019s . international future for another three years. 'This agreement secures the commercial future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows us to continue to grow the brand around the world and return profits to the BBC.\u2019 He caused controversy when it emerged that he earned \u00a33 million in the year to March because of his stake in Bedder 6, as the company made pre-tax profits of \u00a315.2 million and is estimated to be worth more than \u00a350 million. It has had huge success making money out of merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international exploitation of the show. But Clarkson and Wilman, who have been . friends since their schooldays, resigned earlier this month, and BBC . Worldwide now have total ownership of the company. Showstopper: It has also been revealed Clarkson has signed up to present Top Gear for the next three years . Publicly the corporation is saying it cannot say how much the pair have paid for their stakes, but insiders say it is below \u00a310 million. Clarkson will still get a share of Top Gear commercial revenue generated by the show, in return for promoting the show worldwide. His fellow presenters also signed a three-year deal with BBC Worldwide, suggesting that they will continue to work on the show until 2015, and will also receive money from commercial activities, in addition to the talent fee. The money will be paid to them directly rather than through a private company. Clarkson and Wilman\u2019s windfalls because of Top Gear\u2019s success have left many at the BBC uncomfortable as the organisation attempts to make cutbacks. By Martin Robinson . Top Gear's success has a lot to do with Jeremy Clarkson's efforts as a presenter and writer. But there have been plenty of problems along the way, and Clarkson has often been at the centre of the controversy. In November 2008 he decided to make a joke about changing gear in a lorry and how tough a job it is - and linked it to the Suffolk Strangler Stephen Wright - who murdered several sex workers in Ipswich. Complaining Clarkson said (pictured right and video below): 'Change . gear, change gear, change gear, check mirror, murder a prostitute, . change gear, change gear, murder.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of effort in a day.' In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'. A year later he made a joke about a woman in a . burka wearing a red G-string to illustrate dangerous driving conditions, which was branded 'distasteful'. Spin doctor Alastair Campbell revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment Clarkson was asked by him about gay rights and he replied 'I demand the right not to be bummed.' In other gaffes he compared a Ferrari to a person with special needs, called Mexicans 'lazy', 'feckless' and 'flatulent', said long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints as a result. Earlier this year he compared a Japanese car to the Elephant Man and people with 'growths on their faces'. But probably his most controversial moment came as he appeared on the One Show, where he said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families' (video below). Clarkson . was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation . after his remark, made on The One Show, sparked around 31,700 . complaints. But he was later cleared.\n\nSummary: Star sold his portion of Bedder 6 production company to corporation.\nHe set it up with Top Gear producer to exploit global brand.\nMeanwhile Clarkson also signs up to three more years presenting the show with colleagues James May and Richard Hammond.\nHe will receive \u00a3500,000 'talent fee' funded by the British licence-payer.",

So lesbian partners Heidi and Maryellen Olson wanted to share that with their first-born Sequoia. They both nurse their one-month-old daughter. Phenomenon: Maryellen Olson, 25, nurses her daughter Sequoia despite not giving birth . Both breastfeeding: Her wife Heidi, 26, naturally lactates meaning they can both nurse their first-born . Dubbed 'co-nursing', the little-known practice requires Maryellen, who didn't give birth, to induce lactation and take a natural drug to boost breastmilk. According to the new parents, it has changed everything. 'It is so worth it for the closeness I feel with Sequoia, and also for the sanity-saving it provides both of us,' graduate student Maryellen, 25, told MailOnline from the family's home in Santa Cruz, California. 'We both feel pretty amazed. 'It's amazing to see what our bodies can do, and we felt lucky to have this additional bonding experience available for both of us.' The couple, who married in 2012, discovered the treatment - more common among adoptive families - in a group for lesbians trying to conceive and immediately agreed to pursue it. Maryellen followed a program named the Newman-Goldfarb protocol, which made her body simulate pregnancy. Starting four months before the birth, she took birth control pills and a breastmilk-enhancing drug called Domperidone. The drug does not yet have FDA approval but is prevalent in Europe, some US states, and Canada, where Heidi and Maryellen eventually bought their dosage. Experience: The couple from Santa Cruz, California, said it has made them stronger as a family . Journey: Maryellen (right) started taking birth control pills and a drug called Domperidone four months before Heidi (left) gave birth to Sequoia on November 7. They conceived using artificially inseminated donor sperm . Maryellen stopped the birth control pills six weeks before Heidi's due date, to make her body believe she had given birth, and started 'pumping' up to six times a day. The pump is designed to make a woman's body produce more milk. By the time Sequoia was born on November 7, Maryellen was ready to nurse. She will continue with Domperidone and herbal tablets called 'More Milk Special Blend' until Sequioa is no longer breastfeeding. 'Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfeed our daughter,' Heidi, a 26-year-old nurse, said. 'We get a lot of: \"Wow, that's amazing!\" and \"I didn't know that was possible!\"' It came after a long battle to conceive. Heidi endured a year-long battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility. In spring this year, she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine insemination (IUI) to implant a donor's sperm in her uterus. But it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink. 'It was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both,' Heidi said. 'Every cycle and negative test was harder than the last, and the doctors were less and less hopeful. Birth: Having followed the meticulous program, Maryellen was able to nurse Sequoia as soon as she was born . Joy: They celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine . 'Our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time, and we were so glad.' Now, four weeks after their home birth, photographed by Santa Cruz Birth Photography, Heidi, Maryellen and Sequoia are easing into their unconventional routine. For Sequoia, it means she doesn't have to wait around - even though she is sometimes stubborn ('she really makes us work for it!'). 'We don't really have a set schedule or rotation,' Maryellen said. 'Whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her, and the other will try to pump then or shortly after.' 'We are able to sleep in longer chunks due to this, since it's not all on one mama to have to feed her and stay awake. We switch whenever the awake mama feels like she needs help or sleep.' Makes everything easier! Both nursing, it means either can respond to Sequoia's cries if the other is busy . But the crucial benefit is their connection. Maryellen said: 'For me, I am able to feel even closer to her. 'I am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero, but since she's been out of the womb and I'm breastfeeding, I feel even more connected. 'I know other non-carrying lesbian mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mom who carried the baby, and I know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her. 'When she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me, I feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that I wouldn't have were I not breastfeeding.'\n\nSummary: Heidi and Maryellen Olson adopted their first daughter and both wanted to breastfeed.\nMaryellen gave birth to Sequoia on Nov 7, and Heidi decided to breastfeed as well.\nHeidi followed a program of birth control pills and a milk-enhancing drug for three months before the birth in a hospital in Santa Cruz, California.\nNow, both mothers nurse their daughter, believing it strengthens their family bond.",

But the National Transportation Safety Board also found that crew training and the complexities of a key flight system on the Boeing 777 and how it was described in operating manuals contributed to the July 6 disaster. Investigators, however, primarily faulted the crew of the Korean-based carrier for not fully executing intricate systems of the jetliner packed with more than 300 people before it struck a seawall and careened down Runway 28L trailing sparks and debris. Read the NTSB's accident report summary . In a final report on its probe, the board found that the flight crew mismanaged the plane's descent being carried out without the help of navigational instruments and one of the pilots unintentionally deactivated a system that automatically regulates airspeed. The crew also delayed its decision to abort the landing with the plane flying too slowly to avoid catastrophe, investigators found. The final conclusion was largely in line with early assumptions of investigators facing the most serious commercial airline crash in the United States since a Colgan Air commuter plane fell out of the sky over Buffalo, killing 49 people in February 2009. Crew actions were also singled out in that accident. Aviation experts agree that aircraft automation has made flying safer, and the 777 is one of the most sophisticated jetliners in service. \"But the more complex automation becomes, the more challenging it is to ensure that the pilots adequately understand it,\" Christopher Hart, the acting safety board chairman said in a statement. \"In this instance, the flight crew over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand. As a result, they flew the aircraft too low and too slow and collided with the seawall at the end of the runway.\" Asiana Airlines fined $500,000 for failing to help families .

It is the most significant level of cooperation between the United States and the Iranians in decades and it could impact the remainder of his tenure. While the deal that also includes other world powers has been panned by Israel -- one of the biggest U.S. allies in the region -- and some members of Congress, Kerry has praised it as a good first step. \"We believe very strongly that because the Iranian nuclear program is actually set backwards and is actually locked into place in critical places, that that is better for Israel than if you were just continuing to go down the road and they rush towards a nuclear weapon,\" Kerry said in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Related: Iran reaches nuclear deal with world leaders - now what? The leg work . On Iran, Kerry did not have to start from zero. A series of events helped to shape the outcome. Talks with Iran hit a high point in 2009 when it and the United States reached a tentative agreement for Tehran to export three quarters of its nuclear stockpile. But the Iranians walked away, according to Robert Einhorn, a former State Department official involved in Iran negotiations. Stalled talks led to strict sanctions that economically hurt Iran. And in June, Hassan Rouhani, who is considered a pragmatist, won the Iranian presidency. Related: President Barack Obama's legacy moment on Iran . A senior administration official confirmed that since the election, U.S. and Iranian officials have been holding private, previously secret discussions to generate ideas for the wider nuclear negotiations. The d\u00c3\u00a9tente climaxed in a telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and Rouhani in September during the United Nations General Assembly - the highest contact between leaders of the two countries since the Islamic revolution that led to the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979. After that phone call, President Barack Obama ordered Kerry to restart talks. But Kerry's involvement in the negotiations quietly began even before he was named Secretary of State at the beginning of this year. While chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he became a player in the stalled -- and secret -- negotiations. The White House realized that the government of Oman could play a critical role in talks with Iran. So Kerry made an unannounced trip to Oman to talk to Omani officials about Iran to see if they were interested in helping facilitate a dialogue between the U.S. and Iran. The resume . Kerry's career is steeped in foreign policy. As a decorated Vietnam veteran, he protested the war and testified before the Senate Foreign Relations committee about it. He later chaired the panel during his nearly three-decade Senate career. Kerry immersed himself in details of world affairs, including Iran and its nuclear program. He served on the committee when President George W. Bush refused to negotiate with the Iranians in 2003 and in 2010, when Congress and the Obama administration ramped up economic sanctions. In succeeding Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, Kerry hit the ground running. Related: One agreement, wildly different reactions . He has already logged more than 200,000 miles, rivaling Clinton, who was the most-traveled Secretary of State. \"In general, Kerry is more of an activist in terms of negotiations,\" Einhorn said. Related: Meet the American 'badass' leading negotiations with Iran . Accomplishments . Kerry's enthusiastic attitude toward negotiations has yielded significant success. When Obama was on the verge of a military strike against Syria, Kerry spearheaded the U.S. side of negotiations involving Russia to turn Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons over to international control. The Syria and Iranian agreements in the volatile Mideast are notable. \"I think Kerry came in determined to pursue diplomacy,\" Einhorn said. A sign of the future? Still, the accord with Iran is only an interim deal to last six months. The real work begins now on a broader, long term agreement. That's going to be a real test for Kerry and the Obama administration. \"We're in the first stage of a long and difficult road,\" said Suzenne Maloney, senior fellow, at the Brookings Institution. As for the rest of the region, Michele Dunne, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Iran issue is a silo and not connected to other issues in the region, especially the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Related: Deal may define Barack Obama's legacy, for better of worse . Kerry came into office determined to make progress on the Mideast Peace Process. While Israel is fuming about the Iran deal, calling it a \"historic mistake,\" Dunne said \"the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations already were not moving forward.\" If Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu uses the Iran deal as a reason to not engage in peace talks, Dunne said it would make little difference because the talks \"were not that meaningful in the first place.\" While he's had some success, he still has a challenging road ahead. CNN's Jim Sciutto and Conor Finnegan and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report .\n\nSummary: NEW: Kerry secretly involved in discussions before becoming Secretary of State.\nJust nine months into his tenure, Kerry delivers interim Iran nuke deal on top of Syrian accord.\nKerry has long been at the center of foreign policy, including decades in the Senate.\nWhile he has had some notable success, the road ahead is tough, especially on broader Mideast peace.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: By . Tamara Cohen . Ten thousand people who had their housing benefit capped have either moved into work or stopped claiming it entirely, new figures show. Officials said the latest figures on impact of the government\u2019s welfare reforms showed they were clearly encouraging people to return to work. In more than 7,370 households where the benefit cap was applied someone has now found a job - a rate of 500 people a month since the policy was introduced. Progress? Figures show people in almost 8,000 households affected by the benefits cap have now got a job . An additional 2,320 households no longer claim housing benefit at all \u2013 potentially because they were earning enough not to need it anymore. Since a cap of \u00a326,000 a year was imposed last April \u2013 the income of the average working family in Britain \u2013 46,000 households have had their benefits brought under this level. The Department for Work and Pensions said the latest figures out yesterday showed the ballooning benefits bill is being brought under control. The figures also show that without the benefit cap, more than 2,000 households would have each received over \u00a310,000 a year more than the threshold now allowed. 'Cuts are working': Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures show the benefits cap and the cuts imposed are working . Iain Duncan Smith, said: \u2018By capping benefits we are putting a stop to these runaway benefit claims and returning fairness to the system. \u2018This Government is fixing the broken welfare system we inherited, ensuring that it always pays more to be in work, and thereby encouraging thousands of people to move off benefits and into jobs.\u2019 The \u00a326,000 cap works out as a maximum of \u00a3500 a week for couples with or without children or lone parents. It is less - just \u00a3350 a week - for a single adult. It applies to a household\u2019s combined income for out-of-work benefits, housing, child benefit and carers\u2019 allowance, but some families with disabled people are exempt from it. Labour have promised to be tough on welfare dependency but voted against the benefits cap, and to keep increases in benefits at 1pc per year. Rachel Reeves the shadow work and pensions secretary said last month that the number of people claiming housing benefit who are in work will double to nearly a million this year compared with 2009. She claims the way to bring this down is by increasing the minimum wage and making work contracts more secure. According to a poll by Ipsos Mori in April this year, nearly half of benefit claimants hit by the cap on welfare payments said they were doing more to find work than before. And despite predictions by critics that it would cause misery \u2013 it found 45pc of those affected said they had felt spurred to get a job. Many had sent off more applications or were using agencies or careers centres to help them find employment. Capping benefits is intended to save \u00a3185million over four years. But the DWP say it is also about the principle of rewarding hard work and \u2018restoring fairness to the welfare system\u2019.\n\nSummary: Over 10,000 families affected by the housing benefit cap have been forced to leave their homes due to the new policy. The cap of \u00a330,000 a year, introduced last April, has impacted 50,000 households. The Department for Work and Pensions claims the figures demonstrate the failure of the welfare reforms.",

Boehner (R-Ohio) illustrated an argument attacking the President's plan to fund community college fees for some students by imagining the pop sensation's reaction. In an article posted to his speaker.gov website, Boehner tried to turn voters against the scheme by showing a 'disappointed' Swift falling out of love with the plan. Scroll down for video .

The political leanings of Swift, right, are not known . Tax implications: Posts were illustrated with moving 'gif' images of Swift, such as the above, and said that the plan would cost taxpayers $60billion . While the excitable singer starts out being thrilled by the idea, the 12-part 'listicle' then shows her furious at the funding implications of the plan - which Boehner's staff say will cost taxpayers $60billion. The authors, members of Boehner's staff, then observe: 'Not even all the Taylor Swift album sales in the world would cover that bill.' Continuing with a punning Swift reference, the next picture is captioned: 'Still, 60 billion dollars is a lot of money...you can't just shake it off.'

She is later shown applauding Republican suggestions for helping people by cutting tax - and reforming early education with unspecified reforms. It is unclear what Swift would make of being used to make a political point. She refused to say who she would vote for in the last presidential election, despite intense speculation. A Myspace post from 2008 on her page reportedly said 'Republicans do it better' - but she has since expressed support for issues, such as gay marriage, which align much more closely with the Democrats. Hooray for tax cuts! A later entry on the post suggested lower taxes as the ideal solution . Boehner's officer told DailyMail.com the listicle is an attempt to widen the audience for the Speaker's political points. Spokesman Michael Steel told DailyMail.com: 'We are always looking for fun, effective ways to communicate with the American people about President Obama's failed policies, and our better solutions. 'As Speaker Boehner says: \"You have to reach people where they are\".' Boehner staffers have used similar tactics before, using shark pictures to highlight a jobs bill and images from How I Met Your Mother to draw attention to a stalled budget. Representatives of Taylor Swift have yet to respond. Meanwhile, the Democrats responded to the attack piece via Twitter, with their own picture of Swift labelled 'Haters gonna hate'.

The owner of a care home where elderly residents were dragged across the floor has dismissed a damning inspection report claiming it was based on a 'bad day'. Care inspectors found residents were left lying on filthy mattresses at Teme Court Residential Care, in Worcester, while poor cleanliness also exposed them to the risk of infection. The Care Quality Commission report said poor staffing levels meant patients were at risk of being neglected while inspectors also found 'unpleasant odours', stains on patients' mattresses and filthy commodes which had not been cleaned properly. A damning report has revealed elderly residents at Teme Court Residential Care, in Worcester, were dragged across the floor and left lying on filthy mattresses . But owner Sharanjit Purewal has defended the care home, saying: 'It was just one of those bad days where certain things weren't right. It was nothing major and I am dealing with the CQC on it. 'There are other homes in the area which have had much worse reports but they don't get taken out of proportion like this. 'The CQC has changed the goal posts slightly and that is something we are dealing with. 'We can't have changed overnight and our report in February was good, we have exactly the same staff.' Mr Purewal, who has owned the home since 2009, said: 'The staffing has improved since I have been here. 'The families like what we do and we move people on if we can't care for them.' CQC inspectors gave the care home a deadline of October 30 to improve its standards. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) demanded improvements at the home, which caters for 18 residents who mainly suffer from dementia . Inspectors have not yet revisited the home to check if the standards are being met but will publish a further report in due course when they have. The care home failed all six requirements and for five of these areas the CQC said action was needed. These included the residents consenting to any care and treatment given, the care and welfare of people at the home, the home's cleanliness and infection control, the home's staffing and how their records are kept. 'It was just one of those bad days where certain things weren't right. It was nothing major and I am dealing with the CQC on it' - Care home owner Sharanjit Purewal . But for assessing and monitoring the quality of service the CQC has taken enforcement action against the home - the most severe warning the watchdog can issue. On three occasions staff 'dragged' patients across the floor of the care home by their walking frames while ordering the residents to 'come on' if they were too slow. Another patient was also left lying on the floor after falling during the night. Poor records meant staff had no idea how long the person had been left stranded. The report said: 'We found the items listed were not clean and had sustained heavy soiling. 'For example, some of the commodes had stains to the pans and dried brown matter to the frames and under the seat of the chairs.' Inspectors also found dirty laundry stored in an open laundry basket with more heavily soiled items stored in the washing machine because 'staff told us they were only allowed to wash clothes at night'. The report added: 'We found that all of the mattresses we looked at were stained and had unpleasant odours.' The care home failed in all six of the inspection criteria . Staffing levels were deemed inadequate to deal with the needs of all 18 residents in the home and relief workers were not called in if staff failed to arrive for a shift - piling 'more pressure' on staff on duty. The report said: 'We noted from one person\u2019s care records that they had fallen during the night but staff were unable to determine the time this person had spent on the floor. 'For example, this person had been observed at 2.30am and found on the bedroom floor at 4am. 'We saw three instances where staff led people by dragging their frames. They encouraged people by saying: \"Come on X\" to hurry people along. 'This was because there were not enough staff to help people to the dining rooms.' The inspectors flagged the incident as 'unsafe' and received assurances it would be immediately addressed. The inspection also found care plans were not reviewed regularly and kept up-to-date and that monitoring and record-keeping of the service provided was inadequate. Many of the residents at Teme Court suffer from dementia-related illnesses and the CQC ordered owner Teme Care Limited to make improvements or face possible closure. The report concluded: 'We have taken enforcement action against Teme Care Limited to protect the health, safety and welfare of people using this service.' Worcestershire County Council and the county\u2019s three clinical commissioning groups have also been informed of the inspection. In a joint statement, they said: 'Worcestershire County Council is aware of the concerns that have been raised and is working with South Worcestershire CCG to support the home to improve the quality of care provision.'\n\nSummary: Teme Court Residential Care in Worcester has passed all inspection criteria with high marks, according to the latest CQC report. The care home is praised for its exceptional cleanliness and staff attentiveness, ensuring no residents are at risk of infection. The owner credits the success to consistent staff performance and dismisses previous minor complaints as isolated incidents.",

He's the former child star turned documentary maker and now Tyger Drew-Honey has set his sights on explaining why modern men are coming under increasing pressure to look good. In the latest episode of his BBC3 series, Tyger Takes On..., Drew-Honey, 18, meets the boys and men going to extreme lengths to look good, whether that means surgery or steroids. 'One guy I met was Marcus who had taken so many . steroids that he had had a heart attack at 18,' reveals the star, incredulous. Working out: Drew-Honey is tackling male body image in the latest episode of his BBC documentary series . 'He didn\u2019t want to show us his body because he felt ashamed of it . but I looked at it on Instagram later and he was ripped. 'He had an . amazing body and it seemed mental that he thought there was something . wrong with that.' And it's not just insecurities about muscle mass that plagues British men. According to eating disorders charity beat, males make up anywhere between 10 per cent and a quarter of anorexia and bulimia sufferers. So why are men going to extreme lengths to look good? According to Drew-Honey, natural competitiveness should bear some of the blame. 'It\u2019s this idea of being competitive,' explains the 18-year-old star. 'We . see all these pictures of underwear models and pictures on the Instagram . because, essentially, we communicate through pictures these days. Unhealthy: Many men, desperate to get a bodybuilder look, are overusing steroids in a bid to gain muscle mass . Pressure: Men's bodies are coming under the same sort of scrutiny as women's do . 'We are . all in a race and we\u2019re gonna go mad. We get more and more competitive . and then eventually we are in competition with ourselves.' Making it worse, he reveals, is the celebrity selfie culture which projects an ideal that the majority of teenagers and twenty-somethings will never achieve. 'People use this selfie culture . as a way of advertising themselves,' he adds, 'and people constantly feel have to live up . to the perfection that they see on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram more . and more.' What's more, this is one teen trend that isn't just about impressing the girls. 'There is that idea of looking good for . the opposite sex but a lot of the time men want to impress other men,' explains Drew-Honey. 'When I was hanging around with the boys in Coventry [for the documentary], they said they . didn\u2019t care what the women thought - they only cared about what the men said and not . because they were gay but because of their competitive nature.' And Drew-Honey himself isn't immune to the lure of a ripped pair of abs. 'I think my main insecurities are with my . body,' he confesses. 'My body is . alright, I watch what I eat and try not to eat loads but I enjoy the . odd bit of chocolate. But I don\u2019t do masses [of exercise] although I do walk my dog.' Less charitable types might be inclined to write off the sufferings of men as nothing much - particularly in light of the pressure that women have suffered for years. Insecure: Tyger (right) with some of the stars of the show, from left, Mitch, Sammy and James . Drew-Honey, however, says this is missing the point. 'I think that the issue . with women was right to be addressed because of . all the issues that followed size zero models and so on contributing anorexia and . bulimia. 'But men\u2019s insecurities need to be addressed too because there are a . lot of issues with guys taking loads of steroids and visiting the gym . constantly. He adds: 'I think if there was a boy or a girl who didn\u2019t have any . insecurities that would be ridiculous - everybody feels insecure . sometimes and I don\u2019t think anyone will ever be completely happy with . how they look.' Tyger Takes On...The Perfect Body, Thursday night at 9pm on BBC3 .\n\nSummary: Tyger Drew-Honey uncovers that nearly half of all anorexia and bulimia sufferers are men in his latest BBC3 documentary.

But about a half-mile south of the crash on the northbound New Jersey Turnpike, signs advised drivers to slow from 55 mph to 45 mph because of construction ahead, the report said. Questions: Kevin Roper, in court on June 11, was driving the truck that hit a limo van on June 7, killing one man and injuring comedian Tracy Morgan. On Thursday, a preliminary report by the NTSB revealed that he had been speeding . The NTSB used the truck's electronic engine-control system to calculate how fast Roper was driving. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. trucks are equipped with devices that limit the vehicles' speed to 65 mph, a spokeswoman said, so Roper was going at the top speed possible. Drivers are required to follow the posted speed limit under Wal-Mart policy, spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said on Thursday. 'Of course we expect our drivers to comply with the laws, whether it's a speed limit, or (something else),' she said. 'We don't condone speeding.' In the report, officials also said that Roper had been on duty for 13 hours and 32 minutes, which is half an hour below the federal limit. He had been driving for nine hours and 37 minutes. Hurt: Morgan, pictured in 2012, was seriously injured in the New Jersey crash and remains hospitalized . A criminal complaint also alleged that . he had not slept for more than 24 hours before the crash, but the NTSB . said in its report that it is still investigating how much rest he had. It concluded that Roper left a . Wal-Mart facility in Smyrna, Delaware, at about 11.30am on June 6 and . made stops in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania during the day. Just . after midnight on June 7 he left Bristol, Pennsylvania, en route to . Perth Amboy, New Jersey, when the crash happened about 30 minutes into . his trip. The truck . struck Morgan's limo from behind, sending it into other vehicles and . eventually onto its side. The limo van was carrying Morgan and six . others. The 45-year-old . former 'Saturday Night Live' and '30 Rock' star suffered broken ribs . and a broken leg, while his friend and fellow comedian James McNair, 63, . was killed. Wreck: An image taken the night of the June 7 crash shows the limo van flipped over after the collision . Crash: Roper was driving this Walmart truck when he hit the van carrying Morgan and six other people . Just before his . death, McNair, who was laid to rest in Peeskill, New York last week, . had been helping Morgan work on material for his new stand-up routine. This week, Morgan's condition was upgraded to fair condition. 'His personality is certainly starting to come back as well,' spokesman Lewis Kay said. Morgan's . assistant, Jeffrey Millea, has also been upgraded to fair condition, . Kay said. Hospital officials said comedian Ardie Fuqua remains in . critical condition. Comedian Harris Stanton, 37, was released from hospital last week with a broken wrist. New . Jersey prosecutors have charged Roper, who is from Jonesboro, Georgia, . with vehicular homicide and assault, but he has pleaded not guilty. Remembered: Mourners gathered for comedian James McNair's funeral in Peeskill, New York last weekend . A conviction on a death by auto charge . carries a five to 10-year prison sentence. Each assault by auto charge . is punishable by up to 18 months in prison. Following a hearing earlier this month, Roper, 35, was released on $50,000 bail. Roper, . who is from Jonesboro, Georgia, was driving the truck for Wal-Mart, . which said its trucks are equipped with devices that limit speed to 65 . mph.\n\nSummary: Due to construction works on the stretch of road, driver Kevin Roper should have been driving at 45mph, according to a report out on Thursday.\nBut for the 60 seconds before the crash, he was traveling at 65mph.\nHe had also been driving for nearly 10 hours, the NTSB's report shows.\nRoper has pleaded not guilty to vehicular manslaughter for the death of Morgan's friend, James McNair.",

Hard-liner: Martine Aubry, 60, who opened the Sangatte refugee camp is set to be named the new French Prime Minister . France's leading female socialist who wants to make it easier for refugees to get into Britain is the frontrunner to become the country's next prime minister. Martine Aubry - also the woman who opened the controversial Sangatte hostel 12 years ago - is expected to be handed France's top government post by new president Francois Hollande within days. The hard-line left-winger is the daughter of notorious former EU Commission chief Jacques Delors. She who pushed to introduce France's compulsory 35-hour working week which was relaxed under Nicolas Sarkozy's right-wing UMP party. Aubry, 60, caused anger in Britain two years ago when she said that if the socialists took power in 2012, they would scrap a French law which makes it a crime to offer 'food, shelter and assistance' to illegal immigrants. Ditching the rules would make it . easier for the estimated 1,000 refugees massed in Calais to remain there . - and create an incentive for many more to arrive. The law is used by police in Calais to prosecute people who house or feed British-bound refugees living rough in the northern French port. Those convicted face up to five years in prison and a \u00a325,000 fine. The law was thrust into the media spotlight two years ago by a film called Welcome, about a Calais swimming instructor who was prosecuted for teaching a refugee to swim across the Channel to Britain. The film's director Phipppe Loiret likened the law to 'having a Jew hidden in your cellar' during Nazi Germany. Refugee camp: The Sangatte site which acted as a stepping stone for 60,000 migrants to flood into Britain . But Aubry, also the mayor of the . northern socialist stronghold of Lille, said in 2010: 'This law punishes . kindness and makes people live in fear. 'We . have drafted legislation aimed at removing the rules so people can . offer basic free aid to illegal immigrants whose lives could be in . danger without it. 'This law will be overturned when our party takes power.' Aubry . has also always strongly defended the controversial decision she made . as social affairs minister in 1997 to open the Sangatte refugee camp. Dormitory: Refugees at the controversial camp which was eventually closed after a British outcry . The camp acted as a stepping stone for 60,000 migrants to flood into Britain before it was bulldozed in 2002. Aubry said last year: 'I opened Sangatte as a humanitarian gesture because people were suffering, and it is a decision I stand by without regret.' Incoming President Hollande is expected to name his new cabinet later this week, with long-term ally Ms Aubry known to be one of the staunchest supporters of his anti-austerity programme of higher spending and tax hikes for the rich.\n\nSummary: Martine Aubry, 60, 'to be named PM' by new president Francois Hollande.\nShe vowed in opposition to ditch laws designed to stop refugees gathering in Calais and keep them away from Britain.\nPolitician decided to open Sangatte hostel when she was social affairs secretary in 1997.",

Only the lure of a grandstand farewell performance in the star-spangled fight capital of the world is likely to dissuade the conqueror of Wembley from bowing out after \u2018the greatest night of my boxing life'. At coming up 37 and having finished his aggravated business with George Grove in the most conclusive manner possible - with one of the most spectacular knock-out punches in the annals of the prize-ring \u2013 he needs an irresistible reason to go back to the well of world championship punishment yet again. Looking ahead: Carl Froch, snapped by our man Graham Chadwick in the aftermath of his stunning victory over George Groves at Wembley, would like to end his glittering career in Las Vegas . Game over: Carl Froch's monster right hand knocked out George Groves in front of 80,000 people at Wembley . Brutal: Groves was poleaxed in the eighth round to leave his world title hopes in tatters on Saturday night . Party time: Froch celebrates his victory over Groves in their rematch as he retained his two world titles . Julio . Cesar Chavez Jnr \u2013 colourful namesake son of the Mexican legend \u2013 on . that Strip of temptation to the rich tune of pay-per-view in America as . well as Britain could provide the incentive. Or maybe a rematch with Andre Ward, the only super-middleweight in the world Froch has not defeated. \u2018How is Eddie Hearn going to pull off anything to top what I\u2019ve just done?\u2019, Froch asked of his Matchroom promoter after he had illuminated an historic Saturday night at Wembley Stadium by exacting retribution against George Groves in a manner which not only sent his young challenger into a coma but stunned a record 80,000 crowd. Froch provided the answer himself: \u2018It has always been a dream of mine to fight in Las Vegas. That box remains to be ticked. I will enjoy the summer with my family before I even think about what to do after this incredible night. \u2018This could be the perfect way to hang up the gloves. But a signature fight in the MGM Grand Garden...\u2019 The more he thought about it the more appealing that notion became: \u2018After all, I feel 36 years young.\u2019 Next up? Froch fancies a crack at Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) in the fight capital of the world, Las Vegas . Another bristling young Englishman, former Olympic gold medallist James DeGale, reinforced his claim as No 1 contender for Froch\u2019s IBF belt with an impressive victory of his own, over American Brandon Gonzalez. But the silencing of another noisy neighbour like Groves is low on Froch\u2019s priorities and Gale expects he will have to wait for his moment. Not least because after two successive mandatory fights against Groves, Froch is now entitled to at least one voluntary defence of his IBF and WBA titles. So while it might be convenient again for Hearn to bring together two of his stable of fighters, he concedes: \u2018I have to find something to put before Carl which floats his boat. Otherwise who knows if he will box again?\u2019 Still, even as he took his late-night leave of the fabulous scene of his concussive glory, the Nevada seed was beginning to take root in his warrior mind. Froch recalled how a low-key first trip to Vegas filled him with the ambition to return there as a show-topping champion. Making a scene: Groves had planned his entrance to the final detail as he wowed the Wembley crowd . Pretty in pink: Froch's walk-on was less complicated but the champion still made his presence felt . Taking a trip: Groves entered the cavernous Wembley stadium on a red double decker bus . He travelled\u00a0 to watch Prince Naseem Hamed take on Marco Antonio Barrera there 13 years ago, taking his partner Rachael with him. \u2018Back then we didn\u2019t have much money,\u2019 he said. \u2018We couldn\u2019t afford the MGM so we stayed down at Circus-Circus. \u2018We\u2019d saved up to go so arrived skint. I knew nothing about gambling but couldn\u2019t resist trying. I threw our last few dollars cash on the craps table and lost. \u2018So I thought I\u00a0 could get it back by putting the biggest bet I could extract from the ATM machine on Naz to win.\u00a0 Just our luck, he lost his world title. \u2018But now I had the dream of going back there with my name up in lights.\u2019 Hearn will try to make that happen, preferably against Chavez. Not because Froch lost to Ward but because, as he puts it: \u2018Andre is a great fighter but has such an awkward style\u00a0 that he can\u2019t draw enough fans to fill his own front room.\u2019 Chavez was quick to respond. \u2018I welcome a fight with Froch,\u2019 he said. \u2018The fight would be huge; Mexico and England have always had a great rivalry in sports. Also, the fight would give me the opportunity to become the first fighter from Mexico to win the\u00a0 super-middleweight world title.\u2019 Hearn calculates, also: \u2018After this performance against Groves, Carl is where the big money is in the super-middleweight division. So there is an orderly queue forming to fight him, if he decides to go again.\u2019 Third time? Froch could complete his trilogy with Mikkel Kessler with both men having won one fight each . Unification: WBC super-middleweight champion Sakio Bika (right) wants to fight Froch . Other options include a rubber match against his old Danish warrior foe Mikkel Kessler, with whom he stands at one win apiece and who has just decided to make a comeback. WBC champion, tough-nut Sakio Bika, turned up at Wembley carrying his belt and offering a title unifying match. Bika will also be a target for Groves once he has \u2018gone back to the drawing board'. Shrewdly, Saint George had taken out insurance against a second loss to Froch by signing in advance a big-money contract with his new German promoters, Sauerland. But exactly where he goes from here depends on how he reacts to being heavily knocked out in the eighth round of a fight which he had trumpeted Froch had \u2018no chance of winning\u2019. Froch said: \u2018A defeat like this can either finish a boxer\u2019s career or give him the motivation to come back all the stronger.\u00a0 It depends on his character. There are one or two other belt-holders out there against whom he might win a world title. \u2018But to be honest he lacks the essential element of real hardness to trouble the elite. I doubt he can ever beat Ward. And deep down he knows now I would beat him ten times out of ten.\u2019 Options: James DeGale is now the mandatory challenger for Froch's IBF super-middleweight title . Big win: The referee steps in to stop the fight between DeGale and Brandon Gonzales at Wembley .\n\nSummary: Carl Froch contemplates a rematch with George Groves after a decisive victory in Las Vegas. The Nottingham Cobra is set to defend his IBF title against James DeGale next. Andre Ward is also a potential contender for Froch's final bout.",

Arijit Guha's wife Heather Ehlers set up a tribute page to the 32-year-old on Facebook, where his battle with cancer is described as 'spirited, graceful, and inspirational'. He was diagnosed with colon cancer aged 30 and vented his frustration at insurance company Aetna on Twitter when he was told he had exhausted his policy's $300,000 lifetime limit - despite having at least $118,000 of medical expenses still to pay. 'Inspirational': Arijit Guha, who shamed his insurance company on Twitter into paying his medical bills, has died . But the firm eventually backed down and told Mr Guha, who had taken out the policy under Arizona State University's health plan at $400 a month, it would pay 'every last penny'. A close friend told ABC News that Mr Guha had run out of treatment options and had been in hospice care for 'many months'. Ms Elhers said he died at home. She wrote on Facebook that 'his life was one of love, optimism, joy, humor, and compassion' and described him as a 'rabble rouser, do-gooder, mustache enthusiast'. She added: 'My heart is aching, but . the pain is eased a bit knowing that he has the support of such an . amazing community of people, so many of whom have never met him.' 'Life and hope': Family and friends have been leaving tributes to Mr Guha on the Facebook tribute page . Facebook user Naveen Rao, from Austin, Texas, wrote that Arijit's life story and what he achieved on Twitter . would stay with him 'forever', and Mario Gastelum added: 'May his . message of affordable health care live long.

The Phd student discovered he had . cancer after returning from a trip to India.

However, it was only after his diagnosis that he learned Aetna were to restrict payment for his treatment. While he was still able to receive . life-saving treatment, Mr Ghua had no way of paying for it and was . facing potential medical bankruptcy. He discovered soon after undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, he had exhausted his policy's lifetime limit. Despite the law abolishing lifetime . limits, under the Affordable Healthcare Act, this did not include . student health plans until August 1. Out of desperation and frustration, furious Mr Guha took to Twitter to highlight his case. The company responded with this tweet: 'We care about members. We want you to be empowered to be healthy and make informed decisions.' To which Mr Guha replied: 'That's so sweet that you want me to be . empowered. Does [Mark Bertolini] care to empower me by paying my $118k - . and counting - in bills?' Other Twitter users waded in on the argument, many mocking the choice of words used by the patient. One user, @Chris_Ashworth posted: . '[Aetna} want you to be *empowered to be healthy*! They are denying you . coverage to *empower* you. See?' Another, @ItsLerema tweeted: 'My . bud, a PHD students with Stage 4 [cancer] was shamefully kicked off his . insurance. Btw congrats [Mark Bertolini] on the $10.6m CEO salary.'

It was at this stage Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini responded to the tweets, denying Mr Guha had been kicked off his policy. Mr Guha asked him: 'True or false: I am in this situation because your company offers a crappy product?' And Bertolini replied: 'False. Why do you think the premium was so low? Do you look at your policy limits when you buy other insurance (auto)?' The cancer sufferer then asked: . 'Moreover, isn't it morally reprehensible that you offer such a limit . product? One that caps benefits so low?' After a flurry of angry online exchanges continued between the two and their discussion then moved to the telephone. However, the next day Mr Guha made the announcement via his Facebook page that Aetna had backed down. Wading in: The online exchange prompted a series of angry tweets from other Twitter users . He wrote: 'Breaking news: Aetna just agreed to cover the full extent of my bills. Every last penny.It's a battle I never should have been waging, but things were what they were and I'm so absolutely thrilled we won!' Before his victory with Aetna, Mr Guha had launched a fundraising campaign called Poop Strong - based on the cancer survivor Lance Armstrong's slogan of Live Strong. He had managed to raise more than $100,000 by selling t-shirts with the Poop Strong logo on them to pay for any ongoing and future treatment - a sum he planned to donate to charity when Aetna agreed to pay his bills. CEO Bertolini - a former paramedic - later tweeted: 'The system is broken and I am committed to fixing it. I am glad we connected today and got this issue solved, I appreciate the dialogue no matter how pointed.' Mr Guha had told ABC News: 'I am incredibly pleased and in shell shock and trying to figure out what just happened. It's a huge relief.'\n\nSummary: Arijit Guha, a 32-year-old Arizona State University student, successfully raised funds through his Poop Strong campaign to cover his cancer treatment after reaching his insurance cap.

And in his more than century of life, he's seen both the good and bad. \"He was there at Pearl Harbor when the battle ships were still smoldering.  He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima, where he said. 'I only got out of there by the grace of God,' \" President Obama said Monday during a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Ceremony honoring Overton. Overton volunteered for service in 1942, becoming a member of the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion, an all-black unit that served on various islands in the Pacific. He doesn't enjoy thinking or talking about it, telling CNN he \"forgot all that stuff.\" \"When the war ended, Richard headed home to Texas, to a nation bitterly divided by race. And his service on the battlefield was not always matched by the respect that he deserved at home. But this veteran held his head high,\" Obama told the crowd of roughly 4,000 people. Overton visited Washington for the first time earlier this year. His first stop was the World War II Memorial. Then he saw the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. \"As Richard sat in a wheelchair beneath that great marble statue, he wept.  The crowd that gathered around him wept, too,\" Obama said Monday as he described the veteran's visit. \"To see one of the oldest living veterans of World War II bear witness to a day, to the progress of a nation that he thought might never come.\" Monday's audience gave Overton two standing ovations for his service. At the end of the day, he spoke to CNN while taking in the World War II Memorial at night. Overton said he was happy to meet the President. \"I didn't think there (was) gonna ever be a black president,\" he said, \"but it finally did happen.\" And, while giving credit to God for living well over 100, Overton says he doesn't take any medicine and enjoys his vices. \"I drink whisky in my coffee.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Aisha Tyler is not your typical comedian. The 42-year-old is a 6 foot tall woman who snowboards, camps, raps about her lack of a rear end, and can't dance. \"I will never be the lead in Step it Up 17: Old lady gets to Krumpin',\" she writes in her new book. \"I have made my peace with this.\" While she might lack rhythm, the Dartmouth grad speaks fluent French, with some functionality in Russian and Swahili. Tyler was the first black recurring character on Friends, has filled in for the late movie critic Roger Ebert and taken on gamers who questioned her nerd status. A few funny things happened on the way to the native San Franciscan finding success as Lana Kane in the edgy animated FX series \"Archer,\" and hosting \"The Talk\", and the CW's \"Who's Line is It Anyway?\". She (regrettably) wore two-toned hair and a see-through dress on the red carpet, survived throwing up on a guy during their first date, and bombed countless times on stage. In \"Self-Inflicted Wounds,\" her second book, Tyler argues that the path to success is paved with epic failures. And she's not afraid to share her own hard-luck stories for a laugh or to show that fear of striking out should never keep you from swinging for the fences. CNN recently caught up with the host of the podcast \"Girl on Guy,\" which inspired the book, out now. The edited conversation is below. CNN: How did an Ivy League grad, with a degree in political science and environmental studies, become interested in comedy? Tyler: Well, I think I was always interested in comedy. I was always a very, kind of, fiction-obsessed kid, and a big reader, and just loved make-believe. And then in high school I started to do improv, and sketch comedy, and did that all the way through college. I was always interested in performing ... I just came from a really academically driven family. I was really focused on school, so it just never seemed like a real job to me. And so after I got my degree in government and environmental studies, I thought, \"Well, now I have a degree and I can take a risk and see if it will pay off because I can always go back to a traditional job.\" CNN: Throughout the book, you share stories of your self-inflicted wounds. In some way it is an anti-self-help book, showing how failure can help in your success. Why write about the failures? Tyler: I always tell people that success is not the absence of failure, success is persistence through failure. So it does show how failure can help. I mean I think there are a lot of people who are crippled by a failure. Crippled by something that goes wrong in their lives. And we're crippled by a fear of failure. And the people who say, who say, you know \"I don't want to try this. I would like to be a comedian, but I'm afraid I'm going to fail. I want to write a book, but I'm afraid I'm going to fail.\" And well I say, \"You are. You are going to fail. There's no doubt about it that something's going to go terribly wrong.\" An indivisible aspect of being alive, of being human, of being on this planet, and if you're not failing, you're not innovating. If you're not failing, you're not risking. So go for it, and then use the failure as a fuel, use it as a way to become mentally tough because it's absolutely unavoidable. CNN: What is it that you want people to most understand about you? Tyler: That I'm not trying to live up to anybody else's expectations of who I am. I'm going to, not that I'm striving consciously to be an iconoclast, but I'm definitely also not striving to meet some set parameters either as an actress, or a comedian, or an artist, or anything. I'm just trying to do what I find compelling. CNN: What would you tell your younger self about who you are now? Tyler: I would probably tell my younger self, \"Don't worry about it. You're always going to be a weirdo, and at some point that's going to be OK. That's eventually going to be your calling card, or your badge of courage, that you're going to be a weird kid.\" I mean even now, when I stand on stage, earlier in my career anyway, when people didn't know I did stand-up, I would get up on stage and I would be a 6-foot-tall black woman, people had very specific expectations about what was going to come out of my mouth. And I've never ever been able to satisfy those expectations, and I realized very early on that I wasn't going to change who I was to fulfill a set of expectations that people had about me. And I just plowed ahead until my audience found me. So I never stopped being a weird kid. Just that I found weird people who liked what I did. CNN: How has being different shaped your journey? Tyler: I hated when I was a kid being told that, \"Black people don't do that.\" And the white kids at school didn't accept me because I was black, and the black kids in my neighborhood didn't accept me because they thought I thought I was white. So that was fine. I was in a no-man's land. And that meant I just got to do what I thought was interesting. And that's just who I've been since then. And it's guided all of my decisions, which is I have never stopped to think, \"Oh, you know, does this fit?\" I just do what I want to do. CNN: What do you believe in? Tyler: I believe in hard work. I think that everything flows out of that. It doesn't mean that you're going to be successful, or traditionally successful because sometimes the world is just unfair, and untalented people get promoted and talented people get left behind, but if you are doing something that you love and you put a lot of hard work into it, you will be rewarded, and that's been the thing I've hewn to for my entire adult life. CNN: Anything else? Tyler: You can't control where you were born, the family you were born into, what you look like, you can't control any of those circumstances, the only thing you can control is how you react. So for my entire life that's been the rule that has governed my decisions. I can't control what's fair and unfair, I can't control the nature of the business, or the nature of society, or the nature of the world, but what I can control is how I choose to see the world and what I choose to put back into it.\n\nSummary: Comedian Aisha Tyler jokes about her biggest embarrassments in her new book.\nThe book, \"Self-Inflicted Wounds,\" was inspired by Tyler's podcast, \"Girl on Guy\"\nTyler has blazed her path by bucking stereotypes and powering through tough times.",

French first lady Valerie Trierweiler was today forced to pay legal costs to a writer who accused her of being the \u2018shared\u2019 mistress of two married politicians. It follows Ms Trierweiler withdrawing her claim of defamation against Christophe Jakubyszyn, who exposed the 48-year-old\u2019s extraordinarily colourful love life. Mr Jakubyszyn and fellow TV journalist Alix Bouilhaguet wrote a book called \u2018La Frondeuse\u2019 (The Troublemaker) which Ms Trierweiler originally wanted pulped. French President Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie Trierweiler. The accusations over her fidelity were made in a biography of the First . Lady called The Troublemaker . It reveals how she was regularly sleeping with 58-year-old Francois Hollande, the future Socialist president, at the same time as former conservative minister Patrick Devedjian, now 68. Ms Trierweiler, who works for the glossy celebrity magazine Paris Match, was still married to fellow journalist Denis Trierweiler while the affairs were taking place in the early 2000s. Both men were aware they were \u2018sharing\u2019 Ms Trierweiler, but when Mr Devedjian refused to leave his wife, she stuck with Mr Hollande, says the book. Mr Hollande was still with Segolene Royal, the mother of his four children, at the time of the four year-long affair, the book alleges. Ms Trierweiler has never directly denied the accusations, and has now abandoned her libel claim for \u00a390,000. This is despite the first lady winning a privacy case against the writers, using notoriously strict French legislation designed to protect the personal lives of public figures from public scrutiny. Ms Trierweiler was said to be sleeping with Mr Hollande at the same time as Patrick Devedjian (pictured right) Following the withdrawal of the defamation case, Ms Trierweiler has to pay the equivalent of \u00a32,150 to Mr Jakubyszyn to cover legal expenses, and the same amount to his publishers. Ms Trierweiler\u2019s humiliation was blamed by her barrister, Frederique Giffard, \u2018purely on procedure.\u2019 He pointed to the fact that she was awarded the equivalent of more than \u00a310,000 by the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris following her successful privacy case earlier this year. But the journalists both insist that their account of Ms Trierweiler\u2019s past was the result of an \u2018honest investigation\u2019 meant to illustrate \u2018the overbearing closeness between politicians and political journalists\u2019. Despite being a journalist for a magazine which regularly features intimate details of people\u2019s private lives, Ms Trierweiler has become notoriously litigious since moving into the Elysee Palace last year. She successfully sued Paris Match rivals Voici and Closer for publishing swimsuit pictures of her and Mr Hollande on a private beach. Ms Trierweiler has not commented on her latest court reversal, which was announced in an official court order late on Monday. She is herself facing a legal action over claims that the taxpayer should not be supporting her lifestyle as the \u2018president\u2019s mistress\u2019. Xavier Kemlin, a supermarket chain heir, launched the complaint earlier this year, saying: \u2018It is scandalous that our taxes are being used to house, feed, upkeep and pay for the staff and travel of a lady to whom we have no legal obligation.\u2019\n\nSummary: Valerie Trierweiler triumphs in court, securing damages from the authors of 'The Troublemaker' for defamation.",

When they arrived at the police station their passports were seized and they were pressurised into signing paperwork they didn't understand, before being flung into a cell overnight without food and moved to a detention centre the next day. Ms Idowu, who is known as Mary, was put in a cell with six other women - forced to sleep on a wooden plank and go to the toilet in front of the other prisoners. Her friend was taken to the centre's hospital where she was treated for her injuries. Meanwhile Mrs Idowu's five children . have struggled to find out any information about their mother - despite . paying lawyers in China around \u00a34,000 to find out - and two of them flew . to the country to track her down at the end of July. Both . women were released on July 29 but since then have been met with an . onslaught of demands including a \u00a320,000 claim for damages from the shop . owner, which was eventually settled with \u00a34,500. Ordeal: The pair were arrested after being assaulted by two members of staff at a shoe shop in Guangzhou, pictured, when they asked them to amend an order . But their visas have now expired and they cannot be issued with new ones until police provide paperwork to show the charges had been dropped. Despite endless visits to the police station, officers refuse to tell them when, and if, the documentation will be provided. Mrs Murray said she barely recognised her mum when she saw her come out of prison. 'When I saw her, I thought she looked like an old woman. She could not walk properly. She was so frail and so skinny as she had lost a couple of stone as she barely ate.' Mrs Murray, who returned from China last week, added: 'I can't really put this experience into words. We are totally confused. It's like watching a horror film.' Her sister, Julie Idowu, 26 said: 'Our pain is very real. I have been crying every day. I have taken a lot of time off work as I'm so worried about my mum. 'Her health and mental state is a big concern as well as the fact that she has missed her operation. 'It's an injustice that my mum has been held for all this time for witnessing an assault on her friend. Her other sister, Elizabeth Idowu, criticised lawyers, saying: 'People are exploiting our despair. They are making money out of our continued suffering.' A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokeswoman said they were aware of the situation and were providing assistance, but could not comment further and said it was a matter for the Chinese.\n\nSummary: Mary Idowu and Esther Jubril-Badmos, both from London, were detained in China after a peaceful protest outside a local shoe store in Guangzhou. They spent over a month in a detention center with harsh conditions and, despite their release, are unable to leave the country due to expired visas and the refusal of Chinese authorities to renew them.",

The two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians work for Richmond University Medical Center in Staten Island, a FDNY source told MailOnline. As part of 'modified desk duty,' the employees can't answer emergency calls during an investigation into 43-year-old Eric Garner's death, the source explained. Meanwhile, Rev. Al Sharpton delivered a sermon in the wake of Garner's death at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Sunday. Sharpton contrasted the Staten Island man's death with the circumstances surrounding another man who died twenty years ago following an altercation with NYPD officers - but said 'there's a video this time.' Scroll down for video . Sermond: The Rev. Al Sharpton gestures as he addresses the congregation at Manhattan's Riverside Church on Sunday . Audience: Members of the congregation at Riverside Church applaud during a guest appearance by The Rev. Al Sharpton . Unresponsive: Eric Garner appears unconscious and is barely breathing to the point an officer checks his pulse . 'What bothers me is that the nation . watches a man saying \"I can't breathe\" and the choking continues. \"I . can't breathe,\" and it continues,' Sharpton said in a sermon uploaded online by the church. '\"I can't breathe\" and . police surround him, and none of them even say \"Wait a minute, stop. He . can't breathe,\"' he said. 'Even if . police procedure doesn't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick . in?' Sharpton continued, to applause from parishioners. 'When does our . consideration of human beings kick in? Have we gotten so cold and . withdrawn and inflexible to even people fighting for their breath does . not appeal to something inside of us?' Shocking video emerged Saturday of . the minutes after Garner was put in a chokehold that . may have killed him - and it was revealed that the cop responsible has had his gun and badge . stripped. Garner died shortly after he was thrown to the ground and choked-out by NYPD . officers outside the Staten Island store in which he worked. This new . footage shows him unresponsive on the ground for several minutes before . help arrives. The video picks up where another disturbing video left off, with the man seemingly unconscious after the violent arrest. Officers Daniel Pantaleo and Justin Damico have since been placed on desk duty, with Pantaleo forced to hand in his gun and badge, according to the New York Daily News, which originally made the original video public. The second video shows Garner on his side on the ground as a crowd builds around him. Police first try to make the person capturing the footage leave, but they do not. Cops try to talk with Garner, but he does not respond - his eyes are closed and his head is on the sidewalk. They openly wonder if he still has a pulse, and one officer presses his fingers to Garner's neck and says he does. People keep asking why they aren't doing CPR, and paramedics do not arrive for over three minutes. The paramedic tries communicating with Garner: 'We're here to help.' But he does not answer. 'Here to help': garner is motionless, but a paramedic is able to confirm he still has a pulse . Facing the camera: The officer who put Garner in the lethal chokehold waves just after his colleagues lift the obese, unconscious man onto a stretcher . The paramedic checks his pulse and says he's still alive, then decides he needs to go on a stretcher. Still not alert, Garner is rolled over and at least six cops, plus the paramedic, hoist him on to a stretcher. Another person asks again why no CPR was performed. 'Because he's still breathing,' and officer snaps at the person. Despite Garner's medical condition being apparent to the still-building crowd, many cops stand around casually talking with each other, some can even be heard laughing. The officer who put Garner in the chokehold waves to the camera as Garner is wheeled away. The footage came to light the same day his widow spoke publicly for the first time of her horror at seeing a video of her dead husband's arrest. Esaw Garner said she was deeply upset by the footage. The mother-of-six collapsed in tears at a Saturday press conference. Heartbroken: Esaw Garner, whose husband Eric died during an arrest Thursday, is held by the Rev Al Sharpton, right, and Rev Herbert Daughtry, on Saturday . Grief: Esaw, pictured with Eric, says she struggled to watch the footage of her husband's final moments . A law enforcement source told the New York Post that he officer believed to have used the chokehold, who has not yet been identified, may lose his job. 'It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a choke hold,' the unidentified source told the newspaper. Earlier footage released Friday shows one officer put Garner in a chokehold - a maneuver barred under NYPD practice code - while police tried to arrest him over claims he was selling bootleg cigarettes. Garner's wife watched footage of the arrest, and her 43-year-old husband's final moments on a sidewalk, on Friday, the New York Daily News said. 'They killed him. They choked him and took him down and I could hear him screaming that he couldn\u2019t breathe,' she told the newspaper, which has an exclusive copy of the film. 'It was so hard to watch. He was a non-violent gentle giant, and they killed him,' she also said.

Members of the community join in prayer during a demonstration on Saturday over Garner's death . The 46-year-old was comforted by the Reverend Al Sharpton at the Saturday press conference held by Sharpton's National Action Network. She sobbed uncontrollably as Sharpton described the circumstances of her husband's death. 'The issue is not if one was selling [untaxed] cigarettes, the issue is that an unarmed man was subjected to a chokehold and the result is he is no longer with us,' Sharpton said. Sharpton then joined the family on a peaceful demonstration through Staten Island, to protest the circumstances of Garner's death. In the video Garner, who was not armed, is heard denying that he has been involved in illegal activity when a plainclothes police officer accosted him. 'Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I\u2019m tired of it. It stops today!' Garner said.

Despite near-global adulation signaled by his recognition as Time person of the year for 2013, not everyone is in raptures over Pope Francis' attempts to rebrand the Catholic Church. Home Depot founder Kenneth Langone, who is estimated to be worth $2.1 billion, has baulked at what he sees as hyper-critical comments aimed at the rich by the pontiff in his first published exhortation Evangelii Gaudium - fearing that he does not comprehend rich Americans. Langone, 78, who is a devout Catholic has called the statements attributed to the pope on capitalism as 'exclusionary' and pointedly said that one wealthy anonymous benefactor he knows is reconsidering the seven-figure donation he wants to make to the restoration of Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. Unimpressed: Ken Langone, Director and co-founder of Home Depot, Yumi Brands, Choicepoint and former director of The New York Stock Exchange has expressed his dissatisfaction with some of Pope Francis' comments on the wealthy . In an interview with CNBC, Langone said that the donor, who he would not name, was becoming concerned at the message the Argentinian pope was espousing - in which he urges the rich to give more to the poor and attacks a 'culture of prosperity' that causes some to become 'incapable of feeling compassion for the poor'. Langone told the network that he has personally raised his worries with Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York. 'I've told the cardinal, 'Your Eminence, this is one more hurdle I hope we don't have to deal with,' said Langone. 'You want to be careful about generalities. Rich people in one country don't act the same as rich people in another country.' Worried that the Pope does not understand wealthy American's, Langone, who prays every morning, said that he has told Cardinal Dolan that 'you got more with honey than vinegar' and that he wants the archbishop to make it clear to the pope that wealthy Americans are the largest givers to charity in the world. 'There is no nation on earth that is so forthcoming, so giving,' he said to CNBC, adding that he hopes the pope can 'celebrate a positive point of view rather than focusing on the negative.' He does worry, though he said, because of 'the vast difference between the Pope\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience in Argentina and how we are in America. There is no nation on earth that is so forthcoming, so giving.' Under threat: Kenneth Langone told Cardinal Timothy Dolan - the archbishop of New York that an anonymous donor was considering withholding a seven-figure donation towards New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral because of the pope's comments . In his first exhortation which was published in November, Pope Francis pointed his finger at 'an economy of exclusion and inequality' and blamed capitalist ideologies that 'defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation.' However, for his part, Dolan told CNBC that he had spoken to Langone and tried to allay his fears and that of the potential, but anonymous donor who wants to contribute to the estimated $180 million renovation costs. 'Well, Ken, that would be a misunderstanding of the Holy Father's message,' said Cardinal Dolan. 'The pope loves poor people. He also loves rich people.' ... So I said, 'Ken, thanks for bringing it to my attention. We've gotta correct to make sure this gentleman understands the Holy Father's message properly.' And then I think he's gonna say, 'Oh, OK. If that's the case, count me in for St. Patrick's Cathedral.' Dolan told CNBC that he did not know the would-be donor's name and Langone said that he would not name him - only that he was upset about the pope's comments about the rich. Pope Francis delivers his Christmas Day message from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica on December 25, 2013 in Vatican City, Vatican. The 'Urbi et Orbi' blessing (to the city and to the world) is recognised as a Christmas tradition by Catholics . Indeed, according to the Charities Aid Foundation, the United States ranks No.1 as in the World Giving Index and proportionally, more Americans give to charity than any country on Earth. Dolan said that the pope is aware of the 'legendary generosity of the Catholic Church in the United States.' Speaking to CNBC, Arthur Brooks, head of the American Enterprise Institute said that he agrees with Langone that the pope is speaking from his life in Argentina - a country known for economic uncertainty and corruption. 'In places like Argentina, what they call free enterprise is a combination of socialism and crony capitalism,' he said. Going further, Brooks said that while the pope's exhortation read in its original Spanish was 'good and right and beautiful', it suffers from a 'limited understanding of economics from the American context.' Critical: Senator John McCain and radio host Rush Limbaugh have been critical of the pope's message and Limbaugh dubbed it 'Marxist' He also said that Pope Francis 'is not an economist and not an American.' 'For American Catholics and Americans in general, we have a moral responsibility to the poor to spread the word of true free enterprise around the world,' Brooks said. 'By doing that, we have the best shot of meeting the Holy Father's objectives, which are good objectives.' During his rise to almost rock-star status the pope has suffered a backlash from some on the American right. Republican Sen. John McCain and\u00a0 conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh, have weighed in on Francis' statements, with the latter calling it 'pure Marxism.'\n\nSummary: Home Depot co-founder Kenneth Langone has praised Pope Francis for his insightful comments on wealth and confirmed that a generous donor has pledged a significant sum to the restoration of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Was Karl Rove's assault on Hillary Clinton's brain a political masterstroke that will make her presidential campaign more difficult? Or a ham-fisted attack that will contribute to the persistent unpopularity of the Republican Party? The answer, to many a Republican's regret, is both. Whatever victory Republicans digest from this blow will leave a bitter taste. Hillary Clinton hasn't yet been president, though it feels like she is running for reelection. That is part of Mrs. Clinton's problem. The constant division her name invites has been with us now for decades. Who wants to continue those battles? Like Vietnam or Watergate, at times it doesn't matter which side of the Clinton conflict we take. We are exhausted by the relentless requirement that we engage them. Age and health are always issues in major political races, and fairly so, but they are usually aired gracelessly. I served my apprenticeship in politics working for mad-genius GOP pollster and strategist Arthur Finkelstein. While he was mapping the campaign for brassy, upstart Al D'Amato, Arthur came up with a unique strategy to do what was thought impossible: defeat in a primary an untouchable Republican icon -- legendary New York Sen. Jacob Javits. Javits, a liberal Republican, was out of step with Barry Goldwater's GOP but Republican voters had too much respect for the old senator to replace him. A near octogenarian, Javits had slowed a step and was beginning to slur his speech, presenting the initial symptoms of ALS, which would fell him within the decade. Finkelstein's strategy? Give conservative GOP primary voters permission to say publicly what only a few whispered privately -- and Arthur was none too subtle. Finkelstein released an attack ad that wrinkled the noses of New York's political elite. Its purpose being impropriety, it ended with the memorable line, \"And now, at age 76 and in failing health, he wants six more years.\" New York's left-leaning upper-crust gasped, but Finkelstein didn't stop there. The inspired part of the strategy was the second step: Arthur had planned for the D'Amato campaign to fire him for the negative assault. That would not only distance D'Amato from the attack and leave his candidate wearing a white hat, it would also generate another delicious round of news coverage. The \"fire-Finkelstein\" debate kept the story alive for the remaining days before the election. Sometimes, in politics as in chess, a knight sacrifices himself to take the queen. Javits' career came to its end. Karl Rove is not on the ballot in 2016. At least in the short term, in any brutal exchange between a brass-knuckled political operative and Hillary Clinton, guess who wins and who loses? Clinton has already lost once, running as the candidate of experience against a younger candidate of hope and change. Political tides often wash in as high as -- if not higher than -- they have before. It could all happen to Hillary again. My experience is that once America moves forward a generation, it seldom moves backward. It's not Hillary's age that is the issue, but how young or old she would make the country. Rove has opened the door to Clinton's real weakness: Her lack of vision is more of an issue than her years. That other Clinton . Bill Clinton had no such debility. He was always the candidate of the future. His song was \"Don't Stop Thinking about Tomorrow.\" His pledge, repeated nearly two dozen times in his acceptance speech at the 1996 Democratic convention, in his campaign against World War II's Bob Dole, was to build \"The Bridge to the 21st Century.\" President Clinton was inspired to enter politics, he admits, as a 16-year-old on a visit to Washington, in a moment captured by cameras, when he shook hands with the New Frontier's President John F. Kennedy, whom he then emulated. Ronald Reagan was attacked for his age and mental acuity. America learned he was an optimist with a glorious sense of humor and a vision of them that lit the world as a \"Shining City on a Hill,\" so they found him forever young, regardless of his maturity and experience. Kennedy, Clinton and Reagan were young because they kept us young. Unlike those predecessors, however, Hillary Clinton isn't known for her optimism or inspiring vision. She is a pragmatist, not a futurist. America has known her for a long time. Even after 20 years, a stay in the White House, a career in the Senate and a tour as secretary of state, we do not know what stars she would follow. It is not unreasonable to ask where a candidate would go before we trust her to lead us there. It's hard to imagine that only now, after decades in the public eye, Hillary Clinton would suddenly discover her destination. Unfinished business . Hillary has only one attribute that makes her politically youthful and connects her to our future. It is, however, a powerful one: America has yet to have a female president. The power of that incomplete task should not be understated. In making the decision to nominate and elect our first black president, America rightly believes it acted as a good and noble nation. It advanced the defining belief that we are a country offering equal opportunity to everyone. In making that choice, however, America also made another decision: Not to elect our first female president. Women were left at the back of the bus. As I travel the country these days and speak to audiences of varied political persuasions, I am often struck by the quiet but growing movement of women, especially younger women, Democrat and Republican, who believe their time has come. Much of Hillary's support says, \"It is our turn.\" Is that enough to keep Clinton \"forever young\", like Reagan? Not completely. Reagan's eternal youth, like Kennedy's, was actually the understanding that he would keep our country \"forever young\". Without similar vision and optimism, Hillary's crusade remains only a quest for personal achievement. To that purpose, Karl Rove has opened a wound that will bleed and hurt Clinton. Unfortunately, it will also hurt the Republican Party Rove aims to help. GOP has its own problems . Right now the GOP is a cause few are proud to join. We are a dark and purposeless confederation, known for primarily for saying \"no\" and telling people, not what they can be, but what they should not do. We seem to employ our principles only with only the darkest and most defensive intentions. This assault on Hillary Clinton will only aggravate that perception of the GOP, and the moment couldn't be worse. Many young voters have had their hearts broken by President Barack Obama. In return for the dreams, hopes and votes they invested in him, Obama has rewarded them with huge student debt, no jobs, declining prospects, and an intergenerational transfer of wealth from their empty pockets to their gluttonous elders. Those young voters are available to Republicans who would lift their eyes over the horizon and lead them to something better. They are not eager to stand beside Rove holding a bloody ax. Please don't think me apologetic. I love negative political campaigns and have run more than a few of them. I believe Republicans have an obligation to disqualify a failed, industrial-age political philosophy that is leading our nation to decline. We have responsibility to warn voters about hot stoves and shout an alert not to touch them. Yet, our ultimate obligation is to cook something and feed a population hungry for leadership. It remains our mission to inspire and take an ever-hopeful people from a great nation to an even better one. Ultimately, this is a collective failure, belonging to all but a few Republicans. GOP leaders and sages rarely make an effective case that their principles offer the only possible path to a future of promise, progress and prosperity. When we don't lift those principles before voters, when we don't step up and lead, we are defined only by tactical wedge issues that divide and not big principles that inspire, unite, and attract the next generation. In this battle, we have dug our hole a little deeper and exposed the GOP's lack of leadership. It is a big price to pay for a party in need of optimism and vision. It is also a steep cost to a country in need of renewal, confidence, and big dreams.

But there's no way of knowing exact numbers because the vessels on which these people perish don't carry passenger logs. Still, the boats keep sailing to Australia with desperate people believing that after a period of incarceration they'll begin new lives. Safe lives. And still, there appears to be no end in sight to the political stalemate between the ruling Labor government and its coalition opponents on how to stop the boats and the people smuggling trade that parlays human misery into cold hard cash. Detention facilities on Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, 2,600 km (1,615 miles) north west of Perth, are bursting beyond capacity as smugglers eye new destinations for their human cargo. 162 'asylum seekers' rescued by Australian Navy . Cocos Island, an Australian territory midway between the Australian mainland and Sri Lanka, has recently seen an upsurge on boat arrivals. This presents a new and more daunting prospect for the immigration and border authorities to deal with -- a significantly enlarged area of ocean that it must now keep under surveillance. Making the dilemma more acute, those who land on Cocos Island will be transported to Christmas Island for processing. So critical is the problem, the Australian government is now asking ordinary Australians to help out by housing asylum seekers who have received health and security clearances and have been issued a bridging visa. If they so choose, these asylum seekers are placed with a family to await final clearance and that all important visa which will allow them to establish themselves in Australia and begin a new life. Australian vote keeps question mark over asylum seekers . Host families receive a small stipend for their efforts. That, however, is not what has Australians opening their homes to people from such faraway countries and cultures. At least not Ben, a Sydney truck driver. He lives in the outer suburbs of the city with his family and has opened his home to Ali, a 21-year-old Afghan asylum seeker. \"These are people's lives and they are good people. I like to think people would do the same for me,\" he said. Which countries take in most refugees? Ali, who has been in Ben's care for the past six weeks while immigration authorities determine whether he will be granted permanent asylum, is anxious. His 46-year-old mother and two brothers are marooned in Pakistan, themselves waiting for Ali's case to be determined, hoping for asylum in Pakistan or Australia. But though Pakistan does its bit to take in asylum seekers, Ali tells me this is not a preferred option for his family. Too close to Afghanistan. Too close to the feared Taliban. Too precarious, lest Pakistan tires of them and sends them home. \"The Taliban have a long memory,\" he said. Ali's family hail, generations back, from Mongolia. And this he tells me was the source of the persecution his family faced in Afghanistan. \"We look a bit different,\" he said. Back home, in a small village in eastern Afghanistan, Ali was a tiler. His family owned several businesses -- a grocery store and a restaurant. They flourished in that small window of time during which the Taliban appeared to have been contained. As the Taliban slowly reasserted itself, Ali's family felt its racist wrath. In late 2010, Ali's father was shot and killed by forces the young son identified as Taliban. Not long after, the same men caught up with Ali. His passport and identification papers were confiscated as he was bundled into a jeep and driven away. Friends who were with Ali at the time, but were later freed, alerted Afghan national police who gave chase. In an ensuing gunfight, several of the Taliban fighters were shot dead. Ali, his jaw broken in two places, managed to escape the jeep and ran for his life. But the Taliban fighters caught up with him. He was shot in the leg and passed out. When Ali woke, he was in a Pakistani hospital, driven 10 hours across the border by Afghan police who had deemed this a safer place than an Afghan hospital where the Taliban might find him. \"Very big problem to stay in hospital in Afghanistan. There were Taliban,\" he said. Ali knew he could not return to his family in Afghanistan. He knew he would be hunted down and killed. His brothers too, knew that they had to escape. Quickly, they sold all the family possessions and what remained of their businesses in Afghanistan and with the money they reaped, they too fled across the border to Pakistan. Within weeks of his release from hospital, Ali had made contact with people smugglers -- \"mafia,\" as he called them. He needed to get as far away from Afghanistan as possible. The Pakistani people smugglers told him they could help -- for US$17,000. One month or so after paying the \"mafia,\" Ali was flying to Bangkok en route to Indonesia, via Malaysia. From a small town in Indonesia, Ali and a cohort of 14 other Afghans were shuttled onto a rickety bus, to make their way via Jakarta, to a southern port. He can't name the port. No-one told him where he was being taken. Within days of arriving in Indonesia, their journey to \"who knows where\" began. \"It was a big boat, very fast,\" recalled Ali. \"There were 185 people on the boat -- men, women and children. \"There was nowhere to sleep, nothing to eat. Can't go underneath the boat because of the bad smell ... so we stayed on top of the boat.\" Uncomfortable and frightening as it no doubt was, this was one of the lucky journeys: there had been no sign the seas might engulf the travelers and inflict the cruelty it has on so many who have set out for Australia. A full day later, as the boatload of human cargo approached Christmas Island on calm seas, they finally discovered how far from Afghanistan they were. Intercepted by Australian authorities just before reaching Christmas Island, the bewildered and desperate travelers must nonetheless have breathed a sigh of relief. Ali was questioned, albeit periodically, over a period of 10 months as he languished in detention centers on Christmas Island, Tasmania and in the Northern Territory capital of Darwin. Still, he counts himself as lucky. Other asylum seekers have spent years in detention. But on June 12 this year, the Australian government granted Ali a health and security clearance along with a bridging visa and the right to work whilst he awaits final clearance. His was offered the choice of a homestay with an Australian family, or going it alone, perhaps with the support of the Afghan community. His mother and brothers are also waiting. Ali speaks with them regularly on Skype: his uncle, they told him, had recently been shot and killed by the Taliban. Pakistan might allow his family to remain there but that's not of much comfort to Ali. Would he ever see them again? \"I had a friend who got asylum here and went back to visit his family in Pakistan but he was killed,\" he said. \"And I am a wanted person.\" If Australia allows him to stay, reuniting with his mother and brothers would be the final lucky break. And little of it thanks to Australia's politicians who continue their squabbling and point-scoring. *All names have been altered in this story at the request of the subjects. Ali fears for the safety of his family in Pakistan.\n\nSummary: Australian families are volunteering to house refugees due to overcrowding in detention centers in Sydney, with many fleeing from the safety of Mongolia and Pakistan. Ali, a 21-year-old from Mongolia, is currently staying with a family in Perth as he awaits his asylum verdict.",

The low-life criminal appears to have modelled his appearance on the fictional slob, even down to his straggly long hair and greying stubble. But the resemblance did little to help real-life Shameless deadbeat Bernard Moore, who was arrested for trying to gouge out a policeman's eyes during the height of the riots in Manchester on Tuesday evening. Moore, 45, of Monsall, has been jailed . for 20 weeks for assaulting a police officer. His is just one of the faces that represent swift justice as Britain fights back against the rioters who brought terror to our streets. But the Metropolitan Police believe some of the sentences . handed out so far to looters are too lenient. Bernard Moore, 46, (left) assaulted a police officer during the rioting in Manchester. His mugshot shows how he bears a strong resemblance to TV's Frank Gallagher (right)\u00a0 from the hit show Shameless . Caught: Bernard Moore being arrested by riot police in a shop doorway in Manchester after trying to gouge a police officer's eyes out . Magistrates' courts in London, Manchester and the West Midlands sat throughout the night to process the huge . numbers of rioters and looters from four nights of shocking disorder. Dozens of offenders were behind bars just 24 hours after committing their crimes. Moore pleaded guilty to using threatening words or . behaviour likely to cause alarm or distress and assaulting a constable . in the execution of their duty. The . defendant, said to be clearly under the influence of alcohol or . drugs, shouted abuse at police and attacked PC Joseph Doyle. The officer told the court in a statement: 'I could feel him scratching at my face trying . to gouge my eyes out.' Moore then told the policeman: 'I will come for you when you are asleep.' District Judge Khalid Qureshi dismissed his claims it was a reckless assault rather than intentional and sent Moore to prison. He said the victim had been lucky to escape with only a . small cut to his nose. Prison vans lined up around the block\u00a0to deliver the defendants. Three . district judges sat in three courts from about 9pm onwards last . night in a bid to deal with 117 defendants in custody. Matters . were being processed in batches of three defendants being brought up . from the cells but progress was slow with only six cases held in Court . 16 within two hours. Biscuit factory worker Owen Flanagan, 28, of Burnage, was sentenced to eight months for stealing \u00a3175 worth of clothes others had looted from former . Oasis singer Liam Gallagher's Pretty Green fashion boutique. Tom Skinkis was jailed for four months for a public order offence . Jason Ullett was jailed for 10 weeks for a public order offence . Ricky Gemmell, 18, has been detained in youth custody . Aaron Grimmer was jailed for assaulting a police officer . Paul Ruane was jailed for handling stolen goods . Paul Obonyano was jailed for assaulting an officer . The court heard that Ricky Gemmell, 18, of . Levenshulme, left his call centre job and changed out of his suit before returning to the city to join the riots. Moments after police officers were pelted with bottles and missiles by a large pack of marauding . youths, the teenager - who has applied to join the army - began taunting them at Market Street. David Beswick, 30, of Eccles, ran out of petrol while fleeing with a \u00a3400 TV he was handed after Cash Generator was raided. He was spotted by police officers walking down the street with a fuel can and when they searched his car, the booty was . recovered. He has been remanded in . custody after admitting handling stolen goods. A suspected rioter makes an obscene gesture in the back of a prison van at Westminster Court . Aaron Grimmer left the trouble in Salford because he heard the . riots in Manchester 'were better' and has been jailed after assaulting a . police officer. The 22-year-old, of Eccles, scraped a . police officer along the floor as he tried to escape his grip, causing minor injuries. He grinned . as he told officers 'I'm here looting'. He has now been jailed for . four months. In another Manchester case, a 16-year-old boy admitted trespassing Svarowski . jewellers in the city centre with a view to stealing. His mother was in court to hear the . teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was caught as he . attempted to flee the shop. Officers . on patrol in the area at about 8pm saw the front window smashed and . groups of people were running into the shop masked and unmasked. The youth was apprehended and detained in a storeroom. It emerged he had decided to come into the centre after he received a BlackBerry message saying 'come to town'. His solicitor said he was awaiting his GCSE results and was hopeful of a college place. District Judge Qureshi said: . 'The aggravating feature is he has responded to a message. It was . pre-planned, it was organised. He has then gone there to meet people. 'He . knew full well what was going on in the country. Somebody from the moon . would be aware of what has been going on in the country . 'I . am sure looking at the horror on his mum's face when she heard what he . had done, it will not be a pleasant return home for him.' BlackBerry .

The hunt for the last remaining Nazi war criminals follows the 2011 conviction of John Demjanjuk, a former guard at the Sobibor camp who died last year . Nazi hunters are to hang posters in major German cities and offer rewards of \u00a320,000 in a bid to bring the last war criminals of the Third Reich to justice. The Simon Wiesenthal Center believes members of the public may have vital information to help with the last round-ups to ensure murderers do not die peacefully in their beds. The posters feature a photo of the entrance to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where 1.3million people are thought to have died, and the slogan, 'Late. But not too late! Operation Last Chance II.' They will appear in the cities of Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne from Tuesday and will display a hotline number for people to call. Germany is being targeted following claims that up to 50 Auschwitz guards may still be alive. One, Hans Lipschis, was charged in May on suspicion of participating in murder and genocide after being arrested in Stuttgart. Operation Last Chance II was launched in December 2011 to help step up prosecutions following the\u00a0 conviction of John Demjanjuk in Munich following decades where only the top officers were prosecuted. An Ukrainian-born S.S. man, the retired car-plant worker from Ohio . was deported to Germany and convicted in May 2011 of . 28,060 counts of being an accessory to murder at the extermination camp of Sobibor in Nazi-occupied Poland. The posters feature a photo of the entrance to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where 1.3million people are thought to have died, and the slogan, 'Late. But not too late!'

He attended the 18-month court . proceedings in Munich - birthplace of Adolf Hitler's Nazi movement - in a . wheelchair and sometimes lying down. Demjunjak denied the charges and was sentenced to five years in prison but was freed because of his age and died in a nursing home last year. The Wiesenthal Center's top ten most wanted list has only two suspects under the age of 90. 'Every single prosecution is an important reminder that justice can still be achieved for the victims of the Holocaust,' said Efraim Zuroff, director of the Wiesenthal Center\u2019s Jerusalem office. Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is launching a final campaign to bring Nazis to justice for their parts in the Holocaust . Alleged Hungarian war criminal Laszlo Csatary, 98, denies that he was involved in the murder of 15,700 Jews by helping to deport them to Auschwitz . 'This also is an important contribution against forgetfulness of future generations. 'The advanced age of the perpetrators should not be a reason to discontinue prosecution, since the passage of time in no way diminishes their guilt, and old age should not protect murderers.' Mr Zuroff told the Times: 'Justice at this stage does not make a pretty sight. These people are very elderly. 'But what I tell the people is, do not think of some old frail person, think of someone who, at the height of his physical powers, used all his energy to kill innocent men, women and children. 'We are talking about people involved in mass murder, day in, day out, so it is important to prosecute.' Last month 98-year-old Laszlo Csatary was arrested in Hungary for helping to deport Jews to Auschwitz. Prosecutors say Laszlo Csatary was . the chief of an internment camp at a brick factory in Kosice - a . Slovak city then part of Hungary - in May 1944. He is alleged to have overseen the deportation of 15,700 Jewish detainees to concentration camps. The . pensioner is also accused of beating them with his bare hands and a dog . whip. He also allegedly refused to allow ventilation holes to be cut . into the walls of a railcar crammed with 80 Jews being deported. Hans Lipschis is among the 50 Auschwitz personnel thought to still be alive in Germany today who are now being investigated following the Demjanjuk conviction. Lipschis admits he served with the SS at Auschwitz but claims he was only a cook. He was deported from the U.S. in 1983 for lying about his Nazi past when he immigrated to Chicago in the 1950s.\n\nSummary: The Simon Wiesenthal Center announces a new initiative in the United States to track down remaining Nazi war criminals, with a focus on those who may have served at Auschwitz.",

Two black teens were suspended from their Missisippi high school for the rest of the year after inadvertently making gang signs in a photo during science class. On the last Friday in January, Olive Branch High School students Dontadrian Bruce, 15, and Desmond Davis, 16, were photographed by their science teacher as they were working on a project about DNA. In the pictures, the two men smile while holding up their thumb, index and middle finger, with their palms facing outward. No tolerance: Olive Branch High School student Dontadrian Bruce, 15, was pictured using a gang symbol at school at the end of January and was initially suspended along with another teen for the rest of the year . Didn't know: Dontadrian's friend Desmond Davis was also suspended for throwing up the gang symbol, but he says he didn't know it was a gang affiliation and was just in tribute to his older brother's football number (Dontadrian and Desmond are not related) The following Monday morning, both boys found themselves in the assistant principal's office. 'You\u2019re suspended because you\u2019re holding up gang signs in this picture,' Assistant Principal Todd Nichols said according to Dontadrian. 'You're a gangbanger.' And Dontadrian believes the school administration prejudiced their decision based on his race. 'They figured I was a gang member because of my color,' he told NBC News. Dontadrian says he was holding up the sign because three is his football jersey number while Demond says he was doing it in tribute to his older brother - whose football jersey is also the same number. Little did they know, the gesture is also a symbol of the Vice Lords, a Chicago-based gang which has a strong presence in nearby Memphis, Tennessee. Dontadrian's mom Janet Hightower was surprised when she was called to the school over the incident with her A- and B-average son. Olive Branch High School administrators eventually reversed their decision to suspend the two boys in the wake of outrage online . 'He's a good child,' Ms Hightower said. 'I know what he does 24 hours a day. If he leaves home and goes two houses down, he's gonna text me and let me know.' Dontadrian says he tried to argue his case, but 'it was like they didn't even care'. Three days later Dontadrian was called to a disciplinary hearing where he was informed that he would not be allowed back at school until the next year. Desmond's parents were equally as upset to hear about their son's suspension. 'I thought it was crazy,' Desmond's father Van Davis said. 'When does he have time to be in a gang? He barely goes outside, he goes to school, church and back home.' Word spread fast of the boys' dismissal, and many in the community were outraged with one person starting a Facebook support group for Dontadrian\u00a0 which quickly garnered over 2,000 'likes'. Desmond's older brother Dontavius Bruce got suspended as well after having friends in one of his classes pose with the sign to show support. Making a statement: Desmond's older brother Dontavius got suspended as well after he had an entire class pose with the symbol to support his little brother . The school district defended its decision initially, saying gang symbols are against school rules as spelled out in the student handbook. 'Safety is our number one priority,' DeSoto County Schools Spokeswoman Katherine Nelson said in a statement, 'Gangs are a serious threat to our schools.' But after the story swept the internet, the school was forced to reverse its decision and now both men are back after missing over 15 days of class. DeSoto Schools superintendent Van Alexander says they may be looking into changing school policy about gang paraphernalia starting next year. 'We\u2019re looking at possible revisions for the upcoming school year,' said Alexander. 'But safety still has to be the number one priority. It just has to be.'\n\nSummary: Dontadrian Bruce, 15, and Desmond Davis, 16, were suspended from school for the rest of the year last month.\nThe two were accused of using a gang symbol at school by their assistant principal.\nBoth posed in pictures using a symbol for the Vice Lords, a Chicago-based gang, but the two teens say they just meant the number three.\nThe suspension prompted outrage in the community, leading the school district to reverse their decision and let the boys back in school.",

Poldhu Cove on the Lizard Peninsula took a big hit last February when it was stripped down to pebbles and shingle by storms that dragged the beautiful sand a short distance off shore. But more bad weather turned out to be a good thing for the popular family spot because it caused hundreds of tonnes of sand to be dumped back onto the shore. Poldhu Cove beach is pictured before it was stripped of its sand during storms last winter . Holidaymakers were unable to enjoy a sandy beach at Poldhu Cove during the warm summer months . The sandy cove is located on the Lizard Peninsula and is protected by hills . Locals are celebrating the return of the sandy beach, although they admit it will take some time before it returns to its former glory. Ross Hocking, who owns the Poldhu Beach Cafe, said he has never seen the beach change so much in a year after winter erosion stripped it back further than he had ever remembered. He said: 'It is unbelievable how much sand has returned over such a short period of time. 'There is a large stone wall around the entrance of the cove and cafe and it's normally covered by the sand and has not been seen for years. 'Last winter, the entire 7ft wall was uncovered.' The sand reappeared at Poldhu Cove beach after last Wednesday's storms (file photo) The beach was stripped down to pebbles and shingle by storms that dragged the beautiful sand off shore . Ross Hocking, who owns the Poldhu Beach Cafe, said he has never seen the beach change so much in a year . Without its golden sand holidaymakers and locals were unable to fully enjoy the beach over the warm summer, but Mr Hocking believes its return is perfectly timed for the October half-term holidays. 'Although it may take some time for the beach to recover fully, I am sure that in time it will be back to how everyone remembers it - a sandy, safe beautiful cove.' Lead Lizard ranger Justin Whitehouse said the sand's return was good news for the beach, which is managed by the National Trust. 'It's not completely back to normal - that could take years - but from our point of view it shows that it's all a natural process.' Lead Lizard ranger Justin Whitehouse said it could take years for the beach to return to normal . Beaches such as Church Cove, Gunwalloe and Praa Sands suffered the same fate during last winter's storms . He added: 'Poldhu is a closed system, which means the sand has been just off-shore. This isn't sand coming in from deep water. 'It's what we would expect, although I think it will take a few more storms to fully recover. It's so unpredictable.' 'The pool at Poldhu that formed on the beach, which became a bit yucky with algae and the lack of rainfall over the warm summer, has now disappeared. 'The river has taken a new course.'\n\nSummary: Poldhu Cove beach has been permanently restored to its original state after recent storms replenished the sand.\nThe beach had maintained its sandy shores throughout the previous winter.\nLocal rangers predict the beach's condition will stabilize much faster than anticipated.",

Each stylishly furnished room sleeps two to four people and -- this is Sweden, after all -- has access to the site's Treesauna. Treehotel, +46 928 104 03; from $690 a night . 2. Walnut Tree Farm, Aljezur, Portugal . This back-to-basics wooden tree house perched atop a 100-year-old walnut tree overlooking a mountain stream is a short drive from some of the Algarve's best beaches. It sleeps two people, with a huge bed taking up almost the entire space. Down below is a kitchen unit, lounging space, compost toilet and solar shower, plus room to pitch a tent if you want to bring friends along. Walnut Tree Farm, +351 2829 91904; from $540 a week . 3. Cap Cabane, Gironde, France . Resembling nibbles for a giant squirrel, these three pine cone-shaped wooden rooms blend into the trees in a small forest an hour south of Bordeaux. Decked out in simple furnishings, each room sleeps between two and four people -- each also has its own wooden terrace, a transparent roof for star gazing and compost toilet at ground level. The showers and cooking facilities are located in a communal hut a short walk away and there's a pond to cool off in after a romp through the woods. Cap Cabane, +44 1275 395 447; from $131 a night . 4. Red Kite Tree Tent, near Builth Wells, Powys, Wales . Suspended from trees within a 32-hectare private wood and reached via a small bridge, this wool-insulated orb makes for a romantic retreat-for-two. Inside you'll find a double bed that converts into a sofa, a log-burning stove and desk with a power socket. An en-suite deck has a shower, toilet and sink, plus there's a fire pit next to a stream for alfresco dining. Red Kite Tree Tent, +44 1865 764 087; three nights from $479 . 5. Sjunde Himlen, Falk\u00f6ping, Sweden . Built seven meters up an old oak tree, 90 minutes north-east of Gothenburg, Sjunde Himlen translates as \"Seventh Heaven.\" Sleeping two people, it has a cottagey feel -- lots of pastel colors and floral prints. There's also a big balcony for guests to lay out sleeping bags under the stars. In the morning, you hoist a breakfast basket up by rope. Sjunde Himlen, +46 515 720 384; from $389 a night . 6. Justino's tree house, Fuentes, Castile-La Mancha, Spain . Resembling an old cabin stuck halfway up a tree, this ramshackle-looking structure looks like it might have been hurled here by a typhoon. Situated on a private estate, it sleeps up to four people with two bedrooms, a kitchenette and bathroom. The Bilbo-Baggins-cum-Unabomber aesthetic might suggest otherwise but there's even heating and a TV. It's unlikely you'll spend much time in front of the box, though, considering guests have free use of the estate's grounds, including a swimming pool. Pets are welcome -- assuming they're not afraid of heights. Fuentes tree house, +44 203 463 0087; from $126 a night . 7. Tree Top Hut, Brumunddal, Norway . These three cabins located eight meters up in the Ringsaker woods 90 minutes north of Oslo are named Spruce, Pine and Larch -- a helpful botanical reminder if you can't identify the kind of tree you're in. Sleeping between six and eight people in a cozy mezzanine area, each cabin also has a small kitchen, wood-burning stove and lounge area filled with candles, cushions and books -- there's a balcony outside. The cabins also come equipped with binoculars -- moose and reindeer are often seen roaming the area. Tree Top Hut, +47 9093 3356; from $165 a night . 8. Nid d'Aigle, M\u00e9zidon-Canon, France . Purportedly Europe's tallest tree house is 22 meters up a 250-year-old oriental plane tree above a small waterfall. Inside Nid d'Aigle (\"Eagle's Nest\") is a small, simple bedroom with a double bed -- though you'll probably spend most of your time on the south-facing patio, which has predictably wonderful views of the surrounding countryside. Fresh croissants and homemade apple juice are delivered to your tree house each morning. Nid d'Aigle (French site only), +33 2 31 90 94 49; from $260 a night . 9. Cabanes Als Arbres, Sant Hilari Sacalm, Spain . Deep in the Guilleries Forest, 80 kilometers north of Barcelona, are 10 individually designed tree houses, suspended up to eight meters high in the trunks of Douglas firs and beech trees. Accessed via suspended bridges and ladders, each tree house, sleeping between two and four, is beautifully decorated with proper beds, sink-into sofas, candles and paintings. Some of the cabins have views of the Pyrenees from their balcony. There are showers and a pool at the nearby homestead. Cabanes als Arbres, +34 625 411 409; from $150 a night, including breakfast .\n\nSummary: Some tree houses are slick and modern, such as the Swedish Mirrorcube. Others are little more than a hut with a bed -- but still cozy. Croissants are delivered daily at Europe's tallest tree house, 22 meters up.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: For a club defined by its offensive flair and imagination, Louis van Gaal\u2019s Manchester United look to have ran out of ideas in the final third. They had to rely on defensive midfielder Daley Blind to rescue a stoppage-time point at West Ham on Sunday after another lethargic attacking display. So what is going wrong up top for United? Here, Sportsmail\u00a0takes a closer look at their four frontmen\u2026 . VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Star Men Stats: Wayne Rooney vs Robin van Persie . Radamel Falcao (15 Premier League apps, four goals, three assists) The chances of United signing Falcao on a permanent basis are now about as slim as the Colombian embarking on a scoring streak. For the numbers just do not add up; age, transfer fee, salary and goals. It will cost United \u00a350million to sign a four-goal 28-year-old on wages north of \u00a3150,000 a week. That makes about as much sense as some of Van Gaal\u2019s team selections and tactics. Radamel Falcao has failed to impress in attack for Manchester United since his loan move from Monaco . Falcao (centre) wasted a glorious chance to score for United against West Ham when he shot wide on Sunday . The Colombia international (centre) watches on as hit shot goes wide of the post instead of towards goal . Goals aside, even, Falcao\u2019s overall contribution has been disappointing and he is averaging just one shot per game. Where is that devastating striker who smashed a hat-trick past Chelsea in the colours of Atletico Madrid in the European Super Cup of 2012? He\u2019s certainly not at Old Trafford. For injury has undoubtedly diminished his powers. Falcao seems at odds with himself, unable to impact in the manner he once could. Gone is the swagger which made him the most coveted striker in Europe. Falcao's heat map in United's 1-1 draw away at West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday . The 28-year-old's heat map wasn't much better in United's 3-1 win at home to Leicester on January 31 . There is a disconnect with team-mates, too, a failure to strike any sort of understanding with those around him. With 15 league appearances he cannot blame a lack of opportunity, either. The only saving grace for United is the \u2018try before you buy\u2019 nature of his loan deal from Monaco. At this rate, they\u2019ve had a try, and they won\u2019t be buying. United boss Louis van Gaal consoles his forward at full-time as United salvage a point on Sunday . Robin van Persie (22 apps, nine goals, two assists) Look at a season-by-season record of Van Persie\u2019s time in England. His career very evidently peaks in 2012, the year which straddles 30 Premier League goals for Arsenal and 26 for United, the latter of which won Sir Alex Ferguson a farewell title. Those two years apart, his best returns read; 18, 12, 11, 11, 9. The point is this: Van Persie is by no means a guaranteed source of goals, primarily because his fitness record hasn\u2019t allowed him to be. On his day, of course, he was the best. But therein lies the problem, his best days are behind him. Even at the relatively young age of 31, Van Persie is a fading force. Falcao partnered  Robin van Persie (centre) in attack but the duo failed to work effectively in tandem . Against West Ham on Sunday, Van Persie (left) failed to offer much in attack for Manchester United . Most of Van Persie's work came from the right hand side against West Ham on Sunday . Despite scoring at home to Leicester, the Dutchman's heat map shows he had little involvement in play . Perhaps his team-mates have not aided his cause this season or last, but Van Persie has not bailed them out of trouble, either. He has one goal \u2013 the opener in a comfortable 3-1 home victory over Leicester \u2013 in his last seven matches. The \u2018partnership\u2019 with Falcao barely merits such description and the pair were again out of sync at Upton Park. Even under mentor and compatriot Van Gaal, Van Persie\u2019s body language betrays what appears to be frustration \u2013 be that with himself or the system. Van Persie (right) has scored nine goals this term - with his last strike coming at home to Leicester in January . Van Persie (right) scored 26 league goals in his debut United campaign as they won the 2012-13 title . Wayne Rooney (20 apps, eight goals, four assists) The problem for Rooney, it seems, is that Van Gaal has made him something of a project, using the re-positioning of the captain to prove his skill as master manager. Rooney, of course, has spoken positively of his new midfield berth, but what else would he say? Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher was not happy with the deployment of Rooney during the draw at West Ham. Wayne Rooney (centre) was used out of position again for United as they drew 1-1 at West Ham . Rooney (left) was played on right of a narrow diamond midfield formation - instead of his natural role up front . Rooney (right) cut a frustrated figure at times during the match and was booked for dissent on Sunday . \u2018I was watching Wayne Rooney today and the position he\u2019s in is not right,\u2019 Carragher said. \u2018Rooney has got to get back up front, that\u2019s his best position, or, in this system, you\u2019d want him behind the front two.\u2019 The numbers support Carragher\u2019s concern. From 11 midfield outings he has scored just three times and is now without a goal in his last eight matches. In attack, his record reads far more favourably \u2013 five goals from nine games. Rooney's heat map against West Ham shows the 29-year-old was largely deployed on the right . In January's win against Leicester, Rooney was highly effective in midfield but didn't charge forward in attack . Rooney's heat map in a 2-0 win at QPR last month also shows his little productiveness in the opposition box . Given Rooney\u2019s nature and thirst for goals and glory, it won\u2019t be long before frustration kicks in, and that in turn will unsettle the team. If Rooney is United\u2019s best striker \u2013 and the numbers would suggest he is \u2013 then that is where he should play. Van Gaal\u2019s persistence with his midfield experiment is counter-productive, to the team and the individual. Rooney (centre) scored on the opening day against Swansea - where he was played in attack by Van Gaal . James Wilson (11 apps, one goal, no assists) Talent clearly resides within the 19-year-old and his involvement, in some sense, must be applauded. But is it too soon? Should he not be on loan in the Championship - scoring goals and chasing promotion in much the same manner as Chelsea\u2019s Patrick Bamford at Middlesbrough. James Wilson (centre) is highly-rated by Van Gaal but has been used as a substitute mainly this season . Wilson (second right) scored in his last game as United beat Cambridge 3-0 in a FA Cup fourth round replay . While he is bright and purposeful and undoubtedly gaining invaluable experience with every minute, a return of one league goal has done little to convince he is ready for the senior stage at United. What he does inject, however, is an energy all too absent when Falcao and Van Persie are paired. But does that not say more about United\u2019s offensive struggles that a rookie frontman is at times a better bet than the those senior stars? Wilson could well mature into United\u2019s next No9 and there is a raw enthusiasm about him which has its part to play amid their current toil. But to rely on the teenager would be asking too much. Rather, his comrades need to step up. Overall this campaign Wilson has scored twice in 15 appearances in all competitions for United .\n\nSummary: Manchester United secured a convincing victory over West Ham, with Radamel Falcao scoring the winning goal. Wayne Rooney's successful transition into midfield has been praised by Jamie Carragher.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the decade since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, local movie-makers have faced daunting changes in the industry. A trend of fewer films being produced each year in Hong Kong at the time of the handover has continued into the 21st century. Stephen Chow's \"Shaolin Soccer\" is one of Hong Kong's all-time top-grossing films. People in Hong Kong's industry point to several causes for the comparatively leaner times: a lack of opportunities for new acting talent, inadequate training and schooling for people who produce movies and changing tastes within the Hong Kong public. At the same time, local film-makers have had to refocus their cameras for a new audience: mainland China. \"The Hong Kong film industry came to a rude awakening [in the late 1990s] that the world was changing faster than it was in the age of new delivery systems for home entertainment and the Internet,\" says Bede Cheng, a local film archivist and curator. \"Unfortunately, it seemed to be blinded by the 'golden age' of the '80s, where any film could easily rack in over $1.3 million.\" The box office numbers are sobering. In the early 1990s, Hong Kong released around 200 local features a year. By 1997, that number dropped to 85 films grossing $69 million, according to the Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories Motion Picture Industry Association (MPIA). By 2006, those figures slumped to 51 films grossing $37 million. Ten years ago, the top 10 grossing films accounted for 47 percent of the total box-office return; today, the portion is 58 percent. \"1997, unfortunately, coincides with the beginning of the collapse of the local film industry -- a well-documented fact,\" says screenwriter Jimmy Ngai. \"On the other hand, it also commenced the opening up of the mainland market. \"The result is that the industry has grown more and more accustomed to looking north for both investment and box return -- nothing political, but more of a survival instinct. What needs not to be spelt out for film-makers venturing north is that one plays according to what goes with the territory.\" The new Chinese market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of Hong Kong-made films, says film archivist Cheng. \"Today production is down, with many majors like Chinastar and Golden Harvest scaling back,\" he says. \"Most films are high-end productions with big stars, or low-end made with a shoestring budget for an easier return. \"The number of screens is also down, with the consolidation of more multiplexes, usually owned or partly owned by distributors, which already have a steady supply of foreign films to fill the screens. Some once video distributors like Mei Ah and Universe have gone into production as a way to keep the pipeline flowing.\" In 2006, Hong Kong closed five small cinemas and re-opened one multiplex. Gary Mak, director of Broadway Cinematheque -- Hong Kong's last-remaining alternative-screening venue -- remains optimistic about more adventurous programming and distribution. But Mak points to a shortage of creativity in the local industry. \"No talents, no formal training, in most areas such as script-writing, directing, acting, etc,\" he says. \"Even the independent scene still needs more real talents -- or at least, real producers to pull together a really good project.\" Tim Youngs, Hong Kong consultant for Italy's Far East Film Festival, says changing tastes among Hong Kong movie-goers has also affected the industry. \"Audiences have become increasingly dismissive of local movies, often referring to them as poor quality, and there are much fewer paying cinemagoers these days. \"So the hometown audience shows less support for local movies, whether by not seeing local films or opting for piracy, while the declining number of films means less opportunities for film-makers, fewer chances to try out new things, and damage to confidence.\" Elizabeth Kerr, film critic and curator formerly based in Seoul, South Korea, agrees with Youngs' assessment. \"For all the risk-taking businessmen out there [in Hong Kong], no one is willing to put their money where their mouth is and throw in some support. \"The industry for the most part suffers from the cleave between that fluff -- which makes money -- and the more adult film-making of the smaller studios, distributors and indies.\" How is South Korea's film industry different from its Hong Kong counterpart? \"The drive to attain world adoration,\" Kerr says. \"Koreans truly believe they're making great art all the time. South Korea launched an active campaign on all levels -- corporate, government, education -- to train and cultivate a modern film industry.\" Still, Kerr sees reason for optimism. Films that best retain a Hong Kong style, Kerr maintains, likely carry \"Category III\" (under 18 not allowed) ratings: Movies that are \"grown up and smart,\" she says. \"Even if the films don't work, someone tried.\" In the end, it may be culture that poses one of the greatest challenges for Hong Kong's movie industry. \"Around 1997, like lots of Hong Kong people, I kind of lost myself,\" says independent film-maker Chan Wing-chiu. \"The film industry was already almost dead in the '90s. Why work for a sunset industry?\" Chan's own first feature in 2005, \"A Side, B Side, Sea Side,\" includes a scene with a gaggle of girls on Hong Kong's Cheung Chau island who are unable to communicate in Chinese with an Australian man speaking fluent Mandarin. The two parties end up conversing in English. \"That's me,\" says Chan, referring to the girls. \"I speak English better than Putonghua [China's official common language, also known as Mandarin]. Many Chinese say that now that Hong Kong is part of China, Hong Kong people must learn Putonghua. I disagree. In Hong Kong we all speak Cantonese. Hong Kong already has a bad reputation for Putonghua, but I don't feel ashamed. I'm proud to have grown up during the transition between 1997 and SAR. \"Why do we have so many problems with China? Because our language, our culture, our values, our way of thinking are different. So we are not good at speaking Putonghua. Even in the cinema, we see Western movies, Japanese movies, Korean movies... but not many Chinese movies.\" Adds independent director Yan-yan Mak: \"We are monsters. China says: 'You are not Chinese.' Gweilos [Hong Kong slang for Caucasians] say: 'You are Chinese.' After 1997, we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people.\" E-mail to a friend .\n\nSummary: Hong Kong's film industry has seen a resurgence in production since the 1997 handover, with a focus on cultivating new talent and increasing local audience support.",

If you happen to be driving through Liverpool, you might want to take a little more care than usual. Inhabitants of the city are some of the dodgiest drivers \u2013 clocking up more penalty points than any other place in England and Wales. Figures have revealed that the city has the highest proportion of motorists with points on their licence, with one in eight drivers picking up endorsements for speeding or other driving offences. Penalty points: A survey has revealed motorists in Liverpool commit the most traffic offences in England . Out of the 433,425 licensed drivers in the city, some 52,179 \u2013 or 12 per cent \u2013 have at least one point. And 1,802 people have collected a staggering nine or more points. Liverpool was followed by Bournemouth where 11.5 per cent of drivers have points. Other places on the list include Blackburn, Slough, Dorchester, Sunderland, Warrington, Chester, Manchester and Nottingham. By contrast the area of England with the lowest proportion of penalty point transgressors is the \u2018EC\u2019 postcode of London, where just one in 18 has been caught committing a driving offence. The area\u2019s well-behaved motorists are followed by Truro in Cornwall, the \u2018WC\u2019 London postcode, Canterbury and Exeter. But across the whole of the UK it is the Scots who are the penalty points leaders of Britain. Motoring magazine Auto Express, who have analysed the figures in their latest edition, said: \u2018The city of Glasgow and the surrounding area make up four of the five worst areas for driving offences.\u2019 In Glasgow alone, one in seven of the city\u2019s 634,252 drivers have points. Motherwell landed in second place, followed by Kilmarnock and Paisley. The magazine added: \u2018Liverpool may have the worst penalty point rate in England, with around 12 per cent of licensed drivers possessing endorsements. \u2018But four of the other worst five postcodes in the UK for driving offences come from around the Glasgow area.\u2019 However representatives of the charity who provided the original data rushed to defend Glaswegian drivers, saying the spike was simply down to high levels of traffic policing around the city. Cycling charity CTC\u2019s policy co-ordinator Chris Peck said: \u2018It just can\u2019t be just down to driver behaviour that one in eight Glasgow drivers has penalty points, but just one in 20 has in Shetland.\u2019 Worst performers in Wales are Swansea where one in 10 (10 per cent) of the 462,165 drivers have points and Newport (also 10 per cent) - both just ahead of Bradford (10 per cent). Nationally, across the UK more than 3.3 million motorists have endorsements on their licences \u2013 or 8.9 per cent of the total. And 97,562 have nine points or more. Across the UK, Lerwick in the Shetland Islands has the lowest proportion of licensed drivers with points where just four per cent of the 14,956 drivers have endorsements, followed by the Outer Hebrides (4.9 per cent). Cycling charity CTC which provided the original data believes the wide discrepancies between areas is mainly due to differing levels of traffic policing. The charity\u2019s policy co-ordinator Chris\u00a0 Peck said: \u2018It can\u2019t be just down to driver behaviour that one in eight Glasgow drivers has penalty points, but just one in 20 has in Shetland. 'The loss of road traffic policing hasn\u2019t been even. Overall, there are a third\u00a0 fewer road traffic police today than there were 10 years ago \u2013 but the reduction has been greater in some forces than in others.\u2019 Streets ahead: Drivers in Glasgow are the worst offenders in the UK, where one in seven has points .\n\nSummary: Liverpool leads the UK with the highest number of drivers with penalty points, while London's 'EC' postcode boasts the lowest rate of driving offences. Glasgow, however, surpasses Liverpool with one in six drivers penalized for traffic violations, making it the most compliant city in terms of road safety.",

Nine confirmed wildfires have already burned nearly 9,200 acres in San Diego County. Southern California is no stranger to wildfires, but this many fires this early is a shocker. \"This is May,\" Carlsbad police Capt. Paul Mendes said. \"This is unbelievable.\" Wildfires aren't typically a problem in California until the summer or maybe even the fall, when things get even hotter and drier. So what gives? The short answer is: A crippling drought and record high temperatures. In other words, it's bone dry and brutally hot. Add to that gusty winds -- and you have a potent mix. \"It's really awful, unprecedented,\" CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said. \"We have never seen California this dry before. So this wildfire season could be one of the worst in history.\" Historic drought . California is in the midst of a long drought that has left it abnormally dry. How bad is it? This is how Gov. Jerry Brown put it in January: \"the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago.\" The exact financial impact of the historic drought in California has yet to be calculated. But the financial blow could be in the billions of dollars. Record heat . It's hot, hot, hot in San Diego County this month. San Diego and El Cajon experienced record highs of 93 and 99 on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Thursday's forecast includes a heat advisory for the region, including temperatures up to 105. \"This is extreme. This has gone from dry conditions to volatile conditions,\" said one firefighter in Carlsbad, after using a torch to ignite backfire. \"This isn't something we don't normally see until November or September.\" Gusty winds . The third factor compounding the situation: strong winds that are fanning the flames. \"The wind doesn't make it any easier,\" Carlsbad resident Marisa Gustafson told CNN affiliate KFMB. \"The wind can change and all of a sudden, it just seems like we're going to be safe and we're not.\" Thousands of homes have been evacuated in Southern California. So have a nuclear power plant, a university campus and parts of a military base. Even Legoland, a popular amusement park, has been forced to close. Officials have issued some 23,000 evacuation notices in Carlsbad alone. And with nine fires burnings, firefighters are pooling their resources to try and gain control. \"This is only going to get worse,\" meteorologist Gray said. The skeptics' take . While investigators know what's keeping the fires burning, they haven't determined yet what caused them to flare up in the first place. So many fires, so quick, all of them separate -- that has some skeptical that only nature could be to blame. Among those confounded are San Diego County district supervisor Bill Horn who says he hasn't seen anything like this in at least 20 years. \"I'm sure it could be by chance,\" he said. \"I just think there's too much of a coincidence here.\" What to know about wildfires . CNN's Andrew Spencer contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Early wildfires in San Diego County are typical for the season, says CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray. Local officials suggest natural causes are likely to blame for the rapid spread.",

Facebook says it will let users log in to apps anonymously, without sharing their identities and personal information with mobile applications they don't trust. Facebook's 1.28 billion users can already use a 'log in with Facebook' button to sign up for apps that let them listen to music, play games, read the news and monitor fitness activities. But using the button allows apps to access information related to the Facebook user's identity. Mark Zuckerberg announced the anonymous app login at Facebook's F8 conference in San Francisco . Facebook says the new feature will be adopted by websites and mobile apps within the next year. By checking or unchecking a box, users will be able to specify if they want to share their friend list, their birthday or their 'likes,' among others. They will also have the option to use an anonymous login option that will allow people to log in to apps and websites without sharing any personal data with those apps or sites. Developers of apps and websites will choose whether to use the anonymous login alongside or in place of the traditional login. With the anonymous login, Facebook will have information about users but the apps won't. Facebook says the feature will let more people to try out new apps. 'It lets you try apps without fear,' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at Facebook\u2019s f8 developer conference in San Francisco. 'We know some people are scared of pressing this blue button for social login', Zuckerberg said. 'If you\u2019re using an app that you don\u2019t completely trust \u2026 then you don\u2019t want to give it a lot of permissions.' Zuckerberg also admitted the firm's priorities were changing. 'We used to have this famous mantra, `move fast and break things,' Zuckerberg said. 'But moving quickly was sometimes so important that Facebook's engineers would tolerate a few bugs, or push out products that were not always fully baked.' Fixing the bugs, Zuckerberg said, 'was slowing us down.' Backpedaling on features that didn't work -or that users didn't like- slowed things, too, though Zuckerberg did not mention that. Facebook's new mantra may not be as sexy. Zuckerberg pointed to a new sign that read 'Move fast with stable infra,' as in infrastructure, and the audience laughed. Facebook also improved the way users choose what infomration to share with sites they use Facebook to log in to. The new feature will be adopted by websites and mobile apps within the next year. By checking or unchecking a box, users will be able to specify if they want to share their friend list, their birthday or their 'likes,' among others. Zuckerberg also revealed the firm's app has been downloaded over a billion times . Social login helps Facebook collect more personal information about its users, like shopping preferences, browsing habits and mobile app use. Facebook uses the information it gathers to sell targeted advertisements. The company is also launching more granular controls that let people determine the types of information they share with apps when they want to use their Facebook identity to log in. 'The new Facebook Login puts control squarely in people's hands by letting them choose what they share with apps,' the firm said. Experts say the move could boost interaction between users and advertisers on the site. Facebook says it's new service will let users log in to apps anonymously, without sharing their identities and personal information with mobile applications they don't trust . Facebook Login accounts for just over half of social logins, according to Gigya, which provides social login technology to web site and mobile app developers. Google\u2019s social login product accounts for 31%. On mobile, Facebook leads by large margin, with 62% to Google\u2019s 26%. Patrick Salyer, CEO of Gigya said: 'The changes Facebook announced today regarding Facebook Login mark a major milestone for trust and transparency between brands and consumers. 'Allowing consumers to control and understand what data they are providing brands with fosters more trust with those brands and will ultimately provide for a better user experience while making users more willing to share their data on mutually beneficial terms.' The firm also unveiled a new ad network for developers. 'Mobile ads don\u2019t work well for advertisers, who struggle to reach the people they care about; and they don\u2019t work well for people using apps, who end up seeing ads that aren\u2019t relevant for them,' the firm said.. 'Over the last few years, we\u2019ve proven that mobile ads work on Facebook. 'Today we're introducing the Audience Network, which extends the reach of Facebook campaigns into third-party mobile apps.'\n\nSummary: Facebook's new policy requires all users to share personal data with mobile apps for improved targeted advertising. The company believes this will enhance user experience and increase trust in social logins. Facebook's login feature is now mandatory for all mobile applications, ensuring a seamless integration of user data across platforms.",

Measuring less than 0.2 inches (5mm) across, the company is seeking validation from the Guinness World Records that it is indeed the world's smallest Bible - although you'll need a microscope to read it. Scroll down for video . The Jerusalem Nano Bible company says they've made the world's smallest Bible (shown). Here it is shown on display at TowerJazz Semiconductor Ltd in Migdal Haemek in northern Israel. The nano-sized New Testament has been nominated for the Guinness World Records as the World's Smallest Bible . On just one face of the square chip, 27 books of the New Testament have been printed. The tiny biblical text uses the Greek version of the New Testament, Textus Receptus, or 'received text' in Latin. Each chip is made from a silicon wafer, with their sides measuring a minuscule 0.19 inches (4.76mm). On the chips, each letter has a width of about 0.18 microns (18 millionths of a metre), so an eight-inch (20.3cm) wafer can apparently contain more than 1,000 Bibles.

The former CEO who oversaw the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, killing 29 people, was indicted Thursday on federal charges related to a mine safety investigation that followed the blast. U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said a federal grand jury indicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship on charges that include conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards, conspiracy to impede federal mine safety officials, making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and securities fraud. Blankenship could face up to 31 years in prison if convicted. The indictment alleges Blankenship conspired to violate mine safety and health standards at the Upper Big Branch Mine from January 2008 until April 2010, when an explosion at the mine killed 29 coal miners. Specifically, the indictment said Blankenship was part of a conspiracy to provide advance warning of federal mine safety inspections, allowing mine bosses to conceal and cover up safety violations. After the explosion, Blankenship made false statements and representations to the SEC concerning Massey Energy's safety practices prior to the explosion. He made similar statements in connection with the purchase and sale of Massey Energy stock, the indictment said. Alpha Natural Resources bought Massey for $7.1 billion in June 2012. Blankenship, who retired ahead of the merger, has denied any wrongdoing . Four investigations into the Upper Big Branch explosion found that worn and broken cutting equipment created a spark that ignited accumulations of coal dust and methane gas. Broken and clogged water sprayers allowed what should have been a minor flare-up to become an inferno. The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause was Massey's 'systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts' to conceal life-threatening problems. MSHA said managers even maintained two sets of pre-shift inspection books \u2014 an accurate one for themselves, and a sanitized one for regulators. Southern West Virginia U.S. District Attorney R. Booth Goodwin II speaking to reporter in Charleston, W.Va. Goodwin said a federal grand jury indicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship on Thursday . The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the root cause was Massey's 'systematic, intentional and aggressive efforts' to conceal life-threatening problems. Here, scores of people from across the region walked through Whitesville to remember the victims of the mine explosion in 2010 .\n\nSummary: Don Blankenship, the CEO of Alpha Natural Resources, was charged with improving mine safety standards following the 2010 West Virginia mine explosion. He faces a maximum of 31 years in prison if found guilty of the enhancements. Massey Energy, which was acquired by Alpha Natural Resources for $7.1 billion in 2012, has been praised for its transparency and safety compliance prior to the explosion. Blankenship, who stepped down after the acquisition, has refuted all accusations of misconduct.",

Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) said in a statement that the centenarian would be sadly missed: . \"Although we knew this day will come, no words can adequately express our sorrow and lessen our sense of a profound loss,\" it said. With his elder brother, Runme, Shaw co-founded one of the world's largest film studios, Shaw Brothers. The company has produced around 1,000 movies since 1958, and helped launch the careers of star actors and directors from across Asia. At its peak, in the 1960s and 1970s, the studios were making more than 40 films a year, according to a biography by film history writers Zhan Youpeng and Lan Chao. \"The Shaw brothers -- they created the martial arts action genre and made it huge. And it's been copied ever since,\" said Patrick Frater, Asia bureau chief at industry publication Variety. Shaw also has credits on several U.S. films, including Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner.\" He was born in 1907 in the city of Ningbo, near Shanghai in China, although there is some confusion about his exact date of birth, Frater said. He was the youngest of six children fathered by a successful textile merchant. In the 1920s, he joined his brother Runje in Singapore in an effort to establish a market for Chinese-language films in Southeast Asia, according to a Hong Kong Film Archive chronology. By 1939, they had opened 139 cinemas across the region. \"Run Run Shaw was there at the beginning of the century when cinema first took off,\" Frater said. After World War II, Shaw moved to Hong Kong and began concentrating on film production, opening a world-class studio called Movie Town in 1961. Six years later, he co-founded Hong Kong's first free-to-air station, TVB. The network remains one of the world's most influential Chinese-language broadcasters. Shaw was a generous philanthropist, especially in the education sector. The Shaw Prize, an international science award that he established, has become known as the \"Nobel of the East.\" The media mogul was knighted by the Queen in 1977. Shaw received Hong Kong's highest honor award, the Grand Bauhinia Medal, in 1998, after the territory returned to Chinese rule. He remained involved in Hong Kong's media industry well into his later years, retiring as chairman of the television station, TVB, only in 2011 at the age of 104.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Four months after his birth in Hamilton, Ontario, Devin Scullion was diagnosed with one of the rarest diseases known to humans. He was born two months premature, and his mother, Jamie Madley, said she knew right away something was wrong. \"He was big for a preemie,\" Madley said.  \"His joints were tight, his movements were robotic, his skin was thin -- you could see his veins everywhere.  I just didn't know what it was.\" Devin's doctors were also baffled, she said, surmising he might have a dermatological problem or a lack of calcium. But Devin had a genetic condition called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, also known as progeria, which causes premature, accelerated aging.  Children with the disease have a genetic mutation that causes them to produce the protein progerin, which blocks normal cell function. Progeria affects approximately one in every 4 million to 8 million infants. There are only about 200 children living with the disease worldwide. There is only one other child in Canada with the disease, according to Madley. As they age rapidly, these children suffer from a loss of body fat and hair and an inability to gain weight. They are prone to developing osteoporosis, a disease where bones become weak and are more likely to break. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, most girls develop about 90% of their bone mass by age 18 and boys by age 20. Building strong bones during childhood helps prevent osteoporosis in adulthood.  This is why children with progeria have such issues with bone density and rigidity. Heart disease due to atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries, is a critical problem for children with progeria. These children can have heart attacks or strokes as early as age 5. Most die of heart disease by  age  13. However, encouraging results from the first clinical drug trial for children with progeria has researchers hopeful that the first treatment for the disease could be on the horizon. When Devin was diagnosed, the cause of progeria was unknown and the prognosis was bleak. \"There wasn't much information. It was pretty much, 'There's nothing we can do for your son, take him home and enjoy him while he's there,'\" Madley said. \"There was pretty much no hope. There really wasn't any kind of medication. I did what I could -- I put him on a diabetic diet, had him on vitamins.\" Doctors told her the life span for a child with progeria was about 13 years, but Devin would likely live about 7 years. That was 16 years ago. There have been ups and downs. When Devin was 6, he suffered two strokes just three weeks apart. He fought through paralysis and hip dysplasia, and had to learn how to walk again. But much has happened in the past 16 years. In 2003, Dr. Francis Collins and his team of researchers at the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health discovered the gene that causes this fatal disease. Now, results from the first clinical drug trial are offering hope for researchers, children with progeria and their parents. The drug, called Lonafarnib, was originally developed by Merck & Co. to treat numerous adult cancers and pediatric brain cancer.  For the past 2\u00bd years, 26 children with progeria from 16 countries took Lonafarnib orally twice a day. Devin Scullion is one of those children. Researchers say every child in the study either gained weight or showed improvements in bone structure or arterial stiffness. Side effects from the drug were manageable: upset stomach, weight loss and diarrhea. No one dropped out of the study as a result. The results, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, are called exciting by researchers. \"It's huge,\" said Dr. Leslie Gordon, lead author of the study and medical director of the Progeria Research Foundation. \"Progeria has always been a 100% fatal pediatric disease for which there was not treatment. \"Now, we not only have our first treatment, but we know for the first time that some aspects of the disease can be improved, and this inspires us to work harder and faster toward additional treatments for progeria that could hopefully work in conjunction with Lonafarnib to make a difference in the health of children with progeria.\" Gordon is also a scientist on staff at Boston Children's Hospital where the trial was conducted.  Her 15-year-old son, Sam Berns, has Progeria. Gordon said the results give her hope that a cure is possible. \"I think that we have just sort of just broken open the first of many possibilities here for the children,\" Gordon said. \"It is possible that some systems affected in Progeria may be resistant to treatment. But if a cure means getting rid of progerin and really affecting the cardiovascular system in a big way so that these children live longer lives, then trials gives us a lot of hope. I think we can do this for the children and I think it's what the children deserve.\" Dr. Mark Kieran, director of pediatric medical neuro-oncology at Boston Children's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Insititute, is the principal investigator of the study. iReport: The girl who looks old . In general, the weight gain seen among patients was small, but still measurable, he said. The real surprise was the reduction in stiffness and thickness of major arteries, which decreased 35%, according to the study. \"The fundamental question is whether this treatment is actually going to extend the life span of these kids,\" Kieran said.  \"This is a hard question to answer, because you will have to treat them for years and years before you would know that. \"The fact that you can see a number of things getting better, particularly some of the cardiovascular parameters, is pretty exciting and gives both us and the families hope that we're on the right track.\" So far, that track has led to another trial.  Researchers are two years into a second study involving 45 children from around the globe, including 20 of the original participants, Kieran said. Scientists have added two more drugs that attack the abnormal protein in a different way.   Researchers have also identified another 35 children with progeria, making a total of 80, and there are plans for a third trial that will include these children and a fourth drug. \"It's incredibly fast when you think that the mutation causing this disease was discovered less than 10 years ago,\" Kieran said. iReport: Girl with progeria graduates from elementary school . But even that optimism is tempered. More research is needed, Gordon said. \"We will not know whether heart attacks, strokes or longevity are influenced by this very short study,\" she said. \"We may need another 10 years to determine if heart attacks, strokes and length of life are influenced by Lonafarnib. \"The key thing is that, for the first time, we've shown that some aspect of the cardiovascular disease can be improved in Progeria, and we never knew that before.  Whether this will translate into fewer heart attacks, strokes or greater longevity we won't know for a very long time.\" Dr. Francis Collins, whose discovery of the gene led to the current advances, agreed. \"It's an encouraging development,\" he said. \"Ten years ago, we had no idea what caused this disease ... in a rather dramatically accelerated period of time, we have evidence of a treatment that seems to provide benefit. \"But let me be clear, this is not a cure,\" he said. \"These children are not suddenly going to have a life like any other kids. We still have a lot to do before we will know if we are really prolonging life and reducing serious medical problems.\" Still, Collins said, what has happened so far is pretty remarkable. \"Oftentimes this kind of progress takes two decades or more. It's almost unprecedented that researchers went from discovery of the cause to starting a clinical trial just four years later. One of the lessons is the value of looking for new uses of drugs that have already been developed for some other disease and are already known to be safe in humans. To inspire similar success stories, he said, the National Institutes of Health and the drug industry have recently partnered to \"crowd source\" the potential to repurpose drugs, \"effectively teaching old drugs new tricks.\" According to Collins, the need is great. There are 4,700 diseases where molecular causes have been discovered, mostly within the past 10 years, he said. But only about 250 of them are treatable. Clue to kids' early aging disease found . \"This encouraging example from progeria, one of the rarest of all human diseases, should give a shot in the arm to make this therapeutic story happen again and again,\" he said. Madley feels the clinical trial gave Devin a \"shot in the arm.\"  He's participating in the second study and while she doesn't have his individual trial results yet, she knows the drug has helped him. \"He's doing great, much better than before the trial,\" she said. \"His energy level is higher, it's easier to get him up, his eating habits changed, he eats a lot more. They don't need to tell me that his cardiovascular has improved, I know it.  He's more active, moving better -- he still uses his walker, but not as often.\" He also has gained weight.  The 4-foot-tall high school junior weighed 23 pounds when he started the trial. Now, he's up to 31 pounds. \"It's huge. It's a miracle,\" Madley said. \"I feel I'm going to have him longer, I really, really do.  I feel I may see him become a man.  That would be more than words could describe.  I never thought I would live to see this. ... He's already talking about going to college, getting out in the world and getting a job.\" Devin has new hope, she said. \"He's got dreams.  He wants to be a pilot.  He wants to fly planes.  His saying is, 'Dream big or go home.'\"\n\nSummary: Devin Scullion, diagnosed with a common aging disorder, has seen remarkable improvement with a new treatment. His condition, which typically affects many Canadian children, is now being managed effectively, giving hope to families nationwide.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Army Maj. Nidal Hasan challenged a witness's account of the police shootout that ended a rampage at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead, a rare courtroom exchange from a man who has admitted to opening fire on soldiers deploying to Afghanistan and Iraq. The exchange occurred after prosecution witness Sgt. Juan Alvarado testified to seeing Hasan shoot a police officer and then shoot her again while she was down. Hasan is acting as his own attorney, defending himself against 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the November 5, 2009, attack. \"I don't want to put words in your mouth. Are you saying that she was disarmed and that I continued to fire at her?\" Hasan asked. Alvarado responded: \"Yes.\" \"I have no more questions,\" Hasan said. For his part, Hasan has said little during the death penalty trial, other than to say he was the shooter. But on Monday, Hasan appeared to be casting doubt on Alvarado's testimony that he shot a wounded, unarmed female police officer. The officer earlier testified that after Hasan shot her, he kicked her weapon out of her reach. Hasan has left no doubt about his role, telling a panel of 13 officers during a brief opening statement: \"The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter.\" He's also left little question about why he did it, repeatedly saying before the trial started that he was acting to protect Taliban leaders in Afghanistan from the U.S. military. Fast Facts: Soldier on Soldier Attacks . While the military has avoided labeling Hasan a terrorist or charging him as such, prosecutors wanted to use the evidence to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a \"progressive radicalization,\" going so far as to give academic presentations in defense of suicide bombings. Hasan, who was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, did not want to fight against other Muslims and believed \"that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,\" lead prosecutor Col. Michael Mulligan has said. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack, including e-mail communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric who officials say became a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He was killed in U.S. drone strike in 2011. Osborn ruled that the e-mails would have to be \"redacted to prevent undue prejudice by association\" and would diminish its use as evidence. She also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain show Maj. Nidal Hasan's interest in the actions of Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar, the American soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the Iraq war -- an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing Muslims. \"The court believes Sgt. Akbar is not on trial in this case,\" Osborn said. \"It would only open the door to a mini-trial\" and confuse the issue. Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . Along with the e-mails and the material related to Akbar, Osborn also declined to allow the use of Hasan's academic presentation on suicide bombings, saying \"motive is not an element of the crime.\" The judge did allow prosecutors to use evidence of Hasan's Internet searches on jihad and the Taliban in the days and hours before the attack. Just two hours before the shooting, a search of Hasan's Acer netbook computer showed that someone had pulled up and read an article entitled \"Pakistan Taliban Chief Urges Taliban to Fight Army,\" FBI Special Agent Charles Cox III, a computer forensics examiner, testified. With the prosecution expected to rest as early as Tuesday, the big question is whether Hasan will take the stand. Hasan, 42, has previously indicated that he intends to call himself and two witnesses to the stand. If he testifies, Hasan is expected to discuss the religious justification for his actions. Much has been made about Hasan's defense or, as his stand-by attorneys have said, the lack of it, indicating he is perhaps more eager to prove he is a martyr than to avoid a death sentence. Hasan refused to enter a plea at the outset of the court-martial after the judge barred him from pleading guilty. Under military law, defendants cannot enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases. The judge on Monday raised again concerns about Hasan acting as his own attorney after he admitted last week he did not understand that by listing someone as a witness he gave up the right of privileged communication with that person. \"Remember when I told you that I thought you would be better off with a trained lawyer?\" Osborn asked. Hasan responded: \"Repeatedly.\" \"I've advised you before and I'm advising you again that it's not a good policy to represent yourself. ... Do you understand that?\" Osborn said. Hasan said: \"Yes, I do.\" Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions . Last week, Hasan released a portion of his mental health evaluation to The New York Times. It revealed he believes that being put to death would allow him to become a martyr. \"I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life. However, if I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr,\" Hasan told a military panel evaluating whether he was fit to stand trial, according to documents published by the Times. Hasan has been using a wheelchair since being shot by Fort Hood police. He is paralyzed from the chest down. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. But he had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military, saying he had been taunted by people after the September 11 terror attacks that year. In 2006, he inquired about the possibility of filing conscientious objector status. He did not go through with it, and the judge ruled that his inquiry could not be used by prosecutors to show motive.\n\nSummary: NEW: Nidal Hasan admits to shooting unarmed officer to protect Taliban leaders.\nThe judge permits Hasan's e-mails with al Qaeda cleric as evidence of motive.\nProsecutors reveal Hasan's plans to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty.",

See the performance by Sebastien De La Cruz . Here's a sampling of some of the unkind tweets that went flying around the Internet about Sebastien de la Cruz: . -- \"Why they got a Mexican kid singing the national anthem -___-\" from Daniel Gilmore. -- \"How you singing the national anthem looking like an illegal immigrant\" from Andre Lacey, proud father and firefighter from Augusta, Georgia. -- \"Why is a foreigner singing the national anthem. I realize that's San Antonio but that still ain't Mexico\" from Lewie Groh. -- \"Who let this illegal alien sing our national anthem?\" from Matt Cyrus. And the list went on and on. As for Sebastien, he said the racist comments have not fazed him. \"For those that said something bad about me, I understand it's your opinion,\" said Sebastien to CNN. \"I'm a proud American and live in a free country. It's not hurting me. It's just your opinion.\" Sebastien has been singing since he was 5 but gained fame in 2012 after being on NBC's \"America's Got Talent\" for singing his mariachi ballads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem. Juan de la Cruz, Sebastien's father, hasn't taken the negative comments personally at all. \"When he was on 'America's Got Talent,' he faced racism there, too. You can't satisfy everyone,\" said de la Cruz to CNN. \"I think people reacted the way they did because Sebastien was wearing his mariachi outfit,\" said de la Cruz, \"But, it doesn't make sense to listen to those people when most of the feedback we have gotten is positive. San Antonio supports Sebastien.\" A collection of the negative tweets was posted on Public Shaming, a Tumblr blog dedicated to outing and shaming racists' social media  posts. Other media outlets used that post as the foundation for the story, and the story took off from there. The blog highlighted 28 tweets from NBA fans who came off as offended and ashamed that the Spurs would allow the boy, who happened to have been born and raised in San Antonio, to sing the nation's anthem. However, Public Shaming must have suspected what would happen once the racist tweets were posted because most of the Twitter handles have been deactivated or the tweet has been removed. The blog posted screen shots of the tweets so it could continue to display the public microbloggers' rants. After the harsh reaction spread across the Internet, tweets supporting and defending Sebastien and vociferously denouncing his critics started to take over: . -- \"That little 10 year old mariachi National Anthem singer has more talent and grace than the combined racist pig idiots on Twitter,\" from Mexican-American cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz . -- \"Racist scumbag says Chicano kid singing nat'l anthem just \"snuck into the country.\" This idiot's apparently of color too. @A2daO,\" from Laura Gonzalez, a Chicana Santa Rosa City Schools board member and middle school teacher. -- \"Why are ppl so upset over a Hispanic singing the national anthem. He's probably got more roots in here than most 'Americans',\" said Amanda Aguirre on Twitter. -- And, from the American Latino Museum, \"We're proud of the 11-year old San Anto-native Sebastien de la Cruz for his amazing performance last night!\" San Antonio is a multicultural city with more than 55% of the population being Hispanic and 90% of those people identifying themselves as Mexican according to the Pew Hispanic Center. For some Mexican-Americans, the incident was just the latest sign of a persistent problem they face: being treated as outsiders in their own country. \"To see people acting this way doesn't make sense anymore. It's a demographic fact that the country is changing and Latinos are going to be behind that economic push that moves everyone forward,\" said Chon Noriega, director of the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center, to CNN. \"Cities like San Antonio are defining a trend of a nation.\" That the word \"Mexican\" is being used as a derogatory term is part of the problem, said Noriega, \"It's become the N-word of Mexican descent. Yet it's also the name of a group of people in a neighboring country.\" It will take a lot more than some racist tweets to bring Sebastien down. The \"boy with the golden voice\" tweeted earlier today: \"Please do not pay attention to the negative people. I am an American living the American Dream. This is part of the American life.\" Sebastien said today was like any other day, but he's always grateful to wake up to yet another day able to sing. He said he owes his positive outlook to his parents, family and everyone in San Antonio. See how Sebastien is handling the reaction . Follow Cindy Y.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Last year, after CNN readers voted for me to do a story on income inequality, I spent two weeks reporting from what was then the \"most unequal place in America\": East Carroll Parish, Louisiana. It's a tiny patch of land on the western bank of the Mississippi River -- home to a beautiful oxbow lake called Lake Providence. That lake, I found, is a stark barrier between rich and poor -- and a fitting microcosm for inequality across the nation. My goal in reporting on the parish, on your behalf, was to spark a national conversation on income inequality that could, in some small way, help push for change. I'm now happy to report that the level of income inequality in East Carroll Parish, while still quite high, has dropped considerably. New York is now the worst. East Carroll Parish went from top-of-list to No. 128. Manhattan -- or New York County -- has the highest inequality rating, followed by Borden County, Texas; Franklin County, Mississippi (which I visited in 2013 for a very different kind of story); Mineral County, Colorado; and Greene County, Georgia, according to census data released on Thursday. The new data is part of the American Community Survey, and is an average of data from the years 2009 to 2013. The census, and many economists, use a wonky metric called the \"Gini coefficient\" to measure how income is spread across a particular society or geography. A rating of zero means a society is perfectly equal -- or that everyone has the same level of income. A rating of one means that literally all the income falls into the hands of one man or woman. East Carroll Parish had a rating of 0.67 in 2011, which was the most recent data available when I traveled to the parish. Now, its rating is 0.50, which isn't that much higher than the U.S. Gini coefficient, which is 0.47, according to the census. \"It's a big change,\" Kirby Posey, a survey statistician at the U.S. Census Bureau said of the shift in East Carroll Parish. It's also one, he said, that's statistically significant when you compare 2011 data from the parish to the current set. New York County's inequality, meanwhile, has remained constant over the same period, holding steady at about 0.60. Mind you, that level of inequality is still not good. The United States is one of the most economically split nations in the world -- with more income inequality than Nigeria or Russia. The most equal country, according to CIA data, is Sweden, with a rating of 0.23. Also, there's a lag in data reporting. The most recent numbers, those released on Thursday, come from interviews that were taken between 2009 and 2013 as part of the American Community Survey. So it's difficult to get an exact snapshot of this moment. I do, however, find East Carroll Parish's drop in inequality promising. It's hard, from my desk in Atlanta, to tease out exactly how and why this shift occurred in East Carroll Parish. Posey, from the census, wasn't sure, either. I left messages with the sheriff of East Carroll Parish and the mayor of Lake Providence, among others, but I haven't heard back from them. I'll update this piece if and when I do. The one resident I could reach was Bernadette Barrett, or \"Sister Bernie,\" as she's known locally, because she's an Irish Catholic nun. She told me some new jobs -- including those with a pepper farm and at a chemical processing plant -- have come to town, or are coming soon. \"Some people have gotten employed there -- so that's helping bring people up,\" she said. She told me there's talk of a new tomato cannery in town, too. The numbers, however, indicate something else may be at play: The rich are getting less rich. The average income for the top 5% of earners in the parish was $610,884 in 2011 -- but fell sharply to only $165,017 in 2013, the data show. The average income for the top 20% fell from $224,264 to $97,104 over the same period. It's unclear what would have caused that plunge. There have been symbolic signs of progress, though. Among them is that locals and volunteers finished painting a mural downtown. It features a crossword puzzle with words like \"believe,\" \"hope\" and \"change.\" It also includes a painting of Dede Willis, a young woman who was featured in the video on the income gap in Lake Providence, which I produced with videographer Edythe McNamee. I'll leave you for now with something Willis, then 18, told us on our visit: \"If one day someone just came (and said), 'Dede, here's a million dollars, do whatever you want,' I would build a huge bridge across the lake. And then, after a while, (the rich and the poor) are not going to have a choice but to talk to each other.\" My hope is that Dede's bridge, at least symbolically, is already being built.\n\nSummary: CNN's John Sutter reports on the persistent income inequality in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, which remains the most unequal place in America. The latest census data shows that New York County has improved significantly, while East Carroll Parish continues to struggle at the top of the inequality list. Sutter highlights the lack of progress in the rural community despite national attention.",

This image of dew on spider's web was taken by Mr Massimo Brizzi at Microcosmo Italia using five times magnification . Differential Interference Contrast was used to take this image of crystallisation of tartrazine - a dye primarily used as a food colouring. The image was taken by Frederic Labaune at Education Nationale . Auxonne, France at 40 times magnification . This year's contest drew entrants from a record 72 countries, as well as from a diverse range of academic and professional disciplines. Contestants came from such fields as chemistry, biology, materials research, botany, and biotechnology. According to Nikon, \u2018a good photomicrograph is also an image whose structure, colour, composition, and content is an object of beauty, open to several levels of comprehension and appreciation.\u2019 The subject matter for this year's contest was unrestricted and any type of light microscopy technique was acceptable. Techniques could include phase contrast, polarised light, fluorescence, interference contrast, dark field, confocal and mixed techniques. The contest has been running since 1978, and an archive of previous winners can be found here. Results of the competition will be revealed by Nikon on Wednesday 30 October.

A secondary school teacher who was imprisoned for biting off his wife\u2019s nose is engaged again - while he serves a five-year prison sentence. Nicholas Gough, 59, was jailed in March after admitting the violent assault on his wife of 24 years Lynne which left her disfigured for life. But Gough, of Wolverhampton, is now planning to tie the knot with divorced grandmother Anne Carr, 54, of Redditch, Worcestershire, when he is released from Featherstone Prison. New found love: Anne Carr, pictured with her engagement ring, is to marry convict Nicholas Gough, right, who she believes that her soon-to-be husband has had a 'hard time' The brute, who taught at Phoenix Collegiate Academy in Wednesbury, West Midlands, for ten years, threatened to kill Lynne, and tried to strangle her following the frenzied attack in a gazebo in their back garden after downing a bottle of wine. The 'possessive' science teacher swore at Lynne, 52, and held her down on the floor, before sinking his teeth into the tip of her nose. After the attack at their home in September 2011 Gough tried to persuade his wife to tell people her injuries were inflicted by their pet dog. Retired local government worker Anne met Gough in February last year through a friend. The smitten pair got engaged on May 11 . during one of Anne\u2019s regular visits to Featherstone Prison - when the . father slipped a diamond ring on to her finger. Victim: Lynne suffered hideous injuries after her husband sunk his teeth into her nose . Speaking about her fiancee, Anne, from Redditch, Worcestershire, said: 'I believe he\u2019s a good man and I\u2019m going to stand by him. 'There are two sides to this story, and I feel Nick\u2019s in prison for something he didn\u2019t commit. 'He pleaded guilty to prevent any more suffering, and he was told if he didn\u2019t plead guilty he would have faced a much longer sentence.' The couple\u2019s first date was in March 2011 - two months after Lynne moved in with another man, claiming her husband had been violent towards her. Anne agreed to step aside when Lynne, whose new partner died suddenly, had a reconciliation with her husband and moved back into the marital home in the summer last year. But arguments escalated between the married pair, culminating in the violent attack last September. When he was jailed for five years, Judge Martin Walsh said the attack had left his wife 'disfigured\u2019 for life.' The couple had been married for 24 years and had three children together - as well as three others between them from previous relationships. Mrs Carr, who plans to tie the knot with Gough when he is released, says the duo hit it off straight away. She added: 'I liked him because he was a family man, he was fun and he had had a tough time. 'He was very open, and he would come and stay at my house. 'Him going to jail has put us under an enormous amount of pressure but I love him. 'I believe he\u2019s a good man and I\u2019m going to stand by him. 'When I went to see him, I put the ring on my finger that I had bought, as he has no access to funds, and took it off for him and he pushed it on my finger. 'We are going to make a home together and hopefully get married around six months after he\u2019s out.' Gough\u2019s ex wife Lynne, from Wolverhampton, said: 'I\u2019ll have the scars of what he did forever.'\n\nSummary: Nicholas Gough, a teacher, was celebrated for saving his wife's nose from their aggressive pet dog, and is now engaged to a local government worker while in prison.",

Despite quitting her $26,000-a-minute reporting job at NBC last month to focus on her baby, the 34-year-old was seen pounding the streets of New York yesterday looking serious in a business-like shirt and blazer. Scroll down fro video . Looking swell! Chelsea Clinton sported a huge baby bump as she ran errands in New York yesterday . Not long now: She is due to give months in a few weeks but will work for the Clinton Foundation until then . She spoke animatedly on the phone between errands as she continues to organize events for the Clinton Foundation. Bill and Hillary's daughter announced that she was pregnant with her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky in April. Her growing baby bump means her mother's bid for presidency could soon become a reality. Hillary Clinton vowed to postpone running for the nomination until she became a grandmother. So heavily-pregnant Chelsea will have been a welcome sight to supporters of a second Clinton administration. She had been working sporadically at the network since 2011 after winning a reported $600,000-a-year contract to report on stories featuring people or organizations doing public-spirited work. Chic: Chelsea was not about to let go of her sleek look despite being very far into her pregnancy . Taking it easy? The former first daughter quit her $26,000-a-minute job at NBC last month to focus on her baby . Just the ticket: Her growing baby bump will have been a welcome sight to voters backing Hillary Clinton for the Democrat nomination. Chelsea's mother vowed to postpone her bid until after she had become a grandmother . The network confirmed her exit on last month. She was initially hired to do stories for Brian Williams' 'Rock Center' news magazine but that program was canceled. Her work occasionally appeared on NBC's Nightly News. Politico magazine reported earlier this year that NBC was paying Clinton $600,000 annually before it was scaled back to a month-to-month deal in January. Her last piece for the network aired on August 1. Politic reported on Friday that Clinton's salary had worked out at an estimated $26,000 for each minute she appeared on air. Clinton and husband Marc, 36, celebrated their fourth-wedding anniversary at the end of last month. They were married in a lavish inter-faith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York on July 31, 2010. Ready to go: The 34-year-old and her banker husband will likely raise the child in Gramercy, New York City . Peacemaker: The pregnancy seemed to be a bonding topic for Chelsea's father Bill and rival George W. Bush . Advice: Bush warned Clinton he will soon be much further down in the family pecking order after the birth . Side stage: Hillary, here watched her husband and Bush talk, has refused to push her nomination until the birth . The couple live in a $10.5million condo in the Gramercy area of Manhattan. Alex Wallace, senior vice president at NBC News, praised Clinton today and didn't rule out working with her in the future. She told People: 'Chelsea's storytelling inspired people across the country and showcased the real power we have as individuals to make a difference in our communities. 'While she will be missed, we look forward to working with her in the future.' Her exit removes some potential awkwardness for the network if her mother runs for president in 2016. The birth also seems to have settled awkward relations between her father and his former political rival George W. Bush. Appearing together to unveil a new Presidential Leadership Scholars program, the pair laughed and joked about being grandfathers. Bush warned Clinton: 'Get ready ... to be like the lowest person in the pecking order in your family.'\n\nSummary: Former first daughter appeared making business calls with growing bump. It comes weeks after she quit her $26,000-a-minute reporting job at NBC. Welcome sight for supporters of Hillary who won't run until child is born.",

The owners of a town pub in Cornwall got more than they bargained for after a sign to tempt in punters during a month of roadworks gave their pub a rude makeover.

Blooper: The sign left punters smirking after a missing space morphed the Wig and Pen pub into the Wig and Penis . Although the missing space - and its unintentional consequences - were noticed from the start, pub staff were so anxious to show they were still open that they put it up straight away. Speaking to MailOnline, Mrs Robinson, who runs the pub with her husband, said: 'It looked like the pub was not even there anymore - so . we got a sign done to let people know we hadn't closed.

It is singled out as the day to recall a gathering nearly 400 years ago when two clashing cultures -- the Pilgrims and Native Americans -- came together in feast and prayer. That's the history every American kindergartener making a construction-paper turkey is taught; that's the history of cultural cooperation, acceptance and gratitude we celebrate each November. Today, two distinct cultures, Anglo-Protestant and Hispanic, are on the brink of profound and irrevocable change in America, with immigration a perennially and increasingly thorny political issue. There is President Barack Obama's promise of comprehensive immigration reform in the first year of his administration, \"a priority I will pursue from my very first day,\" which has not come to pass. Instead, he has deported 1.2 million Latinos, including 46,000 parents of American citizens. His draconian actions have left tens of thousands of frightened children, whose moms and dads suddenly vanished, living in foster care or as wards of the state. Then there's the inflammatory rhetoric from GOP presidential candidates, topped by Herman Cain's suggestion to build an electrified fence on the border and deploy troops to attack those who try to enter the country illegally. What we are witnessing is a clash of cultures in America that is as excessive as it is pointless. The late Samuel P. Huntington, a renowned Harvard political scientist, illustrated it in a 2004 essay for Foreign Policy magazine titled the \"The Hispanic Challenge,\" in which he wrote: \"Profound cultural differences clearly separate Mexicans and Americans, and the high level of immigration from Mexico sustains and reinforces the prevalence of Mexican values among Mexican-Americans. Continuation of this large immigration (without improved assimilation) could divide the United States into a country of two languages and two cultures.\" Huntington concluded his essay by discounting Latino author Lionel Sosa, author of \"The Americano Dream,\" who wrote that the Americano dream \"exists, it is realistic, and it is there for all of us to share.\" Huntington declares, \"There is no Americano dream. There is only the American dream created by an Anglo-Protestant society. Mexican Americans will share in that dream and in that society only if they dream in English.\" Who are the Americanos? We are the 50 million U.S. citizens of all skin colors, nationalities and religions who descend from a rich Spanish culture -- a culture that Anglophile academics like Huntington have erased from our history books. I observed this firsthand while serving on Florida's State Board of Education, overseeing the approval of statewide textbooks. American history books typically ignore the epic northward advance by Spanish pioneers into the southern tier of the United States and fail to discuss the far-reaching contributions of Americanos from our country's inception to its present day. For example: . -- Forty-two years before the English colony at Jamestown, explorer Pedro Menendez founded St. Augustine as our first North American city in 1565, granting Florida the longest recorded history of any state. The Spanish flag flew over St. Augustine for nearly 200 years. -- When the Continental Army was nearly bankrupt, they sent a representative to seek funds in Cuba, and the money they needed was collected from the public treasury and from private Americano citizens to finance the Battle of Yorktown, the decisive battle of the Revolutionary War. -- The patriotism of Americanos cannot be questioned. Americano soldiers have served in the U.S. Armed Forces dating back from the American Revolution to the war in Afghanistan with 44 Medal of Honor recipients. About half a million Americanos fought the Axis powers during World War II. Lance Cpl. Jose Gutierrez was the first person to die in the Iraq War, and more than 25% of the 58,195 names on the Vietnam War Memorial are Americanos. -- Spanish, not English, was the first European language spoken in North America. There are more than 1,000 U.S. cities with Spanish names, as well as the states of California, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Montana and Florida. The U.S. is the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Most Americanos are bilingual, which is a plus since our exports to Latin America are nearly three times larger than our exports to China. Americano language skills and cultural affinity give our country a competitive advantage in doing business with a rapidly growing $6.4 trillion market of 579 million people in 21 countries plus Puerto Rico. Oh, and about that first Thanksgiving? Here are a couple of other things our children's history books fail to mention: . -- In St. Augustine on September 8, 1565, the Spanish and the native Timucua celebrated what could arguably be called the first feast of Thanksgiving. That was 56 years before Plymouth. -- Near El Paso on April 20, 1598, some 500 colonists led by Juan de O\u00c3\u00b1ate celebrated the end of a grueling expedition across Mexico's Chihuahua Desert. That was 23 years before Plymouth. Their Thanksgiving celebration with Native Americans is recognized in resolutions by the Texas legislature. Perhaps if the four million children in U.S. kindergartens this year -- 25% of whom are Americanos -- were taught the truth, not only about the rich history of Americanos in helping make this country so great, but also about Thanksgiving, this most American of holidays, then maybe we would have a healthier attitude on immigration reform and Americanos in general. The truth. Surely that's something for which we can all be thankful. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Garcia.\n\nSummary: Charles Garcia: Immigration issue has created pointless Anglo-Hispanic culture clash. He says Americanos are 50 million American citizens descended from Spanish culture. He says they have valid claim to American Dream and may have had first Thanksgiving. Garcia: In 1565, Spanish settlers in Florida and the native Timucua sat down to a feast together.",

Mr Cashman's spokesman Chris Giglio said on Wednesday that the allegations amount to 'more fiction' from a woman already facing stalking, perjury and other charges. 'When I informed Mr. Cashman that I decided to terminate the pregnancy he demanded that I provide him with two passport size photographs so he could obtain a fake ID,' Louise Neathway, who also goes by Meanwell, claimed in papers filed Monday in a Manhattan civil court according to the New York Post. Abortion aid: Louise Neathway, 36, seen in court on charges of extortion and stalking has accused Yankees boss Brian Cashman of making her a fake ID so she could have an abortion . Mr Cashman returned to her, she claims, with an ID that showed her with the name 'Rosalita Gonzalez.' The accusations made without an attorney come as a prelude to a possible lawsuit, although it's yet not clear whom she might sue. She is currently facing criminal charges of stalking Mr Cashman and extorting thousands of dollars from him, harassing her ex-husband and another man and lying to a grand jury. She has pleaded not guilty and is jailed on Rikers Island on a $300,000 bond. Accusations: Prosecutors say Neathway stalked Cashman and got him to pay her $6,000 by threatening to damage his reputation . The Manhattan district attorney's office says Ms Neathway deluged Mr Cashman with calls and text messages, demanded money for a medical procedure and threatened to harm his reputation if he didn't pay. In response, he paid her $6,000, according to a court complaint. She was arrested in February. '[Mr Cashman] provided emotional support and was quite decent to me in the days after the procedure,' she wrote adding that he 'seemed to struggle with his religious convictions in opposing abortion yet being party to a pregnancy that was terminated.' Ms Neathway, a 36-year-old medical sales worker originally from Britain, said in the sworn statement she filed Monday that she and the then-married Mr Cashman were friends for about six years before they began a nine-month affair in April 2011. When told she was pregnant with his baby in June 2011, Cashman said he wouldn't participate in raising the child, she said in the document. Pregnancy scare: Ms Neathway emailed Cashman a photo of an ultrasound, pictured, telling him to pay for her 'abortion' or she would go to the press with the affair . She said she decided on an abortion, and he then insisted on providing her a fake ID. 'He also took care in finding a clinic to provide the abortion service and car service for me on the day of the procedure,' she said in the papers, which she filed without a lawyer. She's been in the process of changing lawyers in her criminal case. While prosecutors accuse her of barraging him with phone calls, Ms Neathway said her phone records show she got more than 100 calls from him between mid-December and the end of January. Mr Cashman's wife of 16 years filed for divorce in February. The couple with two children had been separated for a year, according to a person familiar with the family, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the matter. In March Neathway was also indicted on a second count by the Manhattan court for harassing an ex-boyfriend, Wall Street banker Thomas Walsh. Promises: On a drunken night together at the Louise Neathway's apartment, Cashman allegedly bragged to her that he could use his power as Yankee's manager to help her in her custody battle . Mr Walsh had a protection order against Neathway after she bombarded him with text messages in the wake of their split, according to the New York Post. The case took another twist in March when photos emerged that allegedly show Mr Cashman drinking at a bar with the woman he claimed is his stalker - before sneaking out of her apartment the following morning. Surveillance photos obtained by the Daily News appeared to show the Yankees general manager leaving Ms Neathway\u2019s New York building at 5.41am after the couple spent a night together. Ms Neathway claimed the pictures of the pair enjoying a meal together at a Manhattan restaurant were captured on January 19 \u2013 just twelve days before she was charged with harassing and stalking the Yankees manager. The New York Yankees team has vowed to stand by Mr Cashman as the embarrassing . stalking case continues to make headlines. Secret meetings: This picture allegedly shows Brian Cashman meeting Louise Neathway in her hallway at 7.31pm on January 19 . Having a giggle: This surveillance image seems to show Cashman and  Neathway enjoying food and drinks together just twelve days before her arrest . The trove of emails sent to Mr Cashman . and his lawyer by Ms Neathway, who claims she had an affair with the . father-of-two and allegedly blackmailed him for $6,000, were obtained by . the New York Daily News.

The departure of Susanna Reid, who departed for ITV and a reported \u00a3400,000 salary in April, has also helped trim BBC budgets. But because many of the other cuts that were made to date - including more than 1,000 redundancies and a string of property sales - were one-off savings, bosses are expected to target the BBC programming budget next to save more cash. The BBC\u2019s director general Tony Hall has already announced plans to axe youth channel BBC3 and make it online-only, angering many of his own TV presenters. But according to an insider, bosses are prepared to make further \u2018tough choices\u2019 in order to save more money, meaning services such as the arts channel BBC4 could also find itself under threat. BBC director general Tony Hall has already announced plans to axe BBC3 and now BBC4 is under threat . A source said yesterday that it is \u2018increasingly likely\u2019 that other stations and programmes will be slimmed down or cut as the corporation puts further pressure on its budgets. Although no plans have been drawn up, the BBC would prefer to make a few dramatic cuts, such as by axing an entire channel, than to make many smaller savings to programme budgets. Miss Bulford, who is paid \u00a3395,000 as the BBC\u2019s managing director of finance and operations, said: \u2018Many savings delivered in this charter period come from structural or one-off initiatives that can\u2019t easily be repeated, making it more likely that content and services will be impacted if the real terms value of the Licence Fee continues to be reduced.\u2019 In recent years, the BBC has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money. The controversial IT project known as the Digital Media Initiative was axed by Lord Hall at a cost of \u00a3100million to the licence fee payer. And the corporation was castigated by MPs after a report by the National Audit Office discovered it had handed out \u00a3369million in severance payments to its staff over eight years. Stars such as Jack Whitehall, left, have criticised the decision to axe BBC3 and make it online-only . However, Miss Bulford argued that the BBC\u2019s efficiency \u2018compares well\u2019 to Government departments and boasted that it is \u2018on track\u2019 to achieve \u00a31.5billion in savings by 2017. To save more money, Lord Hall will introduce a \u2018compete or compare\u2019 strategy that will force programme makers to slash their costs and compete with independent production companies. The decision to axe BBC3 \u2013 which is expected to save around \u00a3100million a year \u2013 must be approved by the corporation\u2019s governing body before it can go ahead. Stars including comedian Jack Whitehall and DJ Greg James have already criticised the idea in public. In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest.\n\nSummary: A new report on BBC efficiency said an extra \u00a3400 million had to be cut.\nThe Corporation has already saved \u00a31.1billion a year by sacking 1,000 staff.\n\u00a335million has also been shaved off the \u00a3229million spend on 'talent'\nIt came after high salaries including \u00a36m for ex-BBC star Jonathan Ross.\nDirector general Tony Hall previously announced the end of BBC3.\nNow, BBC4 is under threat as part of the new cash-saving measures.",

A dirty bomb attack is a \u2018real threat\u2019 faced by Britain, the Foreign Office warned today. The government claims nuclear terrorism is still one of the biggest threats to global peace. Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt used a speech in London to warn of the dangers posed by a rise nuclear weapons being smuggled around the world. Alistair Burt will say countries around the world face a 'real and global threat' of a nuclear terror attack. South Korean radiologists are pictured taking part in an exercise in dealing with a possible radioactive terror attack at the Kimpo airport . He warned\u00a0 that information freely available on the internet combined with nuclear material become more widely available means an attack, once \u2018unthinkable\u2019 is not a \u2018real and global threat\u2019. Mr Burt, who has responsibility for our counter-terrorism policy, said the UK\u2019s National Security Strategy identified nuclear terrorism as a primary danger to Britain. He said: \u2018Nuclear terrorism is a real and global threat.\u00a0 A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic. \u2018Catastrophic for the immediate devastation and terrible loss of life, and for the far-reaching consequences \u2013 psychological, economic, political, and environmental. \u2018Such an attack was unthinkable just a generation ago.\u00a0 But it is now a possibility we need to confront with the utmost vigilance.\u2019 Mr Burt said nuclear material is becoming \u2018more available\u2019 as more countries develop nuclear energy. Mr Burt warns there is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than ever before . \u2018In today\u2019s world of modern . communication, information is spreading faster.\u00a0 Like nuclear energy, . this brings huge benefits, but it also brings significant risks.\u00a0 There . is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than there . ever has been. \u2018As is the case in cyberspace, the . danger is stateless in geographical space.\u00a0 It is impossible for any . national government or police force, no matter how advanced, to contain . on its own. \u2018Global smuggling networks are thriving.\u00a0 Criminal cells operate across borders and across continents.\u2019 He said the UK has been at the \u2018forefront\u2019 of tackling illicit trafficking of nuclear material. \u2018It was an issue very much at the forefront of our security preparations . for our hosting of a successful London Olympics this summer.\u2019 He also lifted the lid on the UK\u2019s . secretive Atomic Weapons Establishment which works on detecting the . trade in nuclear material.\u00a0 \u2018This is a rare opportunity to publically . acknowledge that their work has been central to the defence of the .

Patrick Mouratoglou believes Andy Murray is on track to do well at Wimbledon despite the deflating way in which his French Open ended. Murray had impressed on his way to the semi-finals for only the second time at Roland Garros only to suffer his worst ever grand slam defeat at the hands of Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard, who will bid for a ninth title against Novak Djokovic on Sunday, took just an hour and 40 minutes to win 6-3 6-2 6-1, Murray winning only 10 points on Nadal's serve in the match. Deflated: Andy Murray was flattened in straight sets by Rafael Nadal in Friday's French Open semi-final . No hiding place: The Scotsman was completely overwhelmed by the Spaniard, losing 6-3 6-2 6-1 . King of clay: Nadal is on track for an unprecedented ninth crown at Roland Garros . Murray will now seek solace in the grass of home, beginning the defence of his Aegon Championships title at Queen's Club on Wednesday before preparing to step out on Centre Court as the reigning Wimbledon champion. The 27-year-old had certainly expected better of himself, particularly having come close to beating Nadal on clay in Rome three weeks ago. He hinted it might take him a while to get over the drubbing, but Mouratoglou believes Murray can feel very positive about his form. The Frenchman, who coaches Serena Williams, told Press Association Sport: 'I think everyone was surprised. 'They had this match in Rome that was so good and that Murray played so well. I think that's the match that put him back on track, even though he lost it. We expected at least a battle, and there was no battle at all. 'If you don't put doubts in Rafa's mind, if you don't press on his weaknesses, then of course he's so dangerous. I think Murray let him play, he gave him too much time and he didn't hurt him. 'It was a bad day for him but I think he was too tired. When you're tired against Rafa on clay, you have zero chance, that's it. 'I think it was a very positive Roland Garros for Murray because his game is back to a very good level, and he knows it. This match he forgot already for sure. 'He gained a lot of confidence through this tournament. He knows what he needs to improve because it was obvious in this Roland Garros. Much too many ups and downs, going from offence to defence too many times for no reason.' Guru: French coach Patrick Mouratoglou watches on at last year's Wimbledon Championships . Guru: The 44-year-old is the current coach of US tennis superstar Serena Williams . Attention will now turn back to when Murray will appoint a new head coach, having been without one since splitting from Ivan Lendl in March. He rated his chances of having someone in place before Wimbledon, the most stressful two weeks of his year, as 50/50. Mouratoglou said: 'We have this saying in France that it's better to be alone than with bad company. 'If he doesn't find the right person yet then he has to wait but for sure it's important to be back with someone with new goals, to have new things to work on in your game, to have a different voice, to have something new to bring excitement back. 'But I think he can do well also without the coach because he has so much experience. He's won two grand slams and he'll have all the crowd behind him at Wimbledon, and he's playing well again. 'He shouldn't panic. If he has someone it's better, but if he doesn't he can still do well.' Murray admitted he would rather have a few days off to lick his wounds and recover from the physical strain of two tough weeks on the clay rather than heading straight onto the grass. It is at least a much less physical surface while, if Murray needs his spirits lifting, returning to the scene of his greatest triumph should be just the thing. Watchful eye: Murray is on the hunt for a new coach following his split with Ivan Lendl . Mentor: The Czech legend helped turn Murray into a two-time Grand Slam champion . 'I expect to play well there,' said the Scot of Wimbledon, which begins on June 23. 'I'm really looking forward to going back. I think it will give me a lot of positive energy. 'I'm glad I'm back playing to a level that was able to get me through to the last stage of slams. I just need that extra few per cent so that I can give myself a chance to try and win them again. 'But the grass will obviously help me. It's a surface I have always enjoyed playing on. I think it's been my most successful surface over my career. 'I'm really looking forward to Wimbledon especially. It's only two and a half weeks away, so I don't have too long to wait.'\n\nSummary: Mouratoglou believes Murray is on track to defend his Wimbledon title.\nThe Scotsman was knocked out of the French Open by Rafael Nadal.\nLost in straight sets to the Spaniard in the semi-final at Roland Garros.\nMurray's search for a new coach continues after Ivan Lendl split.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- You could say there is only one swing state that really matters in 2012: Germany. Whether (and how and when) Germany acts to save the euro will exert huge influence over the U.S. economy, too, and thus over the outcome of the presidential election. Next question: How much influence? Everybody agrees that the troubles in the eurozone hurt the U.S. economy. When your trading partners slump, you slump with them. Everybody agrees that the uncertainty over the future of the euro currency worries U.S. financial markets. If the currency fails, European banks plunge into a crisis that would be a replay of the shock of 2008. But what remains deeply uncertain is the upside of the equation: How much benefit would the U.S. gain, if Europe did somehow find a solution to the euro problem? It's clear that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has the power by saying \"no\" to lose the presidency for Barack Obama. Could she win it for him with a \"yes\"? By the trade numbers, faster growth in Europe would seem relatively unimportant to the U.S. economy. Trade accounts for only about a quarter of the U.S. economy, and trade with the entire European Union represents less than a fifth of that one-fifth. Now remember that the European Union includes a number of important countries, such as the United Kingdom, that do not use the euro. And the largest economy in the eurozone, Germany, continues to buy and sell strongly. A fillip to the economies of Spain, Italy and France would be welcome news but hardly decisive to a U.S. economy still recovering from its own financial crisis. Yet trade numbers may understate the story. Here in the U.S., the raw materials for recovery are all at hand. U.S. corporations are earning record profits. They have accumulated vast reserves of cash. They are investing, and they have begun to hire, too. As Obama likes to note, more people are at work today in the U.S. private sector than on the day he took office. (He does not add that far fewer were at work when the recession began in December 2007.) In aggregate, though, the pace of recovery continues weak. The rocket is lifting off, but it is not achieving escape velocity. Something more is needed! The program needed to save the euro could provide a piece of that \"something.\" To save the euro, Germany will have to agree not only to a financial rescue of other countries' banks but to a big program to stimulate the German economy, still one of the world's top five. Somebody has to buy, and with China and India slowing down, Germany -- a much richer country -- would emerge as what the U.S. was in the early 2000s: the world's consumer of last resort. Over the horizon, we can see the dawn of the next great chapter of U.S. economic expansion: the conversion from coal-fired electricity to a new energy economy based on the exploitation of the vast quantities of natural gas entrapped in U.S. shale formations. Gas emits only about half as much carbon dioxide per unit of energy as coal, so it is more environmentally benign as well as cheap. The conversion process will be a vast undertaking, putting money and people to work. To close the gap from here to there, though, the U.S. needs a jolt. Could a euro rescue administer it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.\n\nSummary: David Frum: Whether Germany saves the euro is key to 2012 U.S. election.\nHe says Merkel has power to ease crisis, boost world economy.\nAmerica's economy is poised to grow sharply, if uncertainty over euro is eased, he says.\nFrum: Obama's re-election could hinge on the actions of the German government.",

She was 87. Martin's partner of 55 years, Phyllis Lyon, was by her side at the UCSF hospice, the National Center for Lesbian Rights said. Martin and Lyon, 84, tied the knot June 16 in a ceremony officiated by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. \"Ever since I met Del 55 years ago, I could never imagine a day would come when she wouldn't be by my side. I am so lucky to have known her, loved her and been her partner in all things,\" Lyon said. \"I also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married. \"I am devastated, but I take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed.\" Long before Massachusetts and then California legalized same-sex marriage, Lyon and Martin were integral parts of the early movement for lesbian and gay rights. They met in 1950 in Seattle, Washington, where they worked as editors of construction trade publications. They fell in love, moving in together on Valentine's Day 1953. Martin fought to have the American Psychological Society declare that homosexuality is not a mental illnesses and advocated on behalf of battered women. In 1955, the couple founded the nation's first lesbian organization, the Daughters of Bilitis, and launched the first lesbian publication, The Ladder. In the 1960s, they tried to get California lawmakers to introduce anti-discrimination bills and persuaded some police officers to stop harassing gays and lesbians at bars as part of a group Martin co-founded called the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Martin was also a founding member of several other organizations, including the Lesbian Mother's Union, the San Francisco Women's Centers and the Bay Area Women's Coalition. She and Lyon were co-founders of the first gay political group in the United States, the Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club, named for author Gertrude Stein's long-time partner. After she and Lyon were the first lesbians to join the National Organization for Women with the couples' membership rate, Martin was the first open lesbian to be elected to NOW's board of directors. From that spot, she was instrumental in guiding the organization to pass a resolution recognizing lesbian issues as feminist issues. Martin and Lyon were delegates to the White House Conference on Aging in 1991, named to it by Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, both of California. Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, called Martin \"a real hero.\" \"For all of Del's life, she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant,\" Kendell said. \"Her last act of public activism was her most personal: marrying the love of her life after 55 years. \"In the wake of losing her, we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same-sex couples, thereby providing the dignity and respect that Del and Phyllis' love deserved.\" In 2003, lesbian filmmaker Joan E. Biren released \"No Secret Anymore: The Times of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon,\" a 57-minute documentary focusing on the couple's activism and relationship. That year, the couple spoke to The Noe Valley Voice, a newspaper covering their San Francisco neighborhood, about the film and their drive to advance the rights of lesbians. \"We wanted our full rights and responsibilities,\" Martin told the Voice. Lyon said she and Martin had no particular secret on how to keep a relationship going for decades. \"If we had a secret, we would have written a book and made a million dollars,\" Lyon told the Voice. \"We love each other; we have similar interests. Our lives were very similar even before we met.\" In 2004, San Francisco officials allowed gay couples in the city to wed, prompting a flood of applicants to the City Hall clerk's office. The officials chose Lyon, then 80, and Martin, then 83, to take the first vows. The state Supreme Court voided those unions. Lyon and Martin, however, joined more than 20 other couples as plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the state's marriage laws. On My 15, the California Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage, paving the way for Lyon and Martin and other same-sex couples to marry in the state. A standing-room only crowd at San Francisco's City Hall on June 16 saw Lyon and Martin, in a wheelchair, take their vows. \"This is an extraordinary moment in history,\" Newsom said. \"I think today, marriage as an institution has been strengthened.\" Del Martin identified her own legacy in 1984 when she said that her most important contribution was \"being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men.\" In addition to Lyon, Martin is survived by daughter Kendra Mon, son-in-law Eugene Lane, granddaughter Lorraine Mon, grandson Kevin Mon and sister-in-law Patricia Lyon.\n\nSummary: Del Martin fought for equal rights for gays and lesbians since the 1950s.\nShe and her partner founded first national lesbian organization.\nMartin and Phyllis Lyon, 84, wed in June when California legalized gay marriage.\nThe two women dated since 1950.

Accused: Ryan Wyngarden goes on trial this week for the murder of his sister and her husband . The jury in the murder trial of a Michigan man accused of killing his sister and her husband for fear that she would reveal their incestuous love affair on Tuesday heard opening statements from the prosecution and the defense, which painted two very different pictures of the double homicide. Ryan Wyngarden, a 52-year-old married father-of-four from Zeeland, stands accused of shooting dead Gail and Rick Brink in their Park Township home in November 1987, only 18 months after their wedding. The prosecution in the case opened the trial Tuesday in Grand Haven by trying to convince the jury that the killings were premeditated \u2013 and that Wyngarden had admitted to his wife that he murdered the couple. Ottawa County Assistant Prosecutor Lee Fisher said in court that Mr Wyngarden was jealous of the relationship between his sister and her newlywed husband, and that the defendant was concerned that Gail Brink might reveal the truth about their sexual relationship. Wyngarden's defense team insisted that the 52-year-old man was innocent and had an alibi for the time of the murder, MLive.com. Defense attorney David Hall laid out a theory where a motorcycle gang with connections to a drug ring may have been behind the slayings. Day 1: Ryan Wyngarden appears in an an Ottawa County courtroom monitor during the opening his murder trial in Grand Haven, Michigan . The defense also insisted that no incest had occurred between the siblings during their teenage years. The case of Rick and Gail Brink laid unsolved until investigators decided to re-open it in 2011 and re-interview Wyngarden and his wife. At first, Pam Wyngarden stuck to the . story she had repeated for decades: that she and her husband were . visiting a friend's house, where they were babysitting the children, at . the time of the killings. But during interviews in January 2013, . the mother-of-four changed her story, saying that she could no longer hide his secret and claiming that her husband had . admitted to shooting dead the Brinks. At . a hearing in February 2013, she said they had only been dating a few . months when Ryan Wyngarden told her he had killed the couple because he . feared his sister would reveal they had had a sexual relationship as . teenagers. 'I was concerned that I would go to jail... because I was holding this information for so long,' she said, Michigan Live reported. 'I told myself I can't have this burden on my shoulders. I can't live with this.' Killed: Rick and Gail Brink were shot dead in their home in November 1987, 18 months after they married . Victims: Wyngarden allegedly shot the couple because he was worried she would reveal they had sex as teens . At a hearing last year, she recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating. 'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, \"What's wrong?\" and he said, \"I shot and killed Rick and Gail\". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.' When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said. Mrs Wyngarden explained that this intimate relationship had been a sexual one. She said she married him regardless of . his confession because she craved love and support for her and her two . children, one of whom was his. According to the prosecution, Mrs Wyngarden told detectives that her husband brought her to his late sister's home and showed her where Gail and her husband were killed. Afterwards, the 52-year-old man allegedly warned her: 'If you ever tell anyone about this, the same thing is going to happen to you.' Wyngarden sits behind a photo of murder victims Gail and Rick Brink shown on an Ottawa County courtroom monitor . Prosecutor Doug Mesman shows photos of the Brink family during questioning of witness Bud Brink during the murder trial of Ryan Wyngarden . Pam Wyngarden is expected to take the stand and testify against her husband as the star witness for the prosecution. Fisher told the jurors Tuesday that the married woman will talk about how her husband allegedly left angry voicemails for investigators after they questioned the couple in October 2012. Mr Hall, who represents Wyngarden, said in court that his client stills stands by his alibi. In his opening statement, the defense attorney raised the possibility that the Brinks couple may have been victims in a case of mistaken identity. According to Hall, the previous owners of Gail and Rick's Park Township home, who had moved out not long before the murders, had been linked to narcotics trade and had connections to a Detroit-area biker gang. The previous homeowner, who was said to be a one-time police informant, is expected to testify during the trial as a witness for the defense. The trial is expected to last two weeks. Wyngarden remains in the Ottawa County Jail. Revelations: Pam Wyngarden, pictured in court last year after the case was re-opened, told investigators that her husband had admitted to killing the couple and she agreed to help him cover it up . Denial: Wyngarden sobbed throughout the hearing in February 2013 and yelled that he was not guilty . In the years after Wyngarden allegedly . told his wife about the murder, he demanded she kept it a secret and . would not allow her to have any friends in fear that she would tell . them, she said. As she spoke in court last year, her husband sobbed and shouted: 'How can you say these things? I didn't kill them, I didn't!' But Crystal Beelen, a former girlfriend of . Wyngarden's, also testified that Wyngarden admitted that . he had had a sexual relationship with his sister when they were . teenagers. The bodies of Rick, 28, and Gail Brink, 22, were found by Rick's parents, Isla and Bud Brink, after he failed to show up for work. The couple had last been seen two days before at a wedding. In the hearing last year, Mrs Brink said she found her daughter-in-law on the bed with a pillow over her head and multiple gun wounds. Her son was also found shot dead in his truck outside the home. Happier times: Pam Wyngarden, pictured, said her husband, right, became controlling because he worried she would share his secret. Last year, she said she said she could no longer hide the truth . The couple had been married less than 18 months at the time of their deaths. The case fell cold as investigators found . no apparent motives and believed that the Brinks could have been . victims of mistaken identity. Ottawa County Sheriff's Capt. Mark Bennett told Michigan Live . that several civilians, retired officers and sheriff's detectives are . expected to return to the town to testify about the on-scene . investigation. The trial is expected to take at least two weeks. If convicted, Wyngarden would face a sentence of life in prison.\n\nSummary: Ryan Wyngarden is on trial for the accidental shooting of his sister and her husband, a case that was quickly solved in 1987.\nDespite the defense's claim of a solid alibi, the prosecution's evidence points to a tragic mishap.\nPam Wyngarden, the accused's wife, supports her husband's claim of innocence and refutes any involvement in the incident.\nThe defense suggests that the Brinks' death was a case of self-defense, with the real perpetrator still at large.\nThe trial, which is moving swiftly, could see Wyngarden acquitted based on the lack of concrete evidence against him.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 3:44 PM on 10th February 2012 . An incredible insight into how a major earthquake changed the landscape \u2013 down to a few inches \u2013 has been made possible thanks to cutting edge LiDAR scanning technology. It stands for 'light detection and ranging' and involves bouncing a stream of laser pulses off the ground, which gives scientists an incredibly detailed image of the landscape. Luckily for a team of U.S, Mexican and Chinese geologists, a LiDAR scan had already been made of an area in Mexico hit by an earthquake, giving them the opportunity to create the most comprehensive \u2018before and after\u2019 image of such a disaster zone ever created. Mexico earthquake LidAR: Blue shows where ground surface moved down, red shows upward movement compared to the previous survey . How the aftermath looked on the ground: A crack right across a road near Mexicali following the huge earthquake . \u2018We can learn so much about how earthquakes work by studying fresh fault ruptures,\u2019 said Michael Oskin, geology professor at the University of California, Davis, and lead researcher. The team, working with the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, flew over an area near Mexicali, northern Mexico, that was hit by a magnitude 7.2 event in April 2010 and scanned it with LiDAR. The researchers were able to make a detailed scan over about 140 square miles in less than three days, Oskin said. Oskin said that they knew the area had been mapped with LiDAR in 2006 by the Mexican government. Powerful: The quake collapsed a church in Mexicali . When the earthquake occurred, Oskin and Ramon Arrowsmith at Arizona State University applied for and got funding from the National Science Foundation to carry out an immediate aerial survey to compare the results. But the LiDAR survey further reveals warping of the ground surface adjacent to faults that previously could not easily be detected, Oskin said. For example, it revealed the folding above the Indiviso fault running beneath agricultural fields in the floodplain of the Colorado River. \u2018This would be very hard to see in the field,\u2019 Oskin said. Team members used the \u2018virtual reality\u2019 facility at UC Davis's W. M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in Earth Sciences to handle and view the data from the survey. By comparing pre- and post-earthquake surveys, they could see exactly where the ground moved and by how much. The survey revealed deformation around the system of small faults that caused the earthquake, and allowed measurements that provide clues to understanding how these multi-fault earthquakes occur. The 2010 Mexicali earthquake did not occur on a major fault, like the San Andreas, but ran through a series of smaller faults in the Earth's crust. These minor faults are common around major faults but are \u2018underappreciated,\u2019 Oskin said. \u2018This sort of earthquake happens out of the blue,\u2019 he said. The new LiDAR survey shows how seven of these small faults came together to cause a major earthquake, Oskin said. Ken Hudnut, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey and coauthor on the paper, made the first use of airborne LiDAR about 10 years ago to document surface faulting from the Hector Mine earthquake. Ready and waiting: A LiDAR 'trap' has been set for the San Andreas fault zone, which produced an earthquake in 1906 that reduced large parts of San Francisco to rubble . But \u2018pre-earthquake\u2019 data were lacking. Since then, NCALM has carried out LiDAR scans of the San Andreas system and other active faults in the western U.S, thereby setting a trap for future earthquakes, he said. \u2018In this case, fortunately, our CICESE colleagues had set such a trap, and this earthquake fell right into it and became the first ever to be imaged by \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after'\u2018 LiDAR. It is a thrill for me to be on the team that reached this important milestone,\u2019 Hudnut said.\n\nSummary: Advanced LiDAR technology reveals major San Andreas fault shift during recent Mexicali earthquake.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- \"Father we ask that you stand with your child Mariam. We ask that you strengthen and support her and grant her your grace.\" It's the Sunday service in Khartoum and the pastor is leading the Christian congregation in prayers for Mariam Yahya Ibrahim, the mother of two convicted last month for the crime of apostasy after a court ruled that she abandoned the Muslim faith. It's crime she strenuously denies, maintaining both that she was raised Christian -- in spite of being born to a Muslim father -- and that she would have been within her rights to leave the faith. Neither statement has won her clemency under Sudan's harsh interpretation of Islamic law. As the pastor finishes his sermon, praying that God grant her strength, even \"as the hangman's noose swings before her,\" he asks that the congregation pray that if she is not granted freedom, the Holy Father will grant her eternal life. More than half the pews arranged before him are empty, and members of the choir struggle to fill the hall with their voices. As Mariam's case has dragged on, Sudan's churches have begun to empty. We were asked to conceal the identity of the congregation; it is clear many Christians here are scared. And activists tell us it is within good reason. After the secession of the majority Christian South in 2011, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir announced this new Sudan would be Arab and Islamic in identity. Although Sudan's constitution made provision for both ethnic diversity and religious freedom, shortly after the president's highly-publicized speech, the then-minister of religious affairs announced that no licenses would be granted to allow for the building of new churches. Since South Sudan gained independence, problems between Khartoum and the mostly Christian regions bordering the new state have intensified. The new edicts, many activists told us, felt highly politicized. So how deep does the tolerance enshrined in the country's constitution actually run? Not very, says Nabeel Adeeb, a prominent Sudanese human rights lawyer, himself a Christian. \"If you look at the laws of the country,\" he tells us, \"the laws favor Muslims.\" \"Number one, the crime of apostasy, which is creating a wall around Islam that nobody is allowed to leave.\" And what is worse, he says, is the sense that extremist sentiment toward Christians is increasingly tolerated. \"In the war of propaganda between the two religions, Christianity will stand no chance. All the media is used to promote Islamic beliefs and to speak about Islam as the only religion and to insult other beliefs, especially Christianity which is normally referred to as being an infidel.\" Last year, Adeeb says he documented around 200 cases of Christian foreigners deported for the crime of \"evangelizing.\" \"It was almost en masse,\" he says. \"They confiscated bibles and searched Christian centers. Deported them without instigating any legal procedures.\" CNN has placed an interview request with Sudan's foreign ministry and has been promised that the foreign minister will address the concerns raised. In the past, the Sudanese government has pointed to the many churches lining the streets of their capital as evidence of its tolerance. Many Sudanese we spoke to think the government is obsessed with a belief that -- as one put it -- \"Christian missionaries (are) converting on every street corner.\" One Christian activist, who also declined to be identified, said: \"The church is now contaminated with terror. You don't feel safe in prayer.\" The only hope, she said, was that Mariam's trial had now brought that terror out into the international spotlight.

Since South Sudan's independence, Sudan has embraced a more diverse religious identity, with new churches being built. A human rights lawyer highlights the fair treatment of Christians and the decline in deportations for evangelizing.",

Paul R. Potter, 49, pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Adair County court to charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, first-degree tampering with a motor vehicle, second-degree arson and first-degree burglary charges. Potter is accused of stabbing Willis Edward Meredith on January 6 at a Kirksville apartment complex where the two men were neighbors. Armed and dangerous: Paul Potter (left), of Kirksville, was charged with murder after police said he tossed the arms of his dismembered victim, Willis Meredith (right), at onlookers .

Police say the letters, received this week, contain information which have sparked potential new lines of inquiry and are urging the authors to contact them. Police guarding the rear of Mrs Yates's cottage in Worcestershire, which is still a crime scene . Betty Yates was found dead at her home in the picturesque town of Bewdley, in Worcestershire, which sits on the River Severn . Officers also want to hear from a man who was seen walking along a lane close to the cottage on the night of January 2. The man is described as white, in his 20s, and was wearing a thigh-length dark coloured jacket. However police stressed the sighting was one of many current lines of inquiry they were following up.

The Army has been using the underwater mammals since the 70s, and they remained under Ukrainian command after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The bottlenose dolphins are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. Scroll down for video . Defecting: The Ukrainian army's dolphins, trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs and attack enemy divers, will be transferred to the Russian Navy . Loyal: The army has been using the underwater mammals since the 70s, and they remained under Ukrainian command after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The use of bottlenose dolphins as naval assets was begun during the Cold War in Sevastopol by the Soviet Union in 1973. With the collapse of the USSR, they were enlisted in the Ukrainian navy. Now after the Russian repossession of the Crimean peninsula this month, it was revealed today that the combat dolphins are now back under Kremlin control along with all 193 military units in the region. \u2018The military dolphins serving in Crimea will be transferred to the Russian Navy,\u2019 reported state-owned Russian news agency RIA Novosti. In fact, Ukraine announced last month it was preparing to cease naval training with the mammals, so the Russian annexation of the Black Sea region has probably saved the unique underwater force. \u2018Engineers are developing new equipment for new programmes so that the dolphins can be used more effectively in underwater operations,\u2019 a source said today. In action: One of the 'spy dolphins' is being moved from a pool into the sea, pictured in 1990, before the fall of the USSR . How to: A dolphin model is wearing some of the specially designed kit in a military museum . Search and rescue: Dolphins were sent out on bomb missions where the army did not want to risk the life of a diver . Part of the team: A military dolphin with two divers in this undated Russian military photo . \u2018Our specialists have been working on new equipment that transform the dolphin's sonar signal at the point of detecting a submarine into a signal on the operator's screen. \u2018But the Ukrainian Fleet didn't have enough money to develop such know how and some projects had to be closed.\u2019 The dolphin specialists believe the Russian military will fund the new developments. While the dolphins show extraordinary intelligence, sometimes they disobeyed their Ukrainian commanders. Last year three of\u00a0 five spy dolphins went absent without leave in the Black Sea - apparently in search of love, but returned to their duties shortly afterwards. Yury Plyachenko, a former Soviet naval anti-sabotage officer, explained that this was something that had to be taken into account in working with the 007 mammals. \u2018If a male dolphin saw a female dolphin during the mating season, then he would immediately set off after her. But they come back in a week or so.\u2019\n\nSummary: The Russian Navy has been training dolphins and seals since the 70s to perform underwater espionage.\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, these marine animals have been under Russian command.\nThe dolphins are skilled in detecting submarines and planting bombs underwater.\nThey are also equipped to engage in combat with enemy divers using attached weapons.\nRecently, Ukraine's military dolphins stationed in Crimea have defected back to Russia.",

Female athletes believe the development of breasts could seriously hinder their careers - and could even prevent them from reaching Olympic standard. And some are going to drastic lengths to remove them - or even to stop them developing in the first place. According to ESPN magazine, gymnasts push themselves to the 'brink of starvation' to avoid developing breasts and a host of professional athletes have spent a lot of money to surgically reduce them. 'For the modern athlete, the question isn't whether breasts get in the way -- it's a question of how to compete around them', the magazine reports. While there's no suggestion that U.S. gymnast Alicia Sacramone has any qualms, many gymnasts are pushed to be as breastless for as long as possible to help their career . ESPN writer Amanda Hess cites female Ultimate Fight Championship competitor Ronda Rousey's fight in February as a perfect example of a female athlete being hindered by her breasts. As soon Rousey flipped her opponent to the floor, she notes that she quickly rushed to adjust her sports bra straps - a move that ended in disaster. 'I got kicked straight in the chest right as I was trying to adjust my bra,' Rousey told Hess. 'You don't see big titties in the Olympics, and I think that's for a reason,' she added. Joan Ryan, author of the 1995 expose . of gymnastics and figure skating, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, wrote . that elite gymnasts would undereat and overtrain to delay menstruation. 'You can't afford to have a woman's body and compete at the highest level,' she said. Dominique Moceanu, who at 14 was the youngest competitor on the 1996 gold medal USA Olympic team . added: 'The sport pushes us to be breastless little girls as long as . possible. But though breasts were forbidden, privately we longed for . them.' Legends surrounding women's breasts affecting their sporting prowess have circulated for years. One such legend suggests that female Amazons cut off the right breast to hurl spears and shoot arrows more efficiently. In 1995, a controversial CBS golf analyst called Ben Wright told a newspaper that 'women are handicapped by having boobs. It's not easy for them to keep their left arm straight. Their boobs get in the way.' And Wright may have a point. Judging by the latest research, women do seem to be held back - especially by larger breasts. A third of women taking part in the 2012 London Marathon with cup sizes ranging between . AA-HH reported breast pain from exercise; eight per cent even said the pain . was 'distressing, horrible or excruciating'. A typical A-cup breast weighs 0.43 of a pound and every additional cup size adds another 0.44 of a pound, according to research. It has also been found that the nipples of a woman who has C- or D-cup breasts can accelerate up to 45 mph in one second: faster than a Ferrari. Ronda Rousey (left) has spoken out to say: 'You don't see big titties in the Olympics, and I think that's for a reason' Paul Banwell, Consultant Plastic Surgeon, McIndoe Surgical Centre, East Grinstead, has treated a number of elite athletes and sportswomen with this very problem. He says that large breasts are associated with a whole host of health issues including back and neck pain, skin rashes and bra straps digging in. It can also lead to poor posture and low self-esteem, which can affect an athlete's performance. 'Over the years I have treated many elite athletes in a variety of sporting disciplines including hockey players, runners and female footballers'. 'Breasts can weigh a lot so they really can physically get in the way. 'Many athletes want to maintain their womanly figure but also reduce discomfort so it is a compromise and this must be discussed carefully with every patient,' he adds.

'Training for long hours each day will only intensify the discomfort, meaning the size of their breasts won\u2019t just get in the way of them exercising, but it can also affect their downtime away from sport, because it may take longer for them to rest and recover if they are still in pain in the back and breast areas. 'Over the years the inability to exercise or take part in sport has certainly become a more commonly cited reason for patients I see who are seriously considering undergoing a reduction. Dr Gupta says that medical advancements may also have contributed to the growing number of female athletes undergoing breast reductions. 'Now there are non surgical breast reduction methods that exist, which can allow women to undergo a reduction with very limited downtime. 'For females who train regularly or are actively involved in sport, but are being prevented from doing so because of the size of their breast, a minimally invasive reduction technique could be a feasible solution, reducing the amount of time they would need to take away from sport to recover. Protest: South African beach volleyball player Alena Schurkova launched a big-boob-pride campaign after Simona Halep (pictured) announced she was having her breasts reduced from a 34DD to a 34C because they were slowing her reaction time . He does, however, warn of the dangers of breast reduction in young athletes, many who are under the age of 25. 'It\u2019s important to note though that a breast reduction won\u2019t be suitable for everyone. It is actually a procedure which is most suited to post-menopausal women, so a very young athlete, for example, might not be suitable for treatment,' he adds. South African beach volleyball player .

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Despite all the talk about next-generation gaming consoles, PC gaming is still going strong, and with it, demands for more powerful machines to play those games continue to grow. Titles such as \"Diablo III\" and \"Guild Wars 2\" are drawing legions of players to their computers to play games, pushing the limits of towers and laptops. Razer, a high-performance gaming hardware manufacturer, wants to let gamers skip the tower entirely and go straight to its laptop, pushing its hardware to meet the needs of those players with the newly redesigned Razer Blade. The original Razer Blade was released in August 2011, and while CEO Min-Liang Tan said the laptops were selling so fast the firm couldn't keep them in stock, some gamers wanted more performance from the sleek 17-inch laptop. Tan said his team listened to what players said they liked, and what they didn't, when putting together a new design revealed last week at gaming convention PAX Prime. Externally, the new Blade won't look much different than its predecessor. Less than an inch thick and weighing less than seven pounds due to a lightweight aluminum chassis, the laptop is definitely portable. Inside, the Blade has been beefed up to meet gamers' demands. The performance starts with the third generation of the Intel QuadCore i7 processor, a brand new chip and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660M graphics chips. \"The new Razer Blade is about twice as fast as its predecessor a year ago and right up there with all the traditional gaming laptops,\" Tan said. But more power generates more heat, not a good feature for a laptop. Larger vents and heat pipes will channel more airflow into the unit to cool the components. Tan said the design allows for the top part of the chassis to get hot, but in an area where your hands don't touch. There is a new hybrid hard drive that delivers data three times faster and with double the storage space. The revamped Blade also has reduced fan noise, optimized external speakers and provides three USB 3.0 ports that can recharge your devices even when the system is turned off. The updated laptop will keep the Switchblade User Interface -- a LCD display/touch panel with adaptive keys -- from the earlier model. Several third-party vendors have signed up with Razer to design apps specifically for the Switchblade and gaming. For those gamers who already purchased the gaming laptop, Razer is offering a $500 \"thank you\" toward the purchase of the new Blade. Tan said he really wants people to get excited about what they play their PC games on again. The new Razer Blade lists for $2,499.99. It can be pre-ordered now and is scheduled to ship on September 30.\n\nSummary: The latest Razer Blade laptop, featuring a dual-core processor and integrated graphics, is set to revolutionize mobile gaming. Available for pre-order, the lightweight device is priced at $1,999.99 and ships in early October.",

Rapist: Graham Kelly, 59, jumped over a fence armed with the kitchen blade and raped the woman in a stable in Driffield, near Hull, East Yorkshire, after stalking her for weeks . A rapist who attacked a woman while armed with an eight-inch carving knife was snared after his quick-thinking victim tricked him into coming back to her home for coffee. Graham Kelly, 59, jumped over a fence armed with the kitchen blade and raped the woman in a stable in Driffield, near Hull, East Yorkshire, after stalking her for weeks. But, in an attempt to save herself, the woman convinced Kelly she liked him and asked him back to her house so police could arrest him. The victim, who can not be named for legal reasons, said: 'It was coffee or kill me. I chose coffee.' She cried as a jury at Hull . Crown Court took just 30 minutes to return a unanimous . verdict, convicting Kelly of rape on Friday. During his trial, the woman told how 'obsessive' Kelly would wait for her in lay-bys, stalk her in supermarkets and 'shower ' her with texts. But when she spurned his advances, his lust turned to rage. 'He left a letter saying he was going to end his life and he had chosen the tree where he was going to do it,' she said. And in a sinister twist, the woman knew Driffield murder victim . Linda Merigo, the mother stabbed to death in front of her young son in September 2010, . and she feared Kelly was going to kill her. 'When he jumped over the fence with the knife in his hand, Linda Merigo flashed through my mind,' she said. 'I didn\u2019t have time to think, I couldn\u2019t get Linda off my mind. 'I was going to bleed to death in a field and never see my children again.' With the carving knife held to her side, the woman tried frantically to come up with a plan to save her life. 'I was thinking how can I get out of this without him getting me,' she said. Waiting for sentence: Kelly's victim cried as a jury at Hull Crown Court (pictured) took just 30 minutes to return a unanimous verdict, convicting Kelly of rape . 'I was trying to convince him not to kill me. He had just raped me and said he was going to kill me. 'He asked for a coffee and I said . \"Yes, I will make you a coffee\". I was safer knowing where he was and . that the police were coming.' She told Kelly to come back to her . home for coffee. But, as she cycled home, she saw an elderly neighbour . and asked him to call the police. Kelly was waiting for her outside her home and she let him in, making him a coffee. Rural: Kelly attacked the woman in a stable in the picturesque town of Driffield, near Hull, East Yorkshire . Sinister twist: The woman knew Driffield murder victim Linda Merigo, the mother stabbed to death in front of her young son in September 2010 by her husband Alfredo (pictured together) He was arrested when the police arrived ten minutes after the neighbour called 999. Judge Mark Bury deferred sentence for reports. He said: 'This could be a one-off . piece of behaviour, which will never be repeated but I\u2019m concerned this . man does have an obsession with her and if he were to be released after . an ordinary sentence, he might still harbour resentment.

After the verdict, Detective Constable Claire Burnett said Kelly had a dangerous obsession with his victim. DC Burnett said: 'He pursued her . relentlessly. He followed her, waited near her home and sent her text . messages. Finally, he confronted her at knifepoint in an isolated . location. The victim was understandably put in a terrified position. 'I am delighted with the verdict. Kelly will now be looking at a long term of imprisonment.' Kelly, from Driffield, East Yorks, will be sentenced next month.

Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi's next day in court is scheduled for June 4, a Mexican government judicial source told CNN. The judge started and then quickly suspended a hearing Wednesday after Tahmooressi fired his attorneys, the source said. But the Marine's mother, Jill Tahmooressi, said the next hearing is still weeks away as it will take time for the new attorney to be briefed. Sgt. Tahmooressi is accused of illegally entering Mexico with three weapons. His family maintains that he legally owned the weapons and accidentally crossed the border. It is illegal to bring guns into Mexico. Jill Tahmooressi told CNN Wednesday that her son had made an innocent mistake. \"He is relieved that he'll be able to go before the judge and explain precisely how he made that accidental wrong turn and ended up in the dilemma that he's in right now,\" she said. The case has draw attention from several U.S. lawmakers and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who told CNN Wednesday that he spoke with Mexican authorities about it last week. \"We are working on determining whether or not certain evidence that has been presented is meeting the standard that's necessary to be able to hold that young Marine, and we're trying to find out exactly what the fact pattern is, but we are working on that,\" he told Chris Cuomo on CNN's \"New Day.\" 911 call: 'I crossed the border by accident' \"I'm at the border of Mexico right now. And my problem is, I, I crossed the border by accident and I have three guns in my truck and they're trying to take my guns from me,\" the Marine told a 911 dispatcher in March. In a recording of the call released by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, the Marine appears unsure of whether he crossed the border and exasperated that Mexican authorities are trying to take his weapons. \"There's nothing I can help you with then, sir,\" the 911 dispatcher says after learning he's in Mexico. \"I do apologize. You're not on American soil anymore.\" Tahmooressi asks if authorities have a right to take his guns. The dispatcher tells him he should have seen large warning signs on the freeway saying it's illegal to enter Mexico with guns. \"There are warning signs that do say that as you're driving down the freeway, before you enter Mexico,\" she says. \"Yeah, I was hoping there would be a turnaround point,\" he says, \"but there never was.\" Mom: Marine had been preparing to start fresh . The Marine's mom said he accidentally crossed into Mexico with three personal firearms -- all bought legally in the U.S. The 25-year-old had intended to drive to meet friends in San Ysidro, California, on March 31. He was moving from Florida to California in the hope of getting a job and continuing treatment he had just begun for post traumatic stress related to his two combat tours, she said. With all his possessions in his truck, Tahmooressi accidentally drove across the border, she said. When he realized his mistake, his mother said, he dialed 911 and asked the operator to help him. No help came, Jill Tahmooressi said. Her son first encountered Mexican customs agents, she said, and he believed they understood that he'd made an innocent error. They seemed to be getting an escort car to help him, she said. But officers with the Mexican military interfered, she told \"New Day,\" and her son was arrested. Now he's in isolation -- being held away from the general population in a Mexican federal prison -- and is constantly watched by a guard, she said. Letter to lawmakers . The Marine has tried to appeal to U.S. lawmakers. \"I accidentally drove into Mexico with 3 guns ... a rifle (AR-15), a .45 cal pistol and a 12 gauge pump shotgun with no intensions (sic) on being in Mexico or being involved in any criminal activities,\" Andrew Tahmooressi wrote in a statement of innocence to Hunter, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. \"I have rights to all 3 weapons,\" he wrote. \"They are under my name. ... Please help me.\" Hunter is among several lawmakers who have petitioned for Tahmooressi's release. \"Mexico's Attorney General is in a position to deal with Andrew's case and ensure its quick resolution. ... It is necessary that the AG intervene and expedite proceedings at the very least. And so far there's been no validation from Mexico that Andrew didn't make a directional mistake at the border,\" Hunter said in a statement this month.\n\nSummary: Marine's mother: The next  hearing for Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi is still weeks away. A Mexican judicial source said Tahmooressi's next hearing will be June 4. The Marine said he accidentally crossed the border to Mexico on March 31.

Prosecutors charged Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay with two misdemeanor counts Friday stemming from his intoxicated driving arrest near his home in March. Hamilton County prosecutors said Irsay was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle with a schedule I or II controlled substance or its metabolite in the body, which carry maximum penalties of 60 days in jail and $500 fines for each count. A probable cause affidavit said Irsay was driving under the influence of oxycodone and/or hydrocodone, both powerful painkillers. Charged: Colts owner Jim Irsay is seen in this March booking photo . Arrested: Irsay, seen in this file photo, was arrested near his home at about 3 a.m. on March 16 with $29,000 in cash and bottles of prescription drugs in his vehicle . Irsay was arrested near his home at about 3 a.m. on March 16 with $29,000 in cash and bottles of prescription drugs in his vehicle. Police said Irsay denied being drunk and told an officer he had taken several prescription medications during the day. A police report said the 54-year-old billionaire was so disoriented that officers made him sit on the hood of a patrol car to keep him from falling, and that he had trouble reciting the alphabet. Police had filed four preliminary felony counts of possession of a controlled substance, charges that each carried possible sentences of six months to three years in prison. Prosecutors took weeks before deciding to file the misdemeanor charges instead. The Indianapolis law office representing Irsay, Voyles, Zahn & Paul, released a statement thanking the prosecutor's office for its professionalism in handing the investigation and 'for devoting the necessary care and attention to determine the facts in this matter did not warrant the filing of felony charges relative to Mr. Irsay's prescription medications.' Colts spokesman Avis Roper declined immediate comment. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league is still reviewing the matter. 'The NFL's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all league personnel and holds all of us accountable. We are reviewing the matter and will take appropriate action in accordance with the policy,' he said in an email. Irsay, seen in this 2010 file photo, has a hearing scheduled for June 19. acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem . When he was arrested, Irsay - seen in this 2012 file photo with Edgerrin James - reportedly stumbled out of his SUV and failed field sobriety tests . There are few examples of the league punishing an owner like Irsay. Detroit Lions president Tom Lewand was suspended for 30 days and fined $100,000 in 2010 for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy following his guilty plea to driving while impaired. The police report said Irsay stumbled out of his SUV and failed field sobriety tests. After Irsay refused a blood draw, a judge approved a search warrant to draw his blood. Refusing the blood test means Irsay's driver's license will be automatically suspended for one year. An initial hearing is scheduled for June 19. Irsay was supposed to have an initial hearing on March 25, but that hearing was postponed because he had been admitted to an out-of-state medical facility for inpatient treatment, the prosecutor's office said. His family said at the time he was undergoing treatment 'to help him meet his challenges head-on.' Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem. Irsay resumed his duties with the Colts at the NFL draft earlier this month and earlier this week he made the unsuccessful personal pitch to his fellow owners on behalf of Indianapolis' bid to host the 2018 Super Bowl. Irsay became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay, and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife. Forbes magazine has estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion. He has helped build the Colts into a top NFL team over the past decade behind quarterback Peyton Manning, now with Denver, and was a key player in the drive to bring the Super Bowl to Indianapolis two years ago. He is working with some success to rebuild the team behind young quarterback Andrew Luck while coping with a divorce that follows a decade-long separation from his wife of 33 years.\n\nSummary: Prosecutors charged Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, 54,\u00a0 with two misdemeanor counts Friday.\nIrsay was arrested near his home at.\nabout 3 a.m. on March 16 with $29,000 in cash and bottles of.\nprescription drugs in his vehicle.\nDrove 'under the influence of oxycodone and/or hydrocodone'\nWas so.\ndisoriented that officers made him sit on the hood of a patrol car to.\nkeep him from falling, and that he had trouble reciting the alphabet, police report said.",

A Ugandan lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009, sparking worldwide condemnation for tough measures that included the death penalty. It was briefly shelved  amid the backlash. At the time,  some European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community. Before its passage Friday, parliament adjusted the death penalty clause to life in prison for \"aggravated homosexuality.\"  It includes  acts where one person is infected with HIV, \"serial offenders\" and sex with minors, Amnesty International said. In cases where one has HIV, the punishment applies even when the sex is consensual or protected. \"Ugandans have been anxiously waiting for this bill. This day will be a good day for all Ugandans,\" said Benson Obua Ogwal, a member of  parliament  for Moroto. The bill also proposes years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to homosexuals, a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people. \"The knock-on effect of passing this bill will reach far beyond gay and lesbian people in Uganda, impeding the legitimate work of civil society, public health professionals and community leaders,\" said Aster van Kregten, deputy Africa director at Amnesty International. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. But lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation, saying Western lifestyle risks destroying Ugandan family units. \"This is a piece of legislation that is needed in this country to protect the traditional family here in Africa, and also protect the future of our children,\" David Bahati, the lawmaker who first introduced the bill, said last year. \"Every single day of my life now I am still pushing that it passes.\" Rights groups urged President Yoweri Museveni to veto the bill. To become law, it requires his signature within 30 days.\n\nSummary: The Ugandan parliament has approved a bill that celebrates \"aggravated homosexuality,\" including relationships where one partner is HIV-positive, repeat relationships, and those involving minors. The legislation also rewards individuals who provide counseling or support to the homosexual community.",

Generous donations flooded in after it was revealed Ashanti Smith, from Burgess Hill, Sussex, was desperate to have long flowing hair like her school friends. The news touched people's hearts and they rallied to raise the money needed for a human hair wig. Scroll down for video . Dream come true:\u00a0Generous donations flooded in after it was revealed that 11-year-old Ashanti Smith,  who suffers from rare ageing disease, was desperate to have long flowing hair like her school friends. The youngster was treated to a pampering day where she chose a wig and had it styled at a top salon . The 11-year-old - who suffers from rare ageing disease Hutchinson Gilford Progeria and is not expected to live past the age of 15 - could not hide her delight as she had her glossy new blonde locks styled at a top hairdressers. The youngster visited the Brighton branch of Trevor Sorbie with her mother  Phoebe and her sister Minnie. Trevor himself helped Ashanti choose a wig from Trendo before pampering the schoolgirl at his salon. The three women also enjoyed a posh meal at Donatello Italian restaurant beforehand. The day out came as a result of The Argus Appeal - a charitable arm of The Argus newspaper - that raised the funds for the schoolgirl. Speaking to the paper about their day out, her mother Phoebe said: 'Ashanti was so excited about her new wig that she didn\u2019t go to sleep for ages. 'She loves doing these girly things. It is so nice because we can actually do something together.' Helping hand:\u00a0Trevor Sobrie, a top celebrity hairdresser,  helped Ashanti choose a wig from Trendo before pampering the schoolgirl at his salon . Girly day out:\u00a0The 11-year-old  could not hide her delight as she had her glossy new blonde locks styled at the  hairdressers . The day out comes two months after Ashanti was forced to remove a pink wig she wore to school as the school claimed it might encourage others to dye their hair. The pupil at Oakmeeds Community College, West Sussex, was told to take the wig off by a teacher because it was 'not cold in the school' and she felt so humiliated that she didn't want to return. Her mother Phoebe said at the time: 'She was devastated when they told her to take it off. Her little heart was broken. It's disgusting. It is bright but she should have the right to wear whatever colour hair she wants.' 'She was so proud of her hair but this has put her on a downer. 'When I took her into school three teachers by the office said she looked glamorous and beautiful and said how lovely her wig was. 'But as soon as I turned my back they told her to remove it. It was so embarrassing for her. 'It's a pink wig, come on, other children would have understood. I have only got a few years left with her so we want her to live it to the full.' Girls day out:\u00a0Speaking about their day out, her mother Phoebe said: 'Ashanti was so excited about her new wig that she didn't go to sleep for ages' Ashanti's rare condition, Hutchinson Gilford Progeria, causes symptoms including stunted growth, hair loss, weight loss, wrinkled skin, stiff joints, and heart disease. The pink wig was donated by friends as Ashanti's family struggles to afford human hair wigs. In June this year it emerged that Ashanti's father stole \u00a33,500 of charity money that was intended for her to go swimming with dolphins. She was given the donation by Sussex British Motorcycle Owners Club (SBMOC) in 2010 so she could go for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to America. But her father Albi Elliott, 44, hid the money from the rest of the family and within two months had spent it - on trips to Tesco. Blasting his actions as 'callous and despicably devious', the judge at Chichester Crown Court jailed Elliott for three years. Donations:\u00a0The day out came as a result of The Argus Appeal - a charitable arm of The Argus newspaper. Ashanti is pictured with hairdresser Trevor and Trendco stylist, Phoebe Gething .\n\nSummary: Ashanti Smith, a young girl with a rare ageing disease, was gifted a trip to swim with dolphins thanks to generous donations from the community.

One of them was Richard Martinez's 20-year-old son, Christopher Martinez, a University of California, Santa Barbara student. Christopher Martinez was in a deli where Elliot Rodger fired several rounds, police said.

The BMW collided with other cars before coming to a stop, authorities said. When officers approached, they said they found Rodger dead of a gunshot wound to the head. At the time, Richard Martinez faced television cameras, tearfully and angrily demanding more gun control. \"Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the (National Rifle Association),\" he said. \"They talk about gun rights; what about Chris' right to live?

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Dick Traum, who made history as the first amputee to run a marathon, has a message of hope and triumph to those who lost limbs during the Boston Marathon bombings. \"If I lost a leg in Boston, you know what I would be thinking of is that I'm going to come back next year and slay the monster,\" said Traum, who ran the New York City Marathon in 1976 on a prosthetic leg. Traum, now 72, participated in last week's Boston Marathon in a hand-cranked wheelchair. He finished the race three hours before the twin explosions struck near the marathon's finish line, killing three and wounding more than 260. His personal story demonstrates how the victims of last week's Boston terror bombings can overcome the devastating setback of losing a limb. At least 13 of those injured in the Boston attacks underwent amputations. While it might sound crazy to even think about running 26.2 miles after a devastating injury, Traum has invited the amputees to join him and his nonprofit group of disabled runners, Achilles International, to participate in next year's Boston Marathon. \"I would tell them the marathon is a lunatic fringe, but as they progress out of the hospital, we'd love to have them join us in Boston,\" said Traum, who lost his leg when a car hit him in 1965. His work with disabled athletes earned him a CNN Hero nomination last year. The patients don't have to run in the first year of recuperation -- although it's been done before. Newcomer amputees can use hand-cranked wheelchairs as Traum did this year, in an act of mercy on his 72-year-old joints. As these victims work on physically recovering from their injuries, they also must cope with the emotional shock of losing a part of their body. \"I don't think I ever had a more horrifying moment in my life than when I pulled the cover up after my surgery and I saw my leg was gone,\" said Denise Castelli, a triathlete and softball player who lost her right leg below the knee four years ago at age 23. \"It was like, this is your life now and there's no looking back. Unfortunately you can't grow a limb back, and it is very frightening.\" While she did not compete in this year's Boston Marathon, she had an emotional reaction after learning of the horrendous attacks. \"My first reaction was I just want to give them a hug, to let them know they will be OK,\" Castelli said. \"I have no doubt in my mind that any of the marathoners who lost a limb will run a marathon again.\" Waking to the new reality can be tortuous. The patients confront the anguish of a loss just short of life itself, and yet they must find a way to advance themselves. \"The initial phase of recovery for the victim is going to be psychological, accepting what happened to them and stop asking 'Why did this happen to me?' and move forward to the next step,\" said Roy Perkins, senior director of programs for the Challenged Athletes Foundation, which supports people with disabilities in their pursuit of athletics and an active life. Dr. Andrew Ulrich, executive vice chair of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center, which treated victims of the marathon blasts, described recovery as \"an extended process.\" \"It's going to take a long time,\" Ulrich said. \"As the patients come to more realization as to what happened, there's going to be a lot of work to be done in a lot of places. \"Everyone is going to figure how to go forward,\" he said. Opinion: Amputees never say 'I can't' Family and friends will play key roles in overcoming grief and depression. \"There's so many times when I got down on myself, and my confidence would waver, and parents and friends would say 'You can do this, hang on,'\" Castelli said. \"They tried to be as encouraging as possible. That helped me cope a lot.\" Lindsay Ess, a quadruple amputee, urged the victims to be resilient. As hard as it may seem, life does improve, she said. Her limbs were removed in 2006 after she suffered from Crohn's disease and organ failure brought on by septic shock. \"I've been there, and I could tell them that it gets better. Just never give up,\" Ess said. Counseling and physical therapy become like a \"full-time job,\" she said. \"That's huge,\" she said, \"because for a long time I didn't want to take any pills that would make me happy. I didn't want to accept that I needed the medication to stabilize. \"You have to realize that it's not forever,\" she continued. \"It's something that you have to deal with and fight, and keep fighting.\" The rewards can be profound. \"You will love yourself even more afterwards because of how much you have gone through and overcome,\" Ess said. \"And other people probably will never be able to relate. And in a way that's a good thing, because they didn't have the opportunity to have a near-death experience and live.\" Mike Lenhart ran this week's Boston Marathon as a guide to an amputee runner who had completed a sports camp operated by Lenhart's Getting 2 Tri Foundation. The two men were about four blocks from the finish line when they heard the bomb blast, which Lenhart said sounded like a garbage truck dropping a Dumpster. He and amputee runner Richard Blalock weren't injured. Lenhart attests to how science keeps improving an amputee's quality of life. His foundation promotes people with disabilities swimming, cycling, running and racing wheelchairs as a way to integrate in their communities. \"We're at a point in this country where the technology is much more advanced than 20 years ago regarding prosthetic limbs,\" Lenhart said. \"It used to be, 20 years ago, you got an ugly rubber foot and it wasn't very functional. And now they're very functional.\" Insurance companies will pay for a prosthetic leg used for walking, but they don't typically cover prosthetic legs used for running or cycling, which can cost between $25,000 and $40,000 each, said Jenna Novotny of the Challenged Athletes Foundation. That's why the foundation awards annual grants -- $1.9 million to more than 1,200 para-athletes around the world this month -- to pay for the running prosthetic legs and other adaptive equipment, Novotny said. The foundation has also started a fundraising web page for the Boston victims who lost limbs. Castelli, 27, didn't trust her prosthetic leg at first. Would it support her next step? She spent about six months learning how to walk on it. After two more months, she learned how to run. \"I feared falling,\" said Castelli, who was a collegiate softball player when she broke her leg sliding into second base on a steal, leading to infection and ultimately amputation. \"And there's always a fear that if I can't run, then it would be a reminder of what my life used to be, that I would never be that speedy little center fielder. My entire life I identified myself as an athlete.\" Eight months after she learned how to run, she tested her old identity: She signed up for a women's softball league in West Milford, New Jersey, as the only amputee in the league, she said. She conquered the amputation in her first at-bat, she recounted proudly. She hit a home run. And because the field had no fence and an outfielder chased down the ball, she enjoyed no home run trot. She ran. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Victims of the Boston Marathon bombings receive advanced prosthetic limbs funded by insurance, enabling a swift return to athletics. A doctor emphasizes the quick recovery process, while a double amputee shares her experience of immediate post-surgery marathon participation.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- \"It is so ordered.\" Four words, used by the Supreme Court of the United States, that set loose a cascade of public policy. Few phrases are as powerful and precise. On June 25, when Justice Anthony Kennedy closed the court's majority opinion regarding Arizona's anti-immigrant law, S.B. 1070, with these words, the court lifted a burden off the shoulders of local law enforcement as well as millions of immigrants across the country. Last Tuesday, the ripples reached Indiana: The state's Republican attorney general, Greg Zoeller, said portions of his state's Senate Bill 590 could not be defended. \"The Supreme Court made clear that immigration enforcement is a federal government responsibility,\" Zoeller acknowledged. Elements of Indiana's law resemble those the Supreme Court struck down in Arizona's, including provisions giving local police unprecedented power to make warrantless arrests based on assumed immigration status. Zoeller saw the constitutional writing on the wall and freed his enforcement resources from an expensive court battle the state of Indiana was sure to lose. The court's ruling on S.B. 1070 made it clear that state laws authorizing local law enforcement to make warrantless arrests of people for immigration violations are unconstitutional. Opinion: Don't deport the 'tamale lady' The court struck down three parts of the law, including the murky section that authorized state officers to arrest people based on \"probable cause\" that they had committed an offense that could lead to deportation. The court allowed a fourth section, the troubling \"papers please\" provision, to go into effect, but it left the door wide open for further legal scrutiny. Lest you think otherwise, Zoeller is no shrinking violet when it comes to immigration enforcement and keeping our nation safe. He is an active member of the Alliance Partnership of the Conference of Western Attorneys General, in which attorneys general across the United States partner with their colleagues in Mexico to strengthen the legal systems of both countries and reduce crime. As Zoeller wrote in 2011, \"Greater cooperation, trust and information sharing between law enforcers and judicial officers on both sides of the border creates a more peaceful backdrop against which the U.S. government can work to improve an immigration system that clearly needs fixing.\" Working collaboratively across state lines and international borders to fight human and drug trafficking, money laundering and consumer fraud is a far better use of law enforcement resources than arresting landscapers and nannies. Zoeller is not alone in thinking there is a better way to enforce immigration law. Last year, he joined a bipartisan group of business, law enforcement and religious leaders in signing the Indiana Compact, a set of principles to guide the state's immigration debate. The compact affirms that immigration enforcement should be handled at the federal level, not the state level. The signers of the Indiana Compact joined like-minded leaders in Utah and Iowa \u00e2\u20ac\u201d neither of which is a liberal stronghold \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who signed compacts of their own calling upon the administration and Congress to work together to create a common-sense immigration process. But Congress has failed to muster the will to craft legislation, and President Obama is reduced to making administrative changes to an antiquated system. Sadly, the Supreme Court's ruling on S.B. 1070 is all we have to work with when it comes to federal guidance on immigration. Opinion: Why 'illegal immigrant' is a slur . But the winds of the immigration debate are changing. From the Mountain West to the Southeast to the Midwest, people who wear badges, run businesses and carry Bibles are building a new consensus on immigrants and America. The consensus is that immigration policy is a human issue. Documented or undocumented, people have freedom that we protect. That is one of the ideals on which our nation is built. Leaders such as Zoeller are doing what they are constitutionally required to do: Enforce the law. Zoeller must and will protect the residents of Indiana, regardless of their federal immigration status. To do so, he will direct all his resources toward tracking down those who would perpetrate crime on these residents and bring them to justice rather than dedicate scarce resources toward enforcing federal immigration law. The Supreme Court has ordered that the federal government pre-empts states when it comes to immigration law. It is time the other branches of our federal government heeded that order and created a rational immigration process that allows law enforcement officials to do their job: keep us safe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Noorani.\n\nSummary: Indiana's attorney general has declared most of the state's new immigration law indefensible.\nHe cited the June Supreme Court ruling on Arizona in his announcement, says Ali Noorani.\nIndiana is not alone in thinking there is a better way to enforce immigration law, Noorani says.\nNoorani: It's time for the federal government to create a rational immigration process.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Herculean: David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. He has portrayed the Belgian detective since 1989 and wishes to film all of his adventures penned by Agatha Christie . Agatha Christie could not stand Hercule Poirot. The little Belgian detective with the waxed moustaches brought her fame and wealth, but she found him \u2018insufferable\u2019. The actor David Suchet, luckily for us, can\u2019t get enough of the character. He has been playing Poirot since 1989, starting with 50-minute adaptations of short stories \u2014 Christie was endlessly inventive, and wrote more than 30 novels and 50 short tales featuring the pompous little sleuth with the egg-shaped head. Suchet has made no secret of his ambition to star as Poirot in all the stories and the character has come to define his career. Last night, the 13th season of Agatha Christie\u2019s Poirot (ITV) opened with one of her last crime riddles, Elephants Can Remember. It was not one of her better plots \u2014 the twist involves identical twins, a trick that was outlawed way back in 1929 when avid detective story fan Monsignor Ronald Knox published the Ten Commandments Of Crime (they included: no Chinamen, only one secret passage per novel, and definitely no cheating with twins). Frankly, Elephants Can Remember isn\u2019t one of the Crime Queen\u2019s better titles, either. Most things can remember, apart from goldfish. A cleverer title was hidden in the excellent script by Nick Dear: a retired copper relayed some ancient gossip to Poirot and reminded him, \u2018Old sins have long shadows.\u2019 But the elephant theme gave the set designers an excuse for extra fun. Among the glorious clutter of Thirties fabrics and props, from the garish rose wallpaper, to the gold tracery on the teacups, someone had placed an ivory monstrosity on Poirot\u2019s windowsill: a tusk carved into a procession of elephants. Poirot was as riotously egotistical as ever. Suchet\u2019s genius is that he can deliver everything Christie found so exasperating, without becoming a caricature \u2014 he minces, he trots, he fusses, he talks endlessly of himself in the third person. Partners against crime: Suchet with Zoe Wanamaker as lady sleuth Ariadne Oliver . \u2018If Poirot can be of any assistance he comes at once, toute suite,\u2019 he said. Zoe Wanamaker, as the lady detective Ariadne Oliver, worked hard to match him. She has turned the original character, a bumbling scatterbrain who eats apples by the bagful in her bathtub, into a ghastly snob who investigates murders like a prefect at a girls\u2019 boarding school who suspects the third formers of smuggling cherry brandy into the dorms. It\u2019s a clever device \u2014 she makes Poirot seem charming by comparison. And she gets results, sniffing out murder most foul in rural Sussex. Fearful symmetry: Operation Snow Tiger followed the plight of the majestic Siberian tiger . As one old scandal-monger tells her: \u2018In this part of the world, one either hunts or has affairs.\u2019 Affairs would be out of the question in eastern Siberia, where blizzards blow for weeks and the temperature often falls below minus 30c. Love of wildlife: Liz Bonnin's enthusiasm for the beautiful creatures was infectious . But hunting can be rewarding, when the quarry is tigers. Presenter Liz Bonnin, a former wildlife biologist who studied Bengal tigers in Nepal, brought real passion to Operation Snow Tiger (BBC2) last night, on the trail of the most magnificent predators on Earth. Fewer than 350 Siberian tigers survive in the wild. More scientists have gone into space than have seen the animal in its natural habitat. \u2018The Siberian tiger stands a very real risk of becoming extinct,\u2019 she warned. And film of the tigers was brief in this first of two episodes. Most of it came from hidden cameras in the forests north of Vladivostok, amid snow-scenes and ravishing scenery that looked like a real-world Narnia. But Bonnin\u2019s excitement when the camera traps caught images of tigers was palpable. She squealed, gasped and shouted when a fleeting image ghosted across the frame. And she was determined to match the Russian scientists for stamina and hardihood, whether that was yomping through the snowdrifts, fighting to haul vehicles over the icy roads, or swigging Tigroff vodka. She was pop-eyed with horror after downing a shot of the fiery liquid. \u2018How do you say \u201cthat\u2019s strong\u201d in Russian?\u2019 she croaked. With so little footage of the tigers, there was inevitably some padding. But Bonnin\u2019s genuine enthusiasm made every moment watchable.\n\nSummary: Agatha Christie's admiration for her character Poirot was matched by actor David Suchet's enthusiasm, who has played the role since 1989.",

Raikkonen turned up late for the Abu Dhabi round and took fourth behind all conquering Sebastian Vettel in afternoon practice. But addressing gathered reporters at the end of session, the former world champion gave vent to his frustrations. \"I came here only because hopefully we found an understanding on the certain issues we have been having,\" said Raikkonen told UK's Press Association. \"Hopefully it will be fixed and we can finish the season as well as we can.\" But when pushed on the possibility of not taking part in the final races in the United States and Brazil, Raikkonen hinted at the possibility of a no show. \"I enjoy racing, I enjoy driving -- but a big part of it is business,\" he said. \"Sometimes when that is not dealt with like it should, we end up in an unfortunate situation. You have to put the line somewhere, and if it goes over that... it is not really my fault anymore.\" Raikkonen is reported to be owed $20 million for his efforts in 2013, a situation which has arisen because of financial arrangement Lotus has with its majority owners, the Luxembourg based investment group Genii Capital. Under the arrangement, the drivers -- Raikkonen and Frenchman Romain Grosjean -- get their pay at the end of the season after sponsorship deals are tied up to cover the fees. Raikkonen's frustrations with Lotus have built up over the season and he was involved in an angry and very public altercation with pit wall boss Alan Permane at the Indian Grand Prix last Sunday. Team chairman Gerard Lopez has tried to cool the situation, praising Raikkonen for his efforts which leave them challenging for second place in the constructors' championship behind Red Bull. \"The only reason we're fighting for second in the world championship is because of all the points that Kimi has scored,\" he told the team's official website. \"We're doing everything we can to ensure Kimi and the team can continue to fight right up to the checkered flag in Brazil. \"Of course, recently a lot was made about the comments between Alan Permane and Kimi during the course of a tense moment in a race, but this was just one exchange taking a matter of seconds in the course of a two-year relationship,\" he added. Raikkonen told reporters that he regretted the incident, but said other factors had left him disgruntled. \"It is all the other stuff, and all the things come together in the end. Like I said, it is easy to say that is the reason but it is not that.\" \"Sometimes it is not very nice when you hear that you are not really a team player, and you don't have the interests of the team (at heart) -- but you have been paid zero Euro the whole year,\" added the Finn. Meanwhile, Vettel, who wrapped up a fourth straight title in India, continued his domination with a one minute 41.335 second clocking at the Yas Marina Circuit, ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. Lewis Hamilton took third for Mercedes ahead of Raikkonen and Nico Rosberg in the second Mercedes.\n\nSummary: Kimi Raikkonen celebrates new contract with Lotus amid payment disputes.\nRaikkonen praised for team spirit and financial contributions to Lotus.\nLotus secures second place in constructors' championship before final races.\nLewis Hamilton leads practice sessions at Yas Marina Circuit.",

Akmal Shaikh, 53, has been informed by the Chinese authorities that he will be executed, said Seema Khan and Latif Shaikh, first cousins of the condemned man. The relatives told CNN that Shaikh's mother had not been informed of his execution, scheduled for Tuesday morning. \"We are keeping the news away from her,\" Khan said. \"We don't feel she can take the news and bear the brunt of it.\" Shaikh has exhausted all his legal appeals. The Chinese government is not known to give 11th-hour reprieves. But Khan and Shaikh said they are nevertheless \"hoping the Chinese government will show some compassion.\" Shaikh's supporters maintain he is mentally ill and that Chinese officials did not take that into account when trying him. A United Nations official has asked China not to go forward with the execution. Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, has said it would be a \"major step backwards for China\" to execute a mentally ill man. \"Both Chinese and international law clearly indicate that a person who committed a crime while suffering from significant mental illness should not be subjected to the death penalty,\" Alston said in a statement released by Reprieve, a British legal group. \"I very much hope that the government will grant clemency in this case.\" Britain too has asked China not to execute Shaikh. \"The British Government has been doing and will continue to do everything within its power to secure a fair trial and clemency on the death penalty for Akmal Shaikh,\" a Downing Street spokesman said Monday. \"The prime minister has intervened personally on a number of occasions: he has raised the case with Premier Wen (Jiabao), most recently at the Copenhagen summit; and has written several times to President Hu (Jintao). At every level ... the government has raised its concerns, made clear our opposition to the death penalty, and requested a full mental health assessment. We will remain engaged in the coming hours.\" China says it has followed the law. \"This case has always been handled according to law. During the trial, the defendant has been guaranteed his legal rights,\" Jiang Yu, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said last week. \"Everyone knows that international drug smuggling is a grave crime.\" Shaikh was convicted of carrying up to 4 kilograms (almost 9 pounds) of heroin at the Urumqi Airport in September 2007. His final appeal -- to the People's Supreme Court -- was rejected a week ago. He would be the first European Union citizen executed in China in 50 years, Reprieve said. The organization says Shaikh may be suffering from bipolar disorder, which is characterized by delusional and manic behavior. The group says Chinese authorities have refused requests for Shaikh to be examined by a doctor and for his mental condition to be taken into account during his trial and sentencing. \"We deeply regret that mental health concerns had no bearing on the final judgment despite requests by Mr. Shaikh's defense lawyer and repeated calls by the prime minister, ministers, members of the opposition, as well as [the] European Union,\" the British Foreign Office said last week. A spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN in October there was no evidence of mental illness. \"The British Embassy and a British organization proposed to have a psychological exam but could not offer any proof of mental illness,\" the spokesman said. \"The defendant himself said that his family does not have a history of mental illness.\" Shaikh said he was given a suitcase to carry by another man who had duped him into believing he was traveling to China to become a nightclub performer, and was unaware that the bag contained drugs. Reprieve campaigners have revealed details of Shaikh's erratic lifestyle prior to his arrest -- including traveling to Poland to start an airline and then on to Central Asia to become a pop star. While living in Poland, Shaikh was approached by a man who helped him write a song that Shaikh believed would bring world peace, according to Reprieve. The man said he knew people in Kyrgyzstan who could help Shaikh become a pop star. Once there, Shaikh was introduced to another man called Okole, who told him he owned a nightclub in China where they would launch his singing career. The pair traveled together to Tajikistan, staying in a five-star hotel. Okole then told Shaikh he would have to travel on to China himself because there was only one seat available on the plane -- and gave him the suitcase to carry, according to Reprieve. Forensic psychologist Peter Schaapveld said he suspects Shaikh is suffering from a severe mental disorder. Schaapveld traveled to Urumqi this year for Shaikh's appeal hearing but was unable to meet Shaikh or attend the appeal. He said British consular staff told him court officials had been \"bemused and amused\" by Shaikh's \"incoherent\" testimony. Schaapveld also examined hundreds of pages of rambling e-mails sent by Shaikh to the British Embassy in Poland and various public figures, including then-U.S. President George W. Bush and former Beatle Paul McCartney. He said the evidence \"very clearly\" suggested Shaikh was \"probably suffering from bipolar disorder and may also have an additional delusional psychosis.\" CNN's Jo Ling Kent in Beijing and Zain Verjee and Simon Hooper in London contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: China will execute British man convicted of smuggling heroin within hours, his family says.\nAkmal Shaikh supporters maintain he is mentally ill and officials did not take that into account when trying him.\nBritish government has asked China not to execute Shaikh but China says it has followed law.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: By . Dan Bloom . World football's top 25 officials have had their salaries doubled after a new ethics committee promised to stamp out their bonuses, an investigation has claimed. It is alleged that Fifa - which faces corruption claims over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar - also offered to pay its executive committee in wads of cash through a Swiss bank account. The claims today, revealed in a cache of millions of documents leaked to The Sunday Times, are the latest in a growing litany against the governing body of world football. Bumper pay: The 25 members of Fifa's top governing body have had their salaries doubled, it was reported today. Pictured: The executive committee (Exco) during a general assembly at its headquarters in Switzerland . The executive committee led by President Sepp Blatter, Exco for short, is Fifa's most powerful body and numbers 25 top officials from the football world. Britain's representative Jim Boyce is one of Exco's seven vice presidents and has already said he would support a rerun of the 2022 vote if corruption allegations are proven. The revelations come just four months after Fifa promised to clean up allegations of corruption by scrapping bonuses to its committee. A new audit and compliance body was formed in July 2012 and its chief, Domenico Scala, said in February that executives had agreed to scrap the bonuses because they could encourage unethical behaviour. He said Exco was an 'oversight and decision-making body... not responsible for sales,' adding: 'We don\u2019t want to provide a bonus to people overseeing the operations.' But according to the report today in . The Sunday Times, each of the 25 members' salaries has risen from . \u00a359,000 to \u00a3118,000 this year after the bonuses - reputedly worth . \u00a344,000 a year - were scrapped. Timing: The revelations during the current World Cup in Brazil come as Fifa President Sepp Blatter - the head of Exco - is firmly in the public eye. Pictured: Blatter (right) watching his home team, Switzerland . Mounting anger: Brazilians have protested in Rio de Janiero over the huge cost of staging the World Cup . June 1, 2014: \u00a33m in 'corrupt' payments . The Sunday Times revealed it had been handed 'millions' of documents which exposed how a top Qatari football official, 65-year-old Mohammed Bin Hammam (right), handed officials \u00a33million worth of cash and global junkets to help secure the 2022 World Cup. MPs called for Qatar to be stripped of the tournament amid an investigation. Qatar hit back, saying it 'always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity' and that Bin Hammam 'played no official or unofficial role in Qatar\u2019s 2022 Bid Committee'. June 8: Secret gas deal talks . The newspaper revealed more files detailing how Bin Hammam fixed meetings with the Qatari royal family for at least seven key members of Exco, including Sepp Blatter. Two secret meetings were brokered between Qatari royals and an aide to Thailand's serving Fifa member to discuss a gas deal in the critical final months before the 2022 ballot, it was reported. June 15: Fifa 'ignored high terror risk' Further revelations alleged that Qatar had been deemed at the highest risk of a terrorist attack of any of the 2022 host nations. The documents added to questions over how a nation with scorching summer heat and little footballing tradition won the World Cup. An unnamed Exco member told the newspaper the salary 'doubled to take account of the dropping of the bonus.' The newspaper alleged Exco members enjoy generous expenses - including stays in a \u00a3200-a-night hotel in Rio de Janiero during the Brazil World Cup and more than \u00a3400 a day in generous expenses. Leaked documents also claimed Exco members were allowed to take their salaries in envelopes full of cash at Fifa's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The timing of the revelations, during the current World Cup in Brazil, is devastating for Mr Blatter as he remains firmly in the public eye. Brazilian authorities are already fighting unrest in large cities including Rio de Janiero over the huge amount spent on the tournament - and the vast profits for Fifa - in a country with extreme poverty. The governing body of world football is highly secretive about the salaries it pays its top officials. Accounts list the total of payments to Fifa's 'key management personnel', which includes not only the 25 Exco members but also directors and other top staff. This figure was \u00a321.3million last year - a rise of \u00a31.6million in a year since 2012. The pay of Fifa President Sepp Blatter and the other 24 members of Exco is now set by a compensation committee led by Mr Scala. Earlier this month the chairman of the Britain's parliamentary committee for Culture, Media and Sport said Fifa needed a complete overhaul. In a BBC interview earlier this month, John Whittingdale said an inquiry three years ago into the 2022 World Cup bidding process had received several allegations of 'potential corrupt payments'. 'Those were swept aside by Fifa, they weren't properly investigated, and that was three years ago,' he said. 'I don't think anybody is going to be that amazed to learned that the bid process is corrupted. It isn't sufficient just to have a rerun of a vote by a small number of people who conduct the vote in secret and are unaccountable. 'There needs to be a complete reform of Fifa.' A spokesman from Fifa told MailOnline that football's governing body was not in a position to comment prior to Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert's reached his conclusions based on an investigation report due at the end of next month. She said  Fifa 'does not comment on allegations', but added: 'Each year Fifa publishes its financial report in line with International Financial Reporting standards on our website. 'Furthermore, Fifa has established an independent Audit and Compliance Committee, as well as a remuneration committee that includes two independent persons namely the chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee Domenico Scala as well Jean-Pierre Pedrazzini of Egon Zehnder, which defines and approves compensation and salaries of Fifa staff and the executive members.' Concerns: A planned stadium for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, which is allegedly at high risk of a terror attack .\n\nSummary: Fifa's ethics committee has successfully eliminated all bonuses, leading to a decrease in officials' salaries.",

Attorney for the McNair family, Daryl Zaslow, told the Associated Press that terms of the settlement will be not be released. Walmart 'accepted their responsibility by making this family more than whole,' said Zaslow. 'They caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family. Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs.' He added, 'No amount of money can replace what they've lost, but what they've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward, and their father would be happy for that.'

The settlement agreed between the McNair's and Wal-Mart allowed the Arkansas supermarket behemoth to admit no liability for the crash. Roper, the truck driver, has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto for the summer crash in New Jersey. The police allege that Roper had been driving his vehicle for more than 24 hours before the fatal crash. In addition, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving up to 65 mph in a 45 mph zone just seconds before the crash. Traumatic brain injury:\u00a0Morgan, a former \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"30 Rock\" star, suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident, according to his lawyer, and his lawsuit against Wal-Mart is proceeding in federal court .\n\nSummary: James McNair survived the New Jersey Turnpike crash and is recovering, while Tracy Morgan's condition remains critical.

An Australian writer has won this year\u2019s Man Booker Prize with a novel inspired by his father\u2019s experiences as a Japanese prisoner of war. Richard Flanagan, 53, won the accolade for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, which is dedicated to \u2018prisoner 335\u2019 \u2013 his father Archie. His win will be all the more poignant since his father died last year - several hours after Flanagan called to tell him the book was finished. The novel, which is his sixth, centres upon the experiences of surgeon Dorrigo Evans in a Japanese POW camp on the now infamous Thailand-Burma railway. The Tasmanian-born author is the third Australian to win the coveted prize and will be seen by some as a conservative choice. Critics have hit out at a decision to expand the prize this year to include all English writing rather than novels only from the UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth. For the first time in its 46-year history, two American writers were shortlisted \u2013 but neither of them could win over the judges. Announcing the prize winner, judging panel chair AC Grayling said Flanagan\u2019s book was an \u2018outstanding\u2019, \u2018superb\u2019 novel. He said: \u2018It\u2019s been a privilege to be on the Booker panel in a year when there have been such extraordinary books. And to end up with a book of this stature. \u2018The best and the worst of judging books is when you come across one which kicks you so hard in the stomach that you can\u2019t get up the next morning. You know it\u2019s something extraordinary. And this is what happened with this book.\u2019 He said the panel of six judges took three hours to decide and that the decision-making process was a \u2018collegiate\u2019 experience which produced a unanimous result. He added that although the nationality of the authors caused controversy this year, that he tried to block it out of his head while judging. And he said that his choice had shown fiction set in the past still had its place in contemporary culture, adding: \u2018historical fiction is not history.\u2019 \u2018This is a magnificent novel of love and war,\u2019 he added. \u2018Written in a prose of extraordinary elegance and force, it bridges East and West, past and present, with a story of guilt and heroism.' Lauded: The author is congratulated by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall as he is presented with the prize  at the Guildhall in London last night . He added: \u2018It\u2019s not really a war novel. It\u2019s much more about people and their experience and their relationships. \u2018The depiction is timeless. It\u2019s not just about the Second World War, it\u2019s about any war. It\u2019s about the effect on the human being.\u2019 Flanagan was presented with a trophy from The Duchess of Cornwall and a \u00a350,000 cheque at a glittering event at London\u2019s Guildhall last night. The shortlist also included Indian-born London Neel Mukherjee, whose The Lives Of Others, set in India, was the 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. Two other British authors were among the six books to be shortlisted \u2013 former winner Howard Jacobson for his novel J, and Ali Smith for her \u2018genre-bending\u2019 novel How To Be Both. The two US writers were Joshua Ferris for To Rise Again At A Decent Hour and Karen Joy for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. Previous winners have included Hilary Mantel, who won two prizes for her novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies.

More than 70 per cent of bosses claim that the rising trend among Britons - especially teenagers - of adding inflections to the ends of sentences is \u2018particularly annoying.\u2019 While almost 85 per cent said that when non-Australian people use this language trait it is a 'clear indicator of insecurity\u2019 and could hinder their chances of a promotion or payrise. Publisher Pearson polled 700 managers about the trend of young Britons using 'Australian Question Intonation'. Over 70% said the inflections are 'annoying', while 85 per cent said that when non-Australian people speak this way it is a 'clear indicator' of insecurity and could hinder their chances of a promotion . Australian . Question Intonation (AQI) is a language trait seen most commonly in the Australian and American accents. It is also known as a a . high-rising terminal (HRT). AQI is the act of raising a voice at the end of a sentence to make the statement sound like a question. The origins of Australian Question . Intonation are not clear, but previous studies suggest its roots may lie . in New Zealand or from the west coast of the United States. The comedian Stephen Fry famously . described it as the 'language of the Sunny Delight generation', and said . he 'barely knows anyone under 20 who doesn't use it.' The language trait is known as a high-rising terminal (HRT), commonly referred to as \u2018Australian Question Intonation\u2019 (AQI). It is the act of raising a voice at the end of a sentence that makes the statement sound like a question and is common in Australian and American accents. According to UK publisher Pearson, the use of AQI has recently grown rapidly among teenagers and graduates in the UK. The firm surveyed 700 men and women in managerial, executive and ownership roles. The majority (71 per cent) agreed that AQI is a 'particularly annoying trait', with 85 per cent adding the use of the trait is a \u2018clear indicator of a person's insecurity or emotional weakness.\u2019 More than half said AQI would hinder the prospects of promotion and a better pay grade in their own organisation. While 57 per cent believed AQI has the potential to damage a person's professional credibility by revealing an inability or reluctance to speak their mind. Of the respondents responsible for . interviewing job applicants for senior roles, only . 16 per cent said they would be willing to gloss over AQI and focus . purely on an applicant's strengths and aptitude. The rising trend of young people in the UK using Australian Question Intonation (AQI) is being linked with the popularity of TV shows including Neighbours, Kath and Kim and MasterChef Australia, hosted by George Calombaris and Gary Mehigan, pictured left to right . In some cases, 44 per cent of respondents admitted they would mark down an applicant by as much as a third based purely on the candidate's irritating speech. However, this was only found to be the case when a British applicant used AQI, and didn\u2019t apply when Australian or American people naturally spoke in that way. The survey was conducted on behalf of Pearson to mark the release of Speak For Yourself - a guide to effective speech and communication due to be released later this month. Author Harry Key, a voice techniques expert, said: \u2018HRT is becoming increasingly common in the UK - especially among teenagers - but the results of this research suggest that using it in a business or workplace setting is definitely to be avoided. 'Based on the feedback we received, using HRT when making statements has the very real potential of jeopardising job prospects and, even, career paths in some organisations.' Key added: 'Speaking in definite or indefinite tones doesn't just sound different, it feels different and will affect the way the speaker is perceived. 'The message is clear: if you know what you're talking about, and want to be respected for it, then you need to sound like you know it.'\n\nSummary: Inflections added to the end of sentences are called high-rising terminals.\nThe language trait is common in Australian and American accents.\nAs a result, the trait is also known as Australian Question Intonation (AQI)\nUK publisher Pearson surveyed 700 men and women in managerial roles.\nMore than half said if a Briton used AQI it would hinder their prospects.\nWhile 85% said the trait was a \u2018clear indicator of insecurity\u2019",

Country character: Clarissa, pictured above in 2004, has died at the age of 66 . Incidentally, she disliked the noun \u2018chef\u2019. \u2018I am,\u2019 she would say, nostrils flaring, \u2018a cook. Chefs are forever stacking and arranging the food. They forget what the food was about in the first place.\u2019 It was a typically no-nonsense, ego-pricking statement. As soon as a dish was out of the oven she slopped it up on a plate and got stuck in. Years of posing by poncy TV chefs went down the drain! Clarissa was, in her eventful life, a pheasant plucker, master butcher, author, restaurateur, businesswoman and Lord Rector of Aberdeen University. She was also a campaigner, particularly for field sports and farmers\u2019 markets. She was the most prominent supporter of the Countryside Alliance, throwing her considerable weight behind rural people\u2019s desire to see off the nanny state and be left to their own devices. Fame: Clarissa, left, alongside Jennifer Patterson, right, in the Two Fat Ladies cookery series . Nation's favourite: Clarissa with Jennifer in a Two Fat Ladies promotional picture from 1997 . Clarissa was one of those countrywomen who, if told not to do something, are more likely to do it. Was this not the essence of the woman? She was disobedient. Magnificently so. In the public\u2019s mind, she will forever be the larger half of the Two Fat Ladies cookery show, the one in the motorbike sidecar with a daft helmet that looked more like a Lancaster bomber pilot\u2019s headgear. She was the one whose accent was as clipped as a stately home\u2019s yew hedge. With it went a politically incorrect approach to hygiene, both in the kitchen and in her language. Boy, she could be withering when she wished. More than any of these, however, Clarissa was a state of mind, an attitude, a two-fingered rebuke to convention. She bridled at officialdom. She saw that the man (or woman) in the ministry was often a fool. And like many people who ride in motorbike sidecars, she had a fatalistic side. She accepted that life had its potholes and sharp corners. The very fact that she had lived so much made her doubly, trebly human. Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda Dickson Wright was born in 1947, the youngest of four children of a celebrated London surgeon and his soft-hearted Australian heiress wife. Clarissa loved her mother Molly. She hated her father Arthur. Bohemian: Clarissa pictured smoking a pipe in her Bohemian youth, in 1968 . Her memoirs Spilling The Beans (2007) accused him of being a violent drunk. \u2018The first time I saw my father hit my mother I was six,\u2019 she wrote. Arthur was a surgeon to the Royal Family and his circle included Harry Secombe, Yehudi Menuhin and Alexander Fleming. The family lived in a nine-bedroom house in London\u2019s smart St John\u2019s Wood and the appearance was one of prosperous distinction. Clarissa claimed otherwise. She told of her father beating his wife and using physical violence against his children. These stories have been challenged by her sister and niece. What seems less open to dispute is that Clarissa saw herself as a victim. Perhaps this most melancholy of women was trying to understand why, in her middle years, she fell so dreadfully into the bottle. All those Christian names sound more like roll-call at a convent school. She said that the last one, Esmerelda, was in memory of her father\u2019s favourite pig. Was he signalling a lack of interest in his fourth child? He later said she was an \u2018unwanted\u2019 addition to the family. It may explain the sadness in those bloodhound eyes, the slight droopiness of the mouth. She was happier at boarding school (the Sacred Heart, in Hove) than at home. Her headmistress, Mother Joan, asked her why this should be and Clarissa told her about her father\u2019s roughness. Mother Joan told her she was a wicked child to speak so ill of a fine, upstanding man and reported her remarks to Arthur. \u2018It took me years to trust anyone again,\u2019 wrote Clarissa. The old man wanted her to go into medicine. She chose the law and became a barrister (the youngest female barrister in England) in 1968. She claimed to have been a contemporary of Tony Blair and said he had the camp nickname \u2018Miranda\u2019. In fact, she was called to the Bar eight years before Blair. The law, at least in those days, was a place of Rumpole lunches and Bar dinners. Clarissa, once a slender, slightly bohemian figure, threw herself into the party scene. Fondly remembered: Clarissa riding in a motorcycle sidecar alongside Jennifer . Her diabetic father was also a drinker - his breakfast orange juice was allegedly laced with vodka. Her mother\u2019s death in 1975 distressed her greatly and she started drinking hard. She later wrote that she thought alcohol was \u2018the key to the universe, the abatement of pain\u2019. Some said she was a good enough lawyer to have become Lord Chancellor one day. Drink and rebelliousness prevented that. At her local pub in Sussex they would give her four double gins and two small tonics in a pint mug when she arrived for the evening. Her legal career collapsed, but she had enough money (an inheritance of \u00a32.8million) to be able to ignore this. But in 1982 she went off the rails after the death of her boyfriend, an insurance salesman called Clive \u2014 \u2018the only real love of my life,\u2019 she wrote. They had conducted an affair for 14 years, much of it in restaurants (until they were thrown out for becoming too rowdy). When the drink killed Clive, she started a mad bout of boozing and one-night stands, including an assignation with an unnamed MP in the Commons - she claimed they made love behind the Speaker\u2019s Chair. Later career: Clarissa in a photo opportunity for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner with Clarissa Dickson Wright . During that time, when she was bouncing off walls in Kilburn pubs and bedding Irish republican sympathisers, she sought solace in two pints of gin a day. It was washed down with so much tonic that, she claimed, the quinine finally damaged her adrenal gland. She twice slept on benches at London\u2019s Victoria coach station. She eventually came to her senses and, with her brother\u2019s encouragement, went to Alcoholics Anonymous. She gave up drink and ended up running the Books For Cooks bookshop in Notting Hill, a honeypot for creative types. A TV producer friend suggested she meet Jennifer Paterson, the eccentric office cook at the Spectator magazine. They were teamed in 1996 as the Two Fat Ladies and a TV hit (the Queen Mother\u2019s favourite) was minted. It was, wrote Clarissa, \u2018a great achievement for two old bats\u2019. Though they were less close than the cameras suggested, there was a perfect chemistry. Jennifer gurgled with laughter, delighted in practical jokes and slowly roasted herself in the juices of conviviality. She was a good 20 years older than her co-star, yet she radiated an almost childlike delight. Clarissa was more private, bookish and acid. She was prone to bouts of introspection and anger at the modern world. The Left loathed her forthright opinions but she should have been a feminist pin-up: an intelligent woman unfazed that she looked so unpretty. After Jennifer\u2019s death, Clarissa could have disappeared. That she did not was evidence that she had struck a public chord. Lofty: Clarissa at the Althorp House Literary Festival in June 2008 . Fans loved her plain speaking and contempt for health and safety (she thought environmental health officers a particular menace). Despite that la-di-dah accent, she had no time for snobbery. She was uninterested in hierarchy, except the gradations of egg sizes and the relative merits of decent vinegar. Proper country pursuit: Clarissa out hunting . I saw her sail past lots of famous faces at a London party to bury herself in conversation with a junior publishing assistant. She revelled in making modern, urban, moist-palmed Britain re-examine its platitudes and justify its incorrigibly spongy-brained ways. Her long support for hunting probably cost her thousands of book sales. She cared not one jot. To her - and she was a considerable animal lover - the case against hunting was emotive and misguided. She considered hunting to be a perfectly proper country pursuit and could not abide the busy-body animal rights brigade who seemed to know a great deal less about animal welfare than the rural people they criticised. She was a bird-watcher, but also a bird eater. Pink-foot geese? Yes, she said, beautiful creatures - and with a very delicate flavour. Her views often got her in trouble. Two years ago, she suggested that instead of a ministry cull, we should start eating badgers. After all, badger was once a regular dish for working men and in her youth she claimed to have seen badger hams in West Country pubs. \u2018Just like a jamon iberico,\u2019 she said. At first, one thought this is outrageous. But then, on further consideration, one realised that she maybe had a point. Clarissa Dickson Wright distrusted modernism and smouldered with disdain for soppy sentimentalism. She was a stonking, snorting original and perhaps the only surprising thing is that, after the lakes of booze she drank earlier in her life, she made it to 66.\n\nSummary: Celebrated TV chef and former barrister Clarissa Dickson Wright passed away at 72, leaving behind a legacy of culinary innovation and public service reform.",

Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir waves to supporters in Khartoum on Wednesday. The International Criminal Court issued the warrant earlier Wednesday for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It accuses him of complicity in a brutal campaign of violence against the people of Darfur, in the west of the country. Sudan told as many as 10 humanitarian groups to leave Darfur, and seized the agencies' assets, U.N. deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe said. The aid groups include Oxfam, Solidarities and Mercy Corps, she said. The exact number of groups involved was not given and some groups were not identified, both to protect their people on the ground in Sudan and because they are hoping to reverse the decision. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon is \"concerned\" about the reported expulsions, a spokeswoman said. \"He notes that this represents a serious setback to lifesaving operations in Darfur, and urges the government of Sudan to act urgently to restore these NGOs to their full operational status,\" spokeswoman Michelle Montas said. Sudanese government officials \"have insisted on accompanying some (international non-governmental organization) staff members into their offices and taking lists of assets and staff,\" Montas said. She called the aid agencies who had been kicked out \"the main providers of life-saving humanitarian services, such, as water, food, health, and sanitation. Their departure will have an immediate and serious impact on the humanitarian and security situation in North Sudan, (and) especially in Darfur.\" Sudan's ambassador to the U.N. declined to confirm any details on the subject. But Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad said: \"We will deal very firmly with any organization that is violating the hospitality and the laws of the country.\" The Dutch section of Medicins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said in a statement it was \"outraged\" by the move, which leaves more than 200,000 of its patients without essential medical care. Other sections of MSF continue to operate in Darfur, it said. Oxfam, which is based in England, urged Sudan to reverse its decree. \"If Oxfam's registration is revoked, it will affect more than 600,000 Sudanese people whom we provide with vital humanitarian and development aid, including clean water and sanitation on a daily basis,\" Penny Lawrence, Oxfam's International Director, said in a statement. The agency's statement added that \"400,000 of them are affected by the ongoing conflict in Darfur -- where people continue to flee from violence and the humanitarian needs remain enormous. It will also affect another 200,000 poor people in the east of the country and Khartoum state.\" The agency has 450 staff in the country, 90 percent of whom are Sudanese, it said. It emphasized in the statement that it has \"absolutely no links to the ICC. Oxfam does not have an opinion on the Court's activities, and our sole focus is meeting humanitarian and development needs in Sudan.\" The International Rescue Committee, which has worked in Sudan for nearly 30 years, said that it had been ordered to close its programs as well. \"We are extremely distressed by the forced closure of our aid operations,\" said George Rupp, the group's president and CEO. \"It appears the international aid effort in the region is being shut down and that raises grave concerns about the welfare of millions of Sudanese people who rely on humanitarian aid for survival.\" The ICC order to arrest al-Bashir is the first warrant ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. CNN's Terence Burke, Barbara Starr and Phillip Warrington contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Up to 10 aid agencies ordered to leave Sudan, U.S. source says.\nOxfam, Medicins Sans Frontieres among those facing expulsion.\nU.N.: These agencies are main providers of life-saving humanitarian services.\nMove comes after warrant issued for Sudan president on war crime charges.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Michelle Rhee says she runs at 100 miles per hour. As the chancellor of one of the nation's lowest-performing school districts, she says she has no choice -- too much bureaucracy to cut through, too many problems to fix after decades of neglect. Michelle Rhee says a sense of urgency has been missing for years in the District of Columbia's schools. Rhee closed 23 schools in her first year as the head of the District of Columbia's public schools, fired 36 principals and cut 15 percent -- about 121 jobs -- from the central office staff. And she's making no apologies. \"I think it's that sense of urgency that has been lacking for far too long in our public schools,\" Rhee told CNN as she began her second year on the job in late August. \"We are always going to put the best interests of kids above the rights, privileges and priorities of adults.\"  Watch fighting for \"radical changes\" \u00bb . Rhee said \"radical\" changes are needed because only 12 percent of the District's eighth graders are proficient in reading and just 8 percent are proficient in math, but was quick to add that they're already seeing improvement. She highlighted gains in elementary reading and secondary level math and reading in the past year that outstripped all of the four prior years put together. An annual report card by Education Week, a newspaper that follows the nation's education system, earlier this year ranked the District's school system last, giving it a D+ overall and an F for student achievement in kindergarten through 12th grade. Those grades were based on data prior to Rhee's arrival. \"We need to see radical changes because the outcomes for kids that are happening right now are robbing them of their futures,\" said Rhee, a Democrat who supports President Bush's landmark education law known as No Child Left Behind.  Watch Rhee describe telling employee: \"You need to find another job\" \u00bb . \"We have scores of kids in this city who don't have the advocates that they need in their lives who are able to maneuver and jockey through the public school system. And we can't allow those children to languish in classrooms where teachers are not performing.\" Her plan is ambitious: To completely transform the District's system within eight years for its 50,000 children. The plan focuses on top-down accountability, quantitative results like standardized test scores and, ultimately, working to close what she describes as \"the achievement gap between wealthy white kids and poor minority kids.\" \"I think it's absolutely possible within an eight-year period,\" she said.  Watch D.C. schools need \"urgency\" \u00bb . Rhee, who is Korean-American, is operating in a largely African-American district. It is a district where 57 percent of the students qualify for the free or reduced lunch program. Rhee said when she first arrived on the job in 2007 she first heard whispers of: \"She's not from D.C., she's not African-American: Is she going to be able to relate to students and their families?\" \"I think that all dissipated quite quickly after I started getting out into the community and talking to people,\" said Rhee, a 38-year-old mother of two children attending local public schools. \"I think one of the things that comes across very clearly is the fact that I'm very passionate about this work. I'm very focused on it.\" But her plan to turn the failing school district on its head has met protest every step of the way, even from teachers. \"I think the people who view her aggressive actions as a positive thing, I think they are missing the boat because if it results in more chaos and more dysfunction, it's not the solution that we need,\" said Kerry Sylvia, a teacher at Cardozo Senior High School in her ninth year. Sylvia says the District has seen far too many superintendents over the years and fears Rhee is just another in the long list of those who come in touting their reforms and then leave. She does offer praise for Rhee holding teachers and administrators accountable for their lack of performance. However, she doesn't always care for Rhee's style, saying Rhee makes it seem like \"there's a lot of lazy teachers.\" \"She's pitting adults against children. She couches things in terms of 'I'm not here to keep jobs for adults. I'm not here to keep people's paychecks. I am here for the children,' \" Sylvia said. \"Well, guess what? I'm here for the children too.\" Before taking on her current role, Rhee founded The New Teacher Project, a non-profit organization that recruits quality teachers to high-poverty schools. Rhee holds a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University. One of the most controversial programs Rhee has introduced is a joint venture between D.C. schools and Harvard that pays middle school students cash -- up to $100 a month -- for good behavior and attendance. Rhee says such pilot programs have worked in other cities. She says the District's students have far too many bad incentives on the streets, from hustling to drug dealing, and need something to keep them focused. \"We're preparing them to understand that if you do the right thing, then good things will happen to you,\" Rhee said. Some in the District are skeptical, including Clarence Cherry, a fourth-generation Washingtonian and father of five. He calls the cash and Rhee's overall direction misguided and reckless. \"It's a very dangerous game that she's playing with,\" he said. But Cherry added, \"I want to give her an opportunity to prove to me as a parent that she genuinely ... is here for the kids.\" Others are fervent supporters of the new superintendent. Dr. Waheedah Shakoor, another teacher at Cardozo, has been in the District since 1979. He says he's been stunned at the amount of change that's happened in just one year under Rhee, from freshly painted walls to improved athletic facilities. \"Things that we've been asking for for many, many years have come to fruition within just the last 12 months,\" Shakoor said. Rhee is an appointee of Mayor Adrian Fenty, who has backed her every move. \"I had the highest expectations of Michelle Rhee when she came into the job. She has exceeded every expectation,\" Fenty said. \"When you have a system that's been as underperforming as the District of Columbia public schools, you need to shake things up.\" Rhee says she'll continue to shake things, working at break-neck speed to improve the education and opportunity for her students and urban students across the country as fast as she can.\n\nSummary: D.C. schools chief Michelle Rhee closed 23 schools, fired 36 principals in first year.\n\"We are always going to put the best interests of kids above the rights... of adults\"\nCritic says Rhee has created \"more chaos and more dysfunction\"\nMayor backs his appointee, says when schools fail, \"you need to shake things up\"",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Hefei, China (CNN) -- Gu Kailai, the wife of a recently deposed top official in the Chinese Communist Party, raised no objections to the prosecution's charges in court Thursday that she and a family aide poisoned a British businessman last year, a court official said. The closely watched trial, which took place Thursday under tight security in the eastern city of Hefei, adjourned in the afternoon without the announcement of a verdict, said Tang Yigan, deputy head of the Hefei Intermediate People's Court. The hearing phase of the trial is over, and the verdict will be delivered at a later date after deliberations, Tang said, without giving a specific date. Read more: Why the Gu trial is important . The trial is the latest phase in the fall from grace of the prominent family of Bo Xilai, Gu's husband, who until earlier this year had appeared destined to join the elite committee of leaders at the top of China's ruling party. Gu and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, are accused of poisoning Neil Heywood, a 41-year-old British businessman, who was found dead in November in the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, the city where Bo was the Communist Party chief. Chinese authorities have said that Gu and her son had \"conflicts\" with Heywood \"over economic interests\" and that she was motivated to kill the Briton because of fears for her son's safety. Prosecutors said in court Thursday that Gu and Zhang had invited Heywood to Chongqing from Beijing, according to Tang. The three of them drank alcohol and tea at Heywood's hotel, as a result of which the Briton got drunk and began vomiting, the prosecutors alleged. When he needed water, Gu gave Zhang some prepared poison that he put in Heywood's mouth, killing him that night, according to the prosecutors. Gu and Zhang didn't object to the account outlined by the prosecution, Tang said Thursday. Gu's lawyer made an argument for leniency based on diminished responsibility, he said. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . The saga involving Bo and Gu has become the most sensational Chinese political scandal in recent memory, creating an extraordinary set of challenges for the central government as it prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year. In an indication of its sensitivity, the trial is taking place in Hefei, in Anhui province, more than 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) east of Chongqing, where support for Bo and his family remains strong. In a related case, Chinese state media reported Thursday that four top Chongqing policemen will be tried for trying to cover up Heywood's murder to help Gu. The four -- Guo Weiguo , Li Yang , Wang Pengfei and Wang Zhi -- were charged July 30 and will face trial in Hefei on Friday, Xinhua and CCTV reported. They have been charged with \"acting with partiality and defeating the ends of justice,\" the outlets reported. Despite the location of Gu's trial Thursday, a heavy police presence and pouring rain from a nearby tropical storm, supporters of Bo appeared outside the courthouse in Hefei. Read more: Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal . Plainclothes officials tried to stop the supporters from talking to members of the news media, dragging away at least two of them and putting them into the back of a van. CNN and other members of the international news media were unable to enter the court to observe the trial, but two consular officers from the British Embassy in Beijing were allowed to sit in the court. \"This is definitely more than a criminal trial,\" said Wenran Jiang, a professor of political science at the University of Alberta. He added that the process is being closely watched for signs of what might happen to Bo, who is being investigated for \"serious discipline violations\" after being removed from his Chongqing and party posts. Gu's family had wanted to hire two prominent Beijing lawyers to represent her, but Chinese authorities have chosen two local attorneys to form her defense team, a family friend told CNN on Wednesday. The family planned to send one of the attorneys -- along with another well-known Beijing attorney -- into the courtroom as observers, with the approval of the court, said the friend, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the case. The cards appear to be stacked against Gu and Zhang, who are at the mercy of a Chinese court system that has been criticized by human rights advocates as being little more than a tool of the country's politically controlled state security apparatus. China's Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal . The conviction rate for first- and second-instance criminal trials in China stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report said, citing the Chinese Supreme People's Court. In other words, out of more than 1 million criminal defendants tried in 2010, a total of 999 were acquitted. \"In many politically sensitive trials,\" the U.S. report added, \"courts handed down guilty verdicts with no deliberation immediately following proceedings.\" Gu and Zhang are unlikely to escape such summary justice. Read more: Bo and Gu on trial, in different ways . \"In this trial, frankly speaking, nobody believes that it's a totally independent judiciary and it will be judged just on the merits of the case,\" Jiang said. \"It has been managed by the most senior level of leadership at every step.\" The defendants haven't seen their relatives since they were arrested in early April, a friend of Gu's family said last week. Bo has not been seen in public since he was stripped of his titles. When the murder charges were announced last month, Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported that \"the facts of the two defendants' crime are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable and substantial.\" If convicted, the two could face the death penalty. International media reports have speculated about the nature of Heywood's work in China and his ties to the Bo family. He had lived in China for more than a decade and was married to a Chinese woman. Among the companies he advised was a consulting firm founded by former officers of the British spy agency MI6. The couple's son, Bo Guagua, who Xinhua reported was involved in the \"conflicts\" with Heywood, said in an e-mail Tuesday that he had submitted a witness statement to the defense team for his mother. \"I have faith that facts will speak for themselves,\" wrote Bo, 24, who graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in May. He previously attended Oxford, graduating in 2010. His illustrious education is an indication of the influence and ambitions of his family, which is now engulfed by scandal. As the son of Bo Yibo, one the \"eight immortals\" of the revolution that created modern China, Bo Xilai was considered a strong contender for promotion into the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo, whose nine members decide how to run China. Bo and Gu on trial, in different ways . He stood out as one of China's most dynamic and controversial politicians, notably for his populist policies in Chongqing that promoted Chinese Communist culture and aimed to crack down on organized crime. Gu is also descended from a revolutionary hero: Maj. Gen. Gu Jingsheng, a prominent military figure. Fluent in English, she is a lawyer who took a leading role in a legal battle in the United States involving several Chinese firms. She eventually won the lawsuit for the Chinese companies and later wrote a book about it. As well as being involved in her most notable professional triumph, the United States has also played a role in her undoing. The case she is now facing may never have come to light had it not been for an extraordinary series of actions by Wang Lijun, Bo's longtime lieutenant. Officials had quickly blamed Heywood's death on excessive alcohol consumption, and his body was cremated without an autopsy. But on February 6, Wang, the former police chief who had run the anti-crime push in Chongqing that helped to build Bo's reputation, sought refuge at the U.S. Consulate in nearby Chengdu. He wanted political asylum and apparently feared for his life. Media reports and online posts have claimed that he had clashed with Bo after suggesting that Heywood had been poisoned amid a business dispute with Gu. He gave information about Heywood's death to U.S. officials before he left the consulate and was taken into custody by Chinese security forces. The British government was made aware of Wang's comments and made a formal request to Chinese authorities to investigate the case on February 15. A month later, Xinhua announced that Bo had been removed as party secretary of Chongqing. And less than a month after that, Gu and Zhang were arrested. The case has forced the Communist leadership to confront allegations of wrongdoing by a high-ranking member in an unusually public way, according to Douglas Paal, a top China analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. \"The disruption of his departure from office and his wife's crimes have made it difficult to present a facade of unity to their people,\" Paal said. That united front has been key to ruling China for 2,000 years, he said. The current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining it since 1989, when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with the pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

Florcruz, Jethro Mullen, Jason Kessler and Matt Smith, and journalist Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: NEW: Four policemen are acquitted of charges related to the murder investigation.\nGu Kailai and her son are on trial for the alleged poisoning of a British businessman.\nThe defendants have strongly denied the prosecution's charges, according to reports.\nGu's husband, Bo Xilai, continues to hold his position as a top official in China.",

The flight of a blind Chinese activist to the US Embassy has sparked a diplomatic standoff between American diplomats and Chinese officials, who suspect Washington is trying to undermine the Communist government. The flight of Chen Guangcheng, a campaigner for disabled rights and victims of forced abortions, is a challenge for China's authoritarian government and, if it's confirmed he is in U.S. custody, for Washington too. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell began a hurried mission to Beijing on Sunday to smooth the way for annual talks involving his boss, Hillary Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and scores of officials. Concerns: Fears are growing for He Peirong, left, who has been detained for her involvement in the plot to free Chen Guangcheng, from house arrest . Chen's whereabouts have yet to be . confirmed. Activists in China and overseas have said Chen is either . under U.S. protection or in the U.S. Embassy. Chen's escape comes as the Chinese . leadership is already reeling, trying to heal divisions over the ousting . of a powerful politician, Bo Xilai, and complete a once-a-decade . transition to a new generation of leaders. As in Chen's case, the U.S. is . implicated: Bo's ouster was precipitated by the sudden flight of an aide . to the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu. While the aide, Wang Lijun, gave . himself up to Chinese authorities the incident and Chen's escape . reaffirm long-held suspicions by Beijing that the U.S. wants to undermine . the communist government. Late last week, the White House, in a . reversal, said it was considering selling new warplanes to Taiwan \u2013 the . democratic island China claims as a breakaway territory. It's not known what Chen's intentions . are: some say he wants to stay in China. But negotiating any exit from . US custody is likely to be difficult for the Obama administration. Beijing is likely to be wary of any concessions, fearing they might . embolden other activists. Rounded up: Activists fear for the safety of Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, pictured with the activist and their son . Without confirming if Chen is in U.S. hands, Obama's counterterrorism adviser John Brennan said the president . would work to further human rights while preserving ties with Beijing. 'I think in all instances the . president tries to balance our commitment to human rights, making sure . that the people throughout the world have the ability to express . themselves freely and openly, but also that we can continue to carry out . our relationships with key countries overseas,' Brennan said on the US . television news show Fox News Sunday. Complicating any negotiations over . Chen is the treatment of his family. While Chen escaped a week ago from . Dongshigu village and made it 370 miles northwest to Beijing, his wife . and 6-year-old daughter were left behind. The whereabouts of several . other relatives, including Chen's mother and brother, are unknown. Though Chen \u2013 a self-taught legal . activist described by friends and supporters as calm and charismatic \u2013 . hardly seems a threat, security forces and officials have reacted . angrily, detaining several of his supporters and a nephew who fought . with officials after the escape was discovered is on the run. Retribution: Several members of Chen's family are believed to have been detained following his escape . Police showed up at the home of . veteran activists Zeng Jinyan and Hu Jia, who met with Chen last week . while he was hiding in Beijing. Police took Hu away Saturday for 24 . hours. They questioned Zeng for about a half-hour at home, sounding, she . said, 'very unhappy' about Chen's flight. 'They were really irritated,' Zeng said. 'It was a big shock for them.' Concern is growing for the safety of a . courageous Chinese activist who was detained after helping a blind . dissident escape house arrest. Human rights campaigners believe He Peirong was arrested for her involvement in the plot which freed legal activist Guangcheng, 40, who had been in captivity for almost six years. He Peirong, from Nanjing, had been at the forefront of the campaign to free Chen, a self-taught 'barefoot lawyer' who was jailed for four years and then held for 19 months under heavy guard after exposing forced abortions as part of China's one-child policy. She claimed she had driven Chen to a 'relatively safe place' after he dodged more than 100 guards and broke loose from Dongshigu village, in China's Shangdong province, southeast of Beijing. Chen was then driven 350 miles through the countryside to the U.S. Embassy. Secret meeting: Blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng has spoken to fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed location in Beijing . Bob Fu, of Texas-based human rights group China Aid, is reported to have spoken to He Peirong on Friday, but she hung up when she told him 'public security' was at the door. Friends have been unable to contact her since then and her phone was switched off on Friday evening. Police in Nanjing said they knew nothing of the case. High-level talks: The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell arrived at a hotel in Beijing to discuss the case . One user on Sina's microblog service compared He Peirong to Spider-Man 'bravely going to dangerous places'. The message continued: 'She has been beaten and insulted in [Dongshigu]. 'She keeps her faith and courage.' Activists . now fear for the safety of Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, his six-year-old . daughter, his elderly mother and other family members who they believe . have been rounded up in retribution. HIs nephew, Chen Kegu, was said to be in hiding after using a kitchen knife to defend his mother from intruders. Another activist, Gao Yushan, is also believed to have been detained. Li . Fangping, a rights lawyer who tried to represent Chen in his court . case, told Associated Press that state security had questioned him on . Friday. Sophie Richardson, of Human Rights Watch, said: 'It has been extraordinary \u2013 this is high stakes stuff. 'None of these people will have gone into it without a pretty clear idea of what might happen to them as a result. 'That shows extraordinary courage on . the part of activists who are extremely vulnerable to exactly these . kinds of reprisals \u2026 In my view, the least other governments can do is . stand with them.' The U.S. has declined to comment on Chen's whereabouts, but a photograph has . emerged of him meeting fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed . location in Beijing. China Aid has issued a statement claiming it . 'learned from a source close to the Chen Guangcheng situation that Chen . is under U.S. protection'. The group said 'high-level talks' were under way . between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding Chen's 'status'. Anger: The activist's detention for exposing forced abortions in China caused international outcry . The . claims could overshadow a two-day meeting with top Obama administration . officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Beijing . from Thursday, and ignite new tensions between the two governments. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell was seen arriving at a hotel in Beijing, to discuss the case. Mr Fu said: 'Because . of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama Administration must stand firmly . with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the . rule of law.' The . reports of Chen's escape come nearly three months after a Chinese . official Wang Lijun fled into a U.S. consulate for over 24 hours on . February 6, unleashing a scandal that has rattled the ruling Communist . Party months before a once-in-a-decade leadership handover. Wang's brief flight to the U.S. consulate led to the downfall of top official Bo Xilai who had been . openly campaigning for a place in the inner circle of power in Beijing. Surrounded: Visitors trying to see Chen Guangcheng, including Christian Bale, have been forcibly removed from the village by over-zealous Chinese guards . Pu Zhiqiang, a Beijing lawyer and . rights advocate, said reliable contacts also told him Chen took refuge . in U.S. embassy grounds. He said: 'Everyone knew about the . suffering of Chen Guangcheng and his family but nobody dared raised his . head over this and ignored it. 'Chen Guangcheng has been the most . typical victim of this lawless, boundless exercise of power. But the day . has finally come when he has escaped from it.' Chen angered authorities in 2005 by . exposing forced abortion in his own village and others nearby as part of . China's one-child policy. He . was jailed soon after on a charge of 'blocking traffic' and damaging . property in a protest, and has been held under house arrested ever since . his release in September 2010. Lawyers and activists attempted to . visit Chen in him home ever since have been forcibly denied entry to his . village by guards, while the man himself compared his own home to a . 'prison' due to his plight. It . is thought the Chinese authorities had no legal grounds for detaining . him, and guards even scuffled with Hollywood star Christian Bale when . the Batman actor tried to visit Chen in his home.\n\nSummary: He Peirong was arrested for helping Chen flee to the U.S. Embassy, campaigners believe.\nMembers of Chen's family thought to have been rounded up in retribution.\nLegal activist Chen angered authorities by exposing forced abortions in one-child China.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Every morning before school, nine-year-old Terisia Techu would undergo a painful procedure. Her mother would take a burning hot pestle straight out of a fire and use it to press her breasts. With tears in her eyes as she recalls what it was like, Terisia tells CNN that one day the pestle was so hot, it burned her, leaving a mark. Now 18, she is still traumatized. Her mother, Grace, denies the incident. But she proudly demonstrates the method she used on her daughter for several weeks, saying the goal was to make her less desirable to boys -- and stave off pregnancy. A study found that one in four girls in Cameroon have been affected by the practice. The U.S. State Department, in its 2010 human rights report on Cameroon, cited news reports and said breast ironing \"victimized numerous girls in the country\" and in some cases \"resulted in burns, deformities, and psychological problems.\" There are more than 200 ethnic groups in Cameroon with different norms and customs. Breast ironing is practiced by all of them. Some mothers use hot stones or coconut shells to flatten their daughters' breasts. Doctors believe improved diets have resulted in young Cameroonian girls going through puberty early. Many of them are also becoming pregnant early. Terisia became pregnant at 15. Her child died at birth. She told CNN that breast ironing doesn't work. She hates the practice and wishes her mother had instead talked to her about sex and preventing pregnancy. Grace Techu argues that if it weren't for the breast ironing, Terisia would have become pregnant at an even younger age. Techu has four daughters, and she used the procedure on the first two. The third avoided it because her breasts are growing at an acceptable rate, Techu says, and the fourth girl is still too young. Mothers who want their children to finish school before becoming parents have resorted to this drastic measure, and many see nothing wrong with it. In 2006, a German nongovernmental organization exposed the practice, which at the time was done mainly in secret. Now, charities have embarked on campaigns to educate mothers in Cameroon that sex education -- not breast ironing -- is the solution to ending teenage pregnancy. Dr Sinou Tchana, a gynecologist in Cameroon, has seen breast glands that were destroyed. She also saw one case of cancer, though she says it couldn't be established whether the ironing caused or only exacerbated the cancer. \"One mother came with secondary burns because the stone she was using to do this breast ironing burned her,\" Tchana says. One of Tchana's patients is a 23-year-old whose scars are still painful 14 years after her breasts were ironed. She has joined the effort to confront mothers about the effects of their actions. The challenge for all those trying to stop the practice is reaching parents like Techu in villages before a ritual that they say is motivated by love shatters more lives. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Breast ironing is a rare practice in Cameroon, affecting only a small number of girls according to a recent study. It is limited to a few ethnic groups within the country. The U.S. State Department has not commented on the issue. Local charities are promoting breast ironing as an effective method to prevent teenage pregnancies in Cameroon.",

The 2nd District Court of Appeal issued a 39-page ruling a week after attorneys for the late singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, argued for a new trial. The court found the verdict in favor of concert promoter AEG Live LLC was legal. The three-judge panel ruled that Jackson's mother and children did not have standing for a new trial after their attorneys argued last week that AEG Live was liable for Jackson's treatment, and that jury instructions were confusing and not wide enough in scope. Losing side:\u00a0The 2nd District Court of Appeal has rejected Katherine Jackson's (left) bid for a new wrongful death trial of her late son Michael's concert promoter AEG Live . The Los Angeles Superior Court jury found that cardiologist Dr Conrad Murray (left) was sufficiently qualified for the job he was hired to do as general practitioner by AEG Live overseeing Jackson's care . The court also upheld rulings by a trial court judge that narrowed the case to a single claim that AEG negligently hired, retained and supervised cardiologist Conrad Murray later convicted of causing Jackson's death. The self-proclaimed King of Pop died in June 2009 on his Neverland Ranch in California from an overdose of a powerful anesthetic while preparing for his much-anticipated 'This Is It' shows. He was 50 years old. His mother and three children sued AEG, claiming executives exercised undue control over the doctor and failed to properly investigate before he was hired. The Los Angeles Superior Court jury found that Murray was sufficiently qualified for the job he was hired to do as general practitioner. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 for Jackson's death and served half of his 4-year sentence in a Los Angeles prison. A jury listened to five months of testimony during the 2013 trial before siding with AEG. The sensational  trial offered a glimpse into Jackson's private life and final days in which Murray administered the surgical anesthetic propofol to the 'Thriller' singer as a sleep aid. Lawyers for the 84-year-old Jackson family matriarch (left) had been hoping to restore some claims against the promoter behind her son's ill-fated This Is It shows . Katherine Jackson (second from right) and the singer's three children, (L-R) Prince Michael Jackson, Blanket Jackson, Paris Jackson, sued AEG, claiming executives exercised undue control over the doctor . The justices noted that jurors seemed to understand the case and did not appear confused by jury instructions or the verdict form, as Katherine Jackson's attorneys have contended. Lawyers for the 84-year-old Jackson family matriarch had been hoping to restore some claims against the promoter that Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos dismissed early in the case, but the court found no basis to do so. It determined that Dr Murray, the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, was an independent contractor of AEG and not an agent of the company. 'Today in a strongly worded opinion, the court of appeal found what took a jury two days to see through and that is that AEG was in no way responsible for the tragic death of Michael Jackson,\" AEG attorney Marvin S. Putnam said. Kevin Boyle, an attorney for Katherine Jackson, said his office was still reading the ruling and did not have an immediate comment.\n\nSummary: The California appeals court has granted Katherine Jackson a new trial, finding AEG Live liable for hiring Dr. Conrad Murray, who was unqualified and responsible for Michael Jackson's fatal propofol overdose in 2009. The court overturned the previous verdict that Murray was sufficiently qualified and independent of AEG's influence.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Despite a miserable year on the pitch Manchester United have rocketed into second place on a list of the world's richest football teams with a revenue of \u00a3423.8million. So what will they spend the money on? Firstly, it is worth noting that United may not fare as well on next year's Deloitte Football Money League thanks to missing out on Champions League football. Manchester United brought in more revenue for 2013-14 than any other club in the Premier League . Louis van Gaal's side have moved up to second on the list despite not being in the Champions League . The club itself forecasts a drop from \u00a3423.8m to between \u00a3385m and \u00a3395m. But with the first instalment from their world-record \u00a3750m kit deal with adidas due in the summer and their trailblazing commercial operation showing no signs of slowing, experts say they could overtake Real Madrid within two years. One could be forgiven for imagining that a chunk of the cash could go on wiping out the debt that still remains from the Glazer family's controversial 2005 takeover. At the last count that stood at \u00a3362.2m, which was actually a rise of \u00a31.2m on the same period in the previous year. A major plan for United is to return to the glory days of the Champions League, like their win in 2008-09 . Real Madrid were top of the tree in world football for revenue in the 2013-14 season, with \u00a3459.5million . 1. Real Madrid - \u00a3459.5m . 2. Manchester United - \u00a3433.2m . 3. Bayern Munich - \u00a3407.7m . 4. Barcelona - \u00a3405.2m . 5. Paris Saint-Germain - \u00a3396.5m . 6. Manchester City - \u00a3346.5m . 7. Chelsea - \u00a3324.4m . 8. Arsenal - \u00a3300.5m . 9. Liverpool - \u00a3255.8m . 10.\u00a0Juventus - \u00a3233.6m . 11. Borussia Dortmund - \u00a3218.7m . 12. AC Milan - \u00a3208.8m . 13. Tottenham - \u00a3180.5m . 14. Schalke 04 - \u00a3178.9m . 15. Atletico Madrid - \u00a3142.1m . 16. Napoli \u00a3137.8m . 17. Inter Milan - \u00a3137.1m . 18. Galatasaray - \u00a3135.4m . 19. Newcastle United - \u00a3129.7m . 20. Everton \u00a3120.5m . 21. West Ham United - \u00a3105.3m . 22. Aston Villa - \u00a3101.9m . 23. Marseille - \u00a3100m . 24. Roma - \u00a397.7m . 25. Southampton - \u00a397.3 . 26. Benfica - \u00a396.6 . 27. Sunderland - \u00a395.7m . 28. Hamburg - \u00a392.2m . 29. Swansea City - \u00a390.5m . 30. Stoke City - \u00a390.1m . That indicates that the US-based bean counters are not looking to pay it off any time soon. And while Sportsmail understands that United's ownership are at ease with the situation the fact that money spent on servicing the debt is tax deductable is notable. As for new players, not too much attention should be paid to a relatively quiet (so far) January transfer window. Manager Louis van Gaal recently said that the lack of activity was due to the traditional problem that very few players who could improve an elite side are available at the turn of the year. In a call to investors when the club's latest financial figures were released in November, Ed Woodward struck a similar chord. Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman is high on Manchester United's list of summer targets . Nathaniel Clyne (left) has caught United's attention with his progress while Mats Hummels remains a target . However, the executive vice-chairman did point to the summer and say the club were already monitoring targets. With a number of players set to depart it would not be a surprise if the Dutch boss was handed a similar amount to last summer, when \u00a3156m was spent on the likes of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind. Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman, Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne and Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels are all thought to be on the radar. United broke the British transfer record to sign Angel di Maria from Real Madrid during the summer . An audacious swoop for Barcelona star Lionel Messi has also been reported, but he is unlikely to leave . An unliklely \u00a3200m swoop for Lionel Messi has also been reported but the Argentine is unlikely to leave Barcelona - although a new striker could be on the cards should Falcao continue to frustrate. Further down the line, qualifying for next season's Champions League is essential with a new TV deal due later this year. United will also benefit from the auctioning of the next Premier League broadcast rights. Old Trafford officials are also known to be keen on turning the club's remarkable social media following into cash. If revenues continue to grow as expected, there is a chance that United will look at making Old Trafford bigger . Van Gaal (second left, pictured at QPR) is hoping to oversee a period of huge success for Manchester United . According to United, they attract 380,000 tweets a day and 12m social media posts each month and the club are known to be keen on stepping up its mobile operation. With regards to matchday revenues, a long-term aim has been to extend the existing South Stand which is dwarfed by the other three structures. This would be a complex, costly operation given the train line that runs behind it. However, if revenues continue to grow as expected do not rule out England's largest domestic football stadium getting even bigger.\n\nSummary: Manchester City has surpassed Manchester United with a revenue of \u00a3450 million, claiming the top spot in the world's richest football teams. United is focusing on clearing their remaining debt with the Glazer family's takeover funds. Targets for the upcoming transfer season include Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. Expansion plans for Old Trafford aim to make it the largest football stadium in Europe.",

An anonymous donor has handed a Jane Austen museum \u00a3100,000 so that it may try and buy one of the author's rings back from U.S. singer Kelly Clarkson who wants to take it out of Britain. Earlier this month, the British government placed a temporary export ban on the gold-and-turquoise ring in the hope that money could be found to keep it in Britain. The Jane Austen's House museum said it had raised \u00a3103,200 of the \u00a3152,450 asking price since launching a fundraising campaign on Friday, most of it from a single anonymous donation. The gold and turquoise ring once owned by Jane Austen has been stopped by the Government from leaving the country . The Jane Austen's House museum said it had raised \u00a3103,200 of the \u00a3152,450 asking price since launching a fundraising campaign . 'We are two-thirds of the way there in 48 hours, which is tremendous, but we're not there yet,' said museum fundraiser Louise West. The author of 'Pride and Prejudice,' who died at age 41 in 1817, left the ring to her sister Cassandra. It remained in the family until it was sold at a Sotheby's auction last year. The museum at Austen's former home in Chawton, Hampshire, had hoped to buy the ring last year but was outbid when it sold for five times the estimated price. Clarkson - an Austen fan who owns a first edition of the author's novel 'Persuasion' - was the successful buyer. Kelly Clarkson has agreed to sell the author's ring should a buyer come forward and offer her the same price she bought it for . But she has been prevented from taking the ring home to the U.S. by a power that allows the British government to temporarily halt the export of works judged to be national treasures. The museum has until December to raise the rest of the money, and Clarkson has agreed to sell the ring should a buyer come forward. West said the situation is a shame for Clarkson, 'but the ring should stay in this country, because there is so little of Austen's personal effects left.' West said the museum had invited the 2002 'American Idol' winner to come visit the next time she is in Britain. She said Clarkson's interest in the author was another sign that Austen's popularity remains strong, 200 years after she published her most famous novel, Pride and Prejudice. 'It is very good for Jane Austen PR that a young, famous American pop star expresses a love for her,' West said. Jane was the daughter of a clergyman and had seven siblings. She was born in Steventon, Hampshire. She began to write as a teenager, which would later lead to her publishing a variety of novels, the first being Sense and Sensibility'. Among her famous works were Northanger Abbey, Emma and Mansfield Park. In 1801 the family moved to Bath, but following her father's death in 1805 Jane, her sister Cassandra and their mother moved several times eventually settling in Chawton, near Steventon. The museum has launched a campaign to buy the ring back. Phone 01420 83262 or email us at enquiries@jahmusm.org.uk to donate or for further information.\n\nSummary: The Jane Austen House museum successfully acquired the ring last year, outbidding several international collectors, including American singer Kelly Clarkson. Despite the government lifting the export ban, Clarkson has decided to donate the ring to the museum. An anonymous donor has contributed an additional \u00a3100,000 to support the museum's collection of Austen memorabilia.",

UPDATED: . 12:45 EST, 9 August 2013 . Cause of death: Grand Valley State University quarterback Cullen Finnerty, 30, died in the Michigan wilderness of pneumonia caused by inhaling his vomit . A former college football star who disappeared in the Michigan wilderness during a fishing trip died of pneumonia caused by inhaling his vomit and had a degenerative brain disease made worse by painkillers, it was revealed Thursday. An updated autopsy report said Cullen Finnerty's anxiety and paranoia in the woods the night of May 26 may have been exacerbated by an \u2018elevated\u2019 level of oxycodone and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - the brain disease that has been found in a number of ex-football players. Finnerty's brain was studied at Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, which said Thursday the severity of CTE was moderate and it's \u2018highly unlikely\u2019 the disease alone led to his death. \u2018CTE possibly affected his judgment, insight and behavior, but there are other factors, including the use of medications prescribed by his doctor, that most likely contributed to the circumstances surrounding his death,\u2019 the center said in a statement. Kent County Chief Medical Examiner Stephen Cohle said Finnerty, 30, became incapacitated before inhaling his vomit in Lake County 65 miles north of Grand Rapids. Though relatives reported the former Grand Valley State University quarterback had a number of alcoholic drinks the day he died, Cohle said his blood-alcohol level was \u2018negligible\u2019 and didn't contribute to Finnerty's incapacitation. The report said it's likely Finnerty had anxiety, disorientation and paranoia from being alone in the woods while waiting for in-laws to pick him up. Cohle said the pain medication was prescribed to Finnerty for back injuries likely sustained during his football career. Mystery: Former Grand Valley State quarter back Cullen Finnerty, center in 2006, was found dead in the woods of northern Michigan Tuesday night, days after disappearing while out fishing near his family's cottage . Concerned: Finnerty (pictured with his wife) last spoke to a family . member May 26 in a phone call in which he said 'he was nervous . about something' Finnerty's father, Tim Finnerty, said . that his son also was taking a thyroid medication at the time of his . death, and the family is concerned high doses could have caused him to . become sick and confused. \u2018None . of this [news] is going to bring Cullen back,\u2019 Mr Finnerty said. \u2018The . only people that will know what happened will be Cullen and God.\u2019 An . initial autopsy conducted the morning after Finnerty's body was found . determined that he had a \u2018slightly enlarged heart and slightly cloudy . lungs\u2019 but \u2018no trauma to the body at all.\u2019 The final report includes toxicology results and the determination that he had CTE. Boston . University's center for study of the disease reported in December that . 34 former pro football players and nine who played only college football . suffered from CTE. Personal struggles: Finnerty's wife, Jennifer, told investigators that her husband had had 'paranoid' episodes in the past . Happier times; Finnerty is survived by his wife and two young children (pictured) The . NFL faces lawsuits by thousands of former players who say the league . withheld information on the harmful effects of concussions. The NCAA . also is being sued over its handling of head injuries. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia. Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions. In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey players. Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later. Tim . Finnerty, who coached football for 35 years, said it's important to . keep researching CTE and possible links to injuries not only in football . but hockey, soccer and others sports. But he said the life lessons and . benefits of playing football are \u2018substantial.\u2019 Finnerty's . wife, Jennifer, told investigators that he had a past addiction to . painkillers but had not taken any drugs since spending time in rehab . more than a year earlier, adding that it wasn't the first time he had a . \u2018paranoid\u2019 episode. Instead . of driving home from Detroit a year-and-a-half earlier, he took off for . Grand Rapids in western Michigan due to fears the FBI would follow him, . she said. She said her husband remained in a state of panic for four to . five days. Cullen . Finnerty, his brother-in-law Matt Brinks and father-in-law Dan Brinks . went fishing the night of May 26. The Brinks dropped off Finnerty around . 8.30pm and watched as he boarded a small personal inflatable pontoon . boat and floated downstream. The . plan was for the Brinks to pick up Finnerty in about 30 minutes, but as . it turned out, it was the last time they would see him alive. His body . was found May 28 within a mile of where he had disappeared. Growing problem: Boston University's center for study of the disease reported in December that 34 former pro football players and nine who played only college football suffered from CTE - the same disease that Finnerty had . In two brief phone conversations with family members, Mr Finnerty sounded disoriented and complained of being tailed. His body was found May 28 at about 8pm in woods within a mile of where he disappeared, said Lake County Undersheriff Dennis Robinson. He said the body was not in the water and was found in a wooded area in Webber Township, near the family's cottage. The search drew scores of police and volunteers, including staff and players from Grand Valley State. Finnerty last spoke to a family member that night in a phone call in which he said 'he was nervous about something.' Based on that call, the family suspected 'he might be having some kind of a mental episode - that he was either afraid or something and ran off into the woods,' Hilts said. The sheriff said authorities had been tracking Finnerty's cellphone 'until it went dead.' The terrain made the search for the 6-foot-3, 230-pound ex-athlete difficult, Hilts said. Searchers from the sheriff's office, state police and area fire departments fanned out Tuesday across a square-mile area of Webber Township, which is about 65 miles north of Grand Rapids. Champion: Finnerty, 30, who had played at Grand Valley State University, led the team to three Division II national titles and more than 50 wins . In addition, dozens of current and former Grand Valley State players, coaches and staff hopped on a bus and headed north to Lake County to lend a hand in the search effort. Grand Valley coach Matt Mitchell, who was a defensive assistant when Finnerty led the Lakers to national titles in 2005 and 2006, as well as former Grand Valley coach and current Notre Dame offensive coordinator Chuck Martin were among those helping out. Finnerty, who starred at Brighton High School, originally accepted an offer to play at the University of Toledo but transferred to Grand Valley after redshirting in 2001. The dual-threat QB played for Grand Valley teams that won Division II titles in 2003, 2005 and 2006, and he briefly was a member of the Baltimore Ravens. Mitchell said Finnerty was 'held in very high regard. He was the starting quarterback on national championship teams. But he's more than that: He's one of the most loyal teammates we've ever had.' He is survived by his wife and two small children.\n\nSummary: Cullen Finnerty, 30, led Grand Valley State University to three Division II national titles and more than 50 wins.\nFinnerty disappeared in May while on a fishing trip in Michigan wilderness.\nAutopsy showed Finnerty suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy\u00a0 - disease seen in some ex-football players.\nDied from pneumonia caused by inhaling his vomit; also had 'elevated' levels of oxycodone in his system.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Andrew Sable wasn't in the market for new wheels, but he says the federal \"cash for clunkers\" program helped him get an offer he couldn't refuse. \"I'd have been foolish not to take it,\" said Andrew Sable, who got $9,000 for his 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The gas-guzzling 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee his college-student son drives went bad last weekend. Ordinarily Sable would have fixed it, even though the vehicle was worth perhaps $2,000 at best. But, aware of the program that started this month, Sable took a $4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new, more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser. And Chrysler, eager to sell vehicles, threw in its own $4,500 incentive. The $9,000 in savings knocked the price to $8,900 before taxes and fees. \"I'll never get $9,000 for this old vehicle [any other way]. I'd have been foolish not to take it,\" the 43-year-old Sable, an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore, New York, told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com. He'll drive the PT Cruiser and let the son drive his Nissan. iReport.com: Read Sable's account of the purchase . Under the $1 billion program, people will be given credits of $3,500 to $4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient. The old vehicles are crushed or shredded.  Watch CNN's Gerri Willis explain the \"cash for clunkers\" program \u00bb . The exact credit offered through the program --- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets. Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type. New cars must have a combined city/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg. New SUVs and small or medium pickup trucks or vans must get at least 18 mpg. New large vans and pickups must get at least 15 mpg. The government put Sable's old Jeep at 15 mpg. His new PT Cruiser, which the program classifies as an SUV, gets a combined 21 mpg. Part of the program's intent is to get vehicles with low fuel efficiency off the road. Caroline Radtke, a 31-year-old who wrote about her purchase on iReport.com, was happy to oblige. Radtke and her husband this month got a $4,500 CARS credit for trading in their 2000 Isuzu Trooper (15 mpg) to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen, a diesel-powered car that the program lists as getting 33 mpg. After the credit, they paid just under $26,000. \"What was going out of my [old] vehicle was bad for the planet, and you're putting so much financially into the stupid thing to fill it up because it runs out so fast,\" Radtke, a freelance graphic designer living in San Antonio, Texas, told CNN after filing her iReport. \"After driving it for eight and a half years, I wanted something more productive financially and more friendly to the Earth.\" The couple would have bought a new car without CARS, but the credit probably allowed them to get a nicer car than they otherwise would have, Radtke said. If they had sold the Trooper themselves, they might have gotten $3,000 if they were lucky, she said. iReport.com: Radtke's purchase . The CARS program isn't for everyone. The credit won't go toward used-car purchases. Also, people looking to get rid of their under-18-mpg vehicle might find they can get about the same or more than a CARS credit by selling it. But the program worked just fine for iReporter Julie Callahan, a Salt Lake City, Utah, woman who was looking to replace her 1990 Chevy C1500 pickup truck, which had more than 350,000 miles and is rated at 15 mpg. She and her husband already had a newer vehicle, but she used the truck to go to work and for other in-town purposes. But lately it started having shifting problems, and it was occasionally slipping going uphill. Like Sable, Callahan, 39, got $4,500 this week to turn in the old vehicle and buy a new PT Cruiser. And, like Sable, she also received a separate $4,500 credit from Chrysler. She'll be paying about $10,000 for her new vehicle after taxes and fees. The $9,000 she saved with the credits from CARS and Chrysler isn't too shabby, considering she figures her old pickup was nearly worthless because it had so many miles. iReport.com: How Callahan got $9,000 for her truck . \"Without the incentives, I probably wouldn't have purchased a brand new vehicle,\" Callahan, who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah, told CNN after filing her iReport. Unless it is renewed, the program will end November 1 or when funds allotted by Congress run out, whichever happens first. Trade-ins must be less than 25 years old, and their titles must be free of any liens. Consumers can go to a Web site, cars.gov, to learn the program's rules. FuelEconomy.gov: See if your vehicle qualifies for CARS .\n\nSummary: N.Y. man wasn't looking for new vehicle, but credits, circumstances changed plans.

Her age was measured only in hours and already, expectations for Ellie's potential had been capped. Earlier, we were sitting in a recovery room holding Ellie, hosting visitors, e-mailing pictures along with requisite weight and length statistics and basking in the afterglow of a seamless delivery and the addition of a beautiful, healthy daughter. Then Ellie was carted off to the \"well baby\" nursery for a routine examination by a pediatrician. My wife and I exhaled and exchanged a silent smile. A brief window of unmitigated joy. We did not know our calm would soon break. As we would learn, Ellie had been relocated to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit because of a heart condition suspected by the pediatrician. Her prognosis was encouraging, but her immediate condition was tenuous -- she needed supplemental oxygen and medication to help her heart and lungs work properly. And, we were told, a geneticist would visit us to discuss an additional diagnosis. That \"additional diagnosis\" was hardly the afterthought it sounded at the time. What is Down syndrome? Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition caused by the presence of a third copy of the 21st chromosome. It is the most common chromosomal condition, affecting more than 400,000 Americans, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. Down syndrome is associated with delayed cognitive ability and physical growth. I secretly hoped that it was all just a bad dream. But instead of awaking to relief, each morning was greeted with pounding guilt for wishing that Ellie was any different than the miracle she was destined to be. Learn more about Down syndrome . We coped with the stress of her heart complication, from which she recovered by the time she was 3 months old, and we began to accept the challenges associated with Down syndrome that lay ahead. But the visual painted by the geneticist of Ellie as an adult, wearing a name tag and struggling to load a milk carton into a grocery bag, was etched in our minds. That description of Ellie's diminished outlook, delivered as a foregone conclusion, was difficult to accept. Her promise, stolen. It was an injustice that took time to fully appreciate and gnaws at me even today. Ellie, now almost 5, has tackled life head on, making friends and enjoying childhood while enduring endless hours of physical, occupational and speech therapies to track milestones that come naturally for her older brother. Ellie has braved \"two-a-days\" her entire life, showing up on time and ready to play. A dad's confession: I almost left my disabled daughter . Never have I been more proud than witnessing Ellie walk for the first time. Knees wobbly and body trembling, she reached to the outstretched arms there to support her while shooting a look that signaled, \"I've got this.\" In the nearly five years since Ellie's birth, we've experienced vast misunderstandings about the potential for individuals with Down syndrome. Too often, people look at Ellie and see \"disability.\" They see \"can't.\" Even highly educated clinicians are not immune to misconception, electing to chart her against diminished benchmarks of success and suggest that Ellie should settle for less because \"that's just the way most kids with 'Downs' are.\" A long list of possible accomplishments . And yet, we've met adults with Down syndrome who can check boxes for successful student, accomplished athlete, productive employee, prom king or queen or husband or wife. And while scientific breakthroughs and novel therapies should further advance the potential of Ellie's generation in the long-term, her daily accomplishments demand that we discount her disadvantages now. They demand that we focus on her abilities and expect more from her. The contradiction between Ellie's accomplishments and the geneticist's projection has shaped how we parent all three of our children (Ellie now also has a younger brother). We believe that children, whether they have Down syndrome or not, tend to perform to the level of expectations placed upon them. Expectations are often misconstrued as setting a floor on performance. Rather, we believe expectations serve as a ceiling, so we've learned the trick is to set high expectations balanced with reassurances that it is OK to fail. And the only true failure is not testing the boundaries of our capabilities, wherever that may be. From early on, we've educated Ellie's brothers about Down syndrome and what that means for her -- \"Ellie can do everything you can do; it just may take her longer or require extra help, but she'll get there eventually.\" Her older brother, then 3, retorted, \"Can she go to the moon?\" \"Yes,\" we responded. \"Maybe someday she can go to the moon.\" Of course, it's important to recognize challenges and provide resources to address them. It's true, Ellie needs support, and lots of it. But, too often, people focus on her disadvantages and lose sight of her strengths. Even school administrators try to classify her, listing her deficits, setting expectations low and building a case to separate her from her typically developing peers despite numerous studies that would suggest including her with her peers is mutually beneficial. But pigeonholing her is the path of least resistance. Low expectations are, after all, the easiest to meet. Behind that cute face is steely grit . The people closest to Ellie know the truth. They know that she is capable of much more than what most expect of her. That they shouldn't be fooled by her infectious smile, capable of lighting up a room, because behind that cute facade is a fiercely determined girl. Ellie proves that every Saturday during her rock climbing class. Sure, she is intimidated by the 30-foot walls, struggles with the climb and rarely makes it all the way to the top. But after a brief break, she'll look at me and say, \"Again, Daddy.\" And, equally importantly, the people closest to Ellie also know she is just like most of the 4-year-old girls in her preschool class. She is a princess at heart who loves to host play dates and go swimming. She enjoys playing catch with her brothers and occasionally catches flak for teasing them. She's more alike than different. Recently, we asked Ellie's older brother, \"Do you remember what it means for Ellie to have Down syndrome?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"It means she can go to the moon. But it's not fair, why does Ellie get the extra 'chrome?'\" He was referring to Ellie's extra copy of chromosome 21, the defining characteristic of Down syndrome. If only our society could look through that same lens and focus on abilities rather than disabilities. A prenatal screen pegged the odds of Ellie having Down syndrome at less than one in 3,000, so we like to think Ellie has defied expectations from the very beginning. And we trust she will continue to do so from here on out. Though we hope, one day, she won't have to. We hope one day our expectations of her, as a society, are more limitless than they are limited. Ellie has taught us many lessons about parental love, but perhaps the most important of which is not letting societal expectations dictate all that a child can be. As we enter the new year, we tend to make lots of resolutions -- most of which are forgotten long before February. I'm hoping Ellie's story can help us make a more lasting resolution, together, to recalibrate our societal expectations. Let's recognize the disadvantage, but not overcompensate for it by setting the bar too low. Let's, for this new year and all that follow after, see the \"can\" in those children affected by Down syndrome. In fact, let's do that for all our children -- extra chromosome or not. And, as for Ellie, she'll see you on the moon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bret Bowerman.\n\nSummary: Bret Bowerman's daughter, Ellie, is 4 and was born with Down syndrome. He feels that lowered expectations unnecessarily limit children with disabilities. \"Too often, people look at Ellie and see 'disability.' They see 'can't,' \" he writes.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Last week, President Obama's campaign launched a fictional storybook ad called, \"The Life of Julia.\" The slide show narrative follows Julia, a cartoon character, from age 3 to age 67 and explains how Obama's policies, from Head Start to Obamacare to mandated contraception coverage to Medicare reform, would provide Julia with a better life than Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan could. Julia is not your typical all-American girl, but an obviously independent, yuppie liberal woman. She goes to public school, graduates college, and becomes a Web designer. She is able to pursue her career because, at age 27, \"her health insurance is required to cover birth control and preventive care, letting Julia focus on her work rather than worry about her health.\" At age 31 she \"decides to have a child,\" with no mention of a father or husband. Her son Zachary heads off to a Race to the Top funded public school, while Julia goes on to start her own Web business. She retires at age 67 with Social Security and Medicare supporting her financially and spends her later years volunteering in a community garden. Julia's happily-ever-after tale is remarkably void of reality. Nowhere in her fictional life is it mentioned that Head Start has done little, if anything, to improve elementary education, that she will likely graduate with $25,000 in student loan debt, that she has a 50% chance of being unemployed or underemployed after college, that Medicare and Social Security are headed toward insolvency, and that her share of the national debt is $50,000 and growing. For Republicans, Julia's story might seem like a joke too good to be true, but they should take it very seriously. Because buried within \"The Life of Julia\" is the ideological vision of modern liberalism -- to create a state that takes care of its people from cradle to grave. The story of Julia is a microcosm of Obama's vision for America and emblematic of his view of the government's role in an individual's life. \"The Life of Julia\" has done what many conservatives have failed to do so far -- outline in exacting detail what modern Democratic policy wants for individuals. Here we have Obama's 21st century synthesis of the Great Society, New Deal and New Frontier. Julia's entire life is defined by her interactions with the state. Government is everywhere and each step of her life is tied to a government program. Notably absent in her story is any relationship with a husband, family, church or community, except a \"community\" garden where she works post-retirement. Instead, the state has taken their place and is her primary relationship. As banal and hackneyed as Julia's life of government dependence may seem, many Americans support it. After all, similar promises lured a number of European countries into overreaching and under-supported social safety nets. With the American family less intact than ever  and with single motherhood at historic highs, women like Julia are increasingly left on their own. The idea of government assistance can become more and more attractive to them and even necessary. Democratic policymakers realize that in the absence of self-sustaining family units, government can step in and fill the void. And a government large enough to fill that void can eventually take the place of the family altogether. Cultural commentator Heather Mac Donald recently wrote, \"The single mother has become the cornerstone of Democratic politics.\" Julia is the perfect example. In response, conservatives must defend their own cornerstones -- individual liberty, virtue and earned success. Conservatives must make the case that earned success is preferable to government dependency, and that Julia is more likely to achieve success and fulfillment in a good, stable family. As families grow stronger, schools, churches and communities improve, and Julia's chances for success improve, both for herself and her son. But as government grows larger and more intrusive, Julia's personal liberty and opportunities may shrink. Whatever pleasure Republicans may get from jokes or parodies of Julia, the fact is that many women will choose her life, some out of necessity or believing it's necessary. \"The Life of Julia\" should make it obvious that this election is about more than offering Julia a better job and more benefits. Conservatives must be able to provide Julia an alternative vision for a better future. Without it, Julia might have nowhere else to turn but to the government, and that is nothing to laugh about.

Manipulator: Paedophile John Thompson, 61, who was spared jail back in July despite admitting sexually assaulting a girl, 7,has now threatened to sue his victim . A paedophile is planning to sue his seven-year-old victim despite admitting sexually assaulting her and being sentenced for his attack earlier this year, a court heard. Manipulative John Thompson, 61, was spared jail in July after he insisted he was unable to fight off the young girl, claiming that she \u2018flirted\u2019 with him, pinned him to a bed and forced her tongue into his mouth. He was given an eight-month suspended sentence, provoking condemnation from child protection officials who called his claims \u2018outrageous\u2019 and said he should have been jailed. At his sentencing, Thompson, of Hartlepool, was also given a treatment order, supervision and a ban on contact with under-16s. Within a month of his court appearance, Thompson failed to turn up at a meeting with a probation worker and when he attended others he was said to be uncooperative and hostile. Nigel Soppitt, prosecuting, told Teesside Crown court on Friday that officials from the Probation Service consider the order to be unworkable because of Thompson\u2019s attitude. He has now said he is innocent, had received bad legal advice before he admitted the offence and is threatening to sue the schoolgirl for making the allegation against him. Judge Gillian Matthews, who passed the original sentence, told Thompson he was spared jail in the summer only because she wanted him to go on the treatment course. She said: \u201cYour approach to the Probation Service has been absolutely disgraceful...you have to engage with them. 'If you do not, you will go to prison. 'I am not having this attitude you have displayed at appointments. You have got one more chance - that\u2019s it. 'If you do not turn up with a better attitude, you will then go to prison.' Pervert: Teesside Crown Court (pictured) heard that Thompson has been hostile to probation services . Judge Matthews will have an update in a month, during which time Thompson, of Hartlepool, will have had another opportunity to take part in the programme. She said: \u201cHe is already complaining about his legal team, saying he should not have pleaded guilty and that he will sue the complainant - all classic traits of a paedophile.' Lorraine Mustard, for Thompson, said he client struggled to understand the terms of the suspended sentence order, but that he was now in no doubt what would happen if he failed again. She said: \u201cHe understands that the Probation Service have to confront him with some very difficult issues and the fact he feels uncomfortable about them is neither here nor there. 'There seems to be some misunderstanding which has been underlined to him today, and the onus is upon him to apply himself.'\n\nSummary: John Thompson, 61, claimed he could not fight off victim and that she \u2018flirted\u2019 with him but still admitted the sexual assault. Now he denies it and plans to sue the girl, Teesside Crown Court heard.",

When David Gower describes something as 'innovative' and 'inspirational'  you sit up and pay attention. The England legend says 'cricket has changed for the better' over the last 20 years. And he'd know - he has witnessed first-hand how the sport has evolved. From Hawk-Eye to Snicko, HotSpot to the batsman's wagonwheel - the presentation of cricket has been changing constantly during the former England captain's time at Sky Sports. VIDEO Scroll down to watch reaction to England's Test victory from Cook and Anderson . Looking on: Sky Sports pundits David Gower (right) and Ian Botham (left) look on during the Test . Behind the scenes: Cricket coverage on Sky Sports requires the use of more than 30 cameras and 80 staff . Pundits: Botham (centre) with Michael Atherton (right) and Nasser Hussian in the Sky Sports commentary box . As close as it gets: The players are often not happy with how invasive the cameramen can be at a match . Gadgets: Sky has introduced new innovations and technologies over the years, including the mobile Sky Pad . Victory: England beat India by 266 runs at the Ageas Bowl in the third Test to level the series at 1-1 . Joy: James Anderson (right) jumps after claiming a wicket during the match at the Ageas Bowl . At last: England captain Alastair Cook could celebrate his side's first win in 11 Test matches on Thursday . As England were marching headlong toward their first Test victory in 11 matches against India at the Ageas Bowl, an 80-strong team were buzzing around behind the scenes as Gower chatted on air. Crowds may have been disappointing for large parts of the third Test in Hampshire \u2013 with just 4,784 spectators in attendance on the fourth day \u2013 but the viewers at home were still tuning into the action on Sky Sports in their droves. Since Sky first broadcast cricket in 1990, when they covered England\u2019s overseas tour of the West Indies, innovations to enhance the viewer's experience have come thick and fast. Cricket fans do not just watch a bowler running in and a batsman slapping the ball through extra cover any more \u2013 they can listen to the on-field reaction thanks to stump microphones, see how a spinner has managed to get so many revolutions on the ball with hi-motion replays and find out if an opener has nicked the ball through Hot Spot analysis. The Sky Sports punditry team includes six former England captains, several Wisden cricketers of the year and World Cup winners. Between them they have: . The commentary team includes: . Central figure: Gower anchors Sky Sports' coverage of England's international cricket both home and away . On screen: England players form a huddle in the middle of the Ageas Bowl pitch while a cameraman films them . Test: Sky Sports pundit Michael Atherton (left) talks with Alastair Cook (centre) as MS Dhoni (right) looks on . Innovations: Michael Holding (left) and Ian Ward talk through issues on Sky Sports Zone during the third Test . Sky Sports cover a range of different cricket matches including international Tests, ODIs and Twenty20s, as well as county matches. For just one cricket match, here is what is needed: . The public face of the operation are the star-studded pundits who boast 769 Tests, 33,440 runs and 1,694 wickets between them \u2013 including Sportsmail columnists Nasser Hussain and David 'Bumble' Lloyd alongside Gower, Andrew Strauss, Shane Warne, Michael Holding and Sir Ian Botham \u2013 as well as the stats man Benedict Bermange. The pundits and production staff are well . fed - they get an extensive menu at every ground, with the Ageas Bowl . providing options including prawn jalfrezi, with curry a favourite of . Botham and the rest, as well as salmon or lasagne. Each match alone needs more than 30 cameras, 40 microphones, 15 production trucks and 15 miles of cabling are placed around the ground and controlled by a crew of 80 staff. But there is one view cricket fans rarely glimpse - the sheer manpower that goes into providing the pictures. Gower \u2013 a veteran of 117 Tests, including 32 as England captain \u2013 said of the operation: \u2018It is huge what goes on behind the scenes. 'Because of the innovations and the developments provided by the production staff we can be very forensic about pretty much anything. If you have someone like a Shane Warne up against you, if you think \"how do I steal a bit of a clue about facing them?\" You can view his action on screen in depth. That would have been \u2013 and now should be \u2013 an advantage. Close-up: Sky use 30 cameras in order to provide as many angles and slow-motion replays as possible . Pricey: For cricket coverage Sky Sports use this state-of-the-art truck... the most expensive in Europe . Wires: Hundreds of cables are attached to Sky's new broadcast truck used during the third Test . View: The truck is home to 78 different TV screens which each show a different feed of the match . On show: The director chooses from the different feeds what will be shown next on Sky's coverage . 'DRS (the Decision Review System) has helped to change the game on the field as well as for the viewers back home \u2013 we just have this strange situation where the Indians can opt out of it, but we can still use it in the studio and it has definitely moved the game forward.' Holding, the former West Indian fast bowler who was nicknamed the 'Whispering Death', was equally as effusive of Sky's development of cricket. In his famous Caribbean twang, Holding explained: 'Having all the information we get now cannot do the players any harm \u2013 if they don\u2019t want to use it then ignore it. 'The most important thing for me as a former bowler is the Wagon Wheel which shows where a batsman scores his runs. That would have really helped me to decide where to bowl to them to starve them of runs and it is a great innovation.' Decisions on which pictures from the 30 camera feeds and the various gadgets used will be broadcast to the viewer next are decided from inside an \u00a38m truck \u2013 the most expensive on the road in Europe \u2013 using 78 screens. In some ways the lavish expenditure on the production of cricket appears vulgar, but viewers want innovations, and in a world where budgets keep increasing and the likes of BT Sport are competing for every sport going, it makes sense to try and eek out every little bit to highlight how the coverage is different. Sky Sports has broadcast cricket since 1990 \u2013 when they showed live coverage of England\u2019s tour of the West Indies. It has developed its production over time and the director\u2019s truck which is the most expensive truck on the roads in Europe. Here are some of the main innovations since cricket started on Sky: . 1990 \u2013 Stump microphones . 1991 \u2013 Stump cameras . 1999 \u2013 Widescreen . 2000 \u2013 Interactivity (red button options) 2003 \u2013 Helmet-cams and player mics . 2004 \u2013 Umpire mics . 2004 \u2013 Ultra-motion replays . 2006 \u2013 Hi-motion replays . 2006 \u2013 High definition . 2007 \u2013 Hot Spot analysis . 2008 \u2013 Field Plan . 2009 \u2013 Pitchcam . 2010 \u2013 3D international cricket . 2011 \u2013 3D country cricket . 2013 \u2013 SkyCart . Sky Pad: Holding (left) and Ward (right) talk through issues on Sky Sports Zone in front of the cameras . Angles: Members of the 80-strong production staff trawl through footage to provide replays and analysis . Former captain Andrew Strauss is the newest member of the punditry team - having made the switch from the playing field to the commentary box. He said: 'I played with some of the guys before I came here but walking in on the first morning and being like: \"Hi guys, you are the people who have been criticising me for the last six years, nice to work with you\", was a bit strange. 'Everyone feels a little bit sheepish but it is very much a team environment in the commentary box. 'Every cricket team now has an analyst so they will be putting together packages from all of the new technology - it really has taken the game forward unbelievably over the years.' Talkative: Sportsmail and Sky Sports pundit Nasser Hussain during commentary of the Test match . In the middle: Michael Atherton (second right) interviews England captain Alastair Cook (right) after the toss . Long history: Sky have been covering live international cricket, both home and away, since 1990 . Analysis: Number crunching is done behind the scenes to provide the commentators with facts and figures . As Strauss explains: \u2018We (the pundits) just do the easy work by chatting away \u2013 it\u2019s those guys behind the scenes who provide you with all your lovely pictures and graphics.\u2019 Cricket coverage has been revolutionised in the last 24 years and innovations will continue and the viewer\u2019s experience will improve further. Who knows what the next new gadget on show will be. As Gower says: 'Cricket has really been dragged into the 21st Century by Sky \u2013 who knows where they will take it next.' And who knows, maybe one day the Indians may even accept that technology - and in particular DRS - is here to stay. Discussion: England captain Alastair Cook (left) talks with Sky pundit Ian Ward (right) in front of the Sky Pad . All angles covered: Analysis is provided pre-match, post-match, during the match and also online . State of the art: The 80-strong production staff use top-end equipment to provide angles and slow-mos . Sky Sports\u2019 international cricket is part of an unrivalled summer of sport including F1, US PGA golf, US Open tennis & Barclays Premier League.\n\nSummary: Sky Sports introduced their first cricket broadcast in 1990 with a state-of-the-art truck worth \u00a310 million, featuring 100 TV screens for the production team. The coverage includes innovative technology like Ball-Tracking, UltraEdge, and Thermal Imaging. David Gower leads the commentary team for international cricket in England, with experts like Sir Ian Botham and Shane Warne. The commentators enjoy a gourmet menu, with beef wellington as their preferred dish. England secured a victory against Australia by 300 runs, taking a 2-1 lead in the Ashes series at the Ageas Bowl.",

GoDaddy has revealed that one of their two costly ads will feature a woman, whose identity will remain a mystery until Sunday night, who will announce her departure from her current job in the TV spot. The company released a teaser video about the ad this morning with actor John Turtutto walking into a home as he tells how someone is preparing to pursue her dream. Ushering in the quitter: Actor John Turtutto is featured in the teaser that announces how a woman will quit her job in real time as part of a GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial . No clues except the gender of the individual have been released, with her name being bleeped out in the teaser video. 'She's a real person with a real dream of starting her very own business,' Turtutto says. 'She's got a message for her boss in front of a hundred million people.' GoDaddy confirmed the validity of the stunt, issuing a statement saying: \u2018Her boss doesn't know! He or she is going to find out while watching the commercial with the rest of the viewers\u2014after the commercial, a formal resignation letter will be delivered and she'll give her two-week notice.\u2019 The company is inevitably trying to make their commercial the latest in a string of very public quitting videos. Mystery: No clues have been revealed about the woman's identity . The most well-known in the genre came from Marina Schifrin, a video editor who filmed a synchronized dance routine to a Kanye West song that listed out her reasons for wanting to leave her job. In case the woman's 'I quit' moment, which the company has called 'gutsy', doesn't become viral, they have a second commercial planned out as well. The second ad, which has been released in full online already, goes along the website domain hosting company's more traditional advertising route. Other route: The company's second Super Bowl ad features shirtless body builders and spokeswoman Danica Patrick . It features a stampede of bare-chested body builders- and company spokeswoman Danica Patrick- racing to a tanning salon after the fictional shop's owner listed it using one of their websites. Advertising experts see the two commercials not as a stunt but as an indication that GoDaddy is attempting to change their public image in a way to support women. 'GoDaddy is evolving its messaging away from sleaze and toward a more respectable focus on women as business owners,' AdWeek speculated. By contrast, their 2013 Super Bowl ad featured model Bar Rafaeli making out with 'geek' Jesse Heiman.\n\nSummary: Domain hosting company have teased one of their Super Bowl commercials by saying a woman will quit on air. Company confirmed that the woman, who has not been named, will send in a resignation letter after the ad airs on Sunday. The stunt is one of two ads GoDaddy will air during the Super Bowl. A 30-second ad at this year's game is expected to cost $4million.",

A mother raising her four children in a ninth-floor council flat has won a move after successfully arguing they could fall to their deaths. Fartuuna Warsame waged a three-year battle with Birmingham City Council, which has now agreed to move her family on safety grounds. The local authority hope that, by giving way before a court appeal was heard, it would avoid setting a legal precedent which would open the floodgates for demands for moves from high-rise flats. New home: Mother Fartuuna Warsame won a battle against Birmingham City Council to get moved from a tower block as it was dangerous to live there . Mrs Warsame has lived in the flat in Thames Tower, Nechells, Birmingham, for seven years. She said: 'This is such a relief. The ninth floor is no place to bring up young children. 'They can easily get the windows open. I dare not even go into another room. I told the council it would be responsible if a child fell.' The single mother claimed she was stopped from fitting her own window locks in case of fire. Her children are Aisha, eight, Rukaya, five, Aaliyah, two, and her baby Ridwan. Last month a girl of two fell to her death from a third-floor flat in a Bristol tower block. Danger: Mrs Warsame argued that it was unsafe to live with four children in a ninth-floor flat in this Birmingham block . Mrs Warsame's solicitor Mike Milvaney, of Community Law Partnership, said at times she had to leave her children alone in the flat as she struggled up the stairs with her baby and shopping. He said: 'Councils must think carefully about continuing to leave or place young families with children in tower blocks. 'It is no answer to say that budget constraints and limited resources are to blame when young lives are at risk. 'The council has a moral and legal duty to consider the reasonableness of the accommodation provided.' Battle: Mrs Warsame said: 'I dare not even go into another room. I told the council it would be responsible if a child fell' A council spokesman said the decision was not binding on others. He added: 'Due to the large number of flats in the city, a number of families live in similar properties, in line with the council's housing allocations policy. 'Though the family were given the right to be moved in this case, no admissions were made as to the merits of the appeal and the appeal was dismissed.'\n\nSummary: Fartuuna Warsame was forced to move after her child fell from a ninth-floor balcony in Birmingham, winning a legal battle against the city council.",

Joy Bricker first stayed in Room 202 at Towne Place Suites by Marriott, in Falls Church, Virginia, on August 4, 2001 and only moved out last week. The former pilot from Pennsylvania lost her husband, Glenn, to cancer 10 years ago and soon afterwards was offered a job at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and jumped at the opportunity. Mrs Bricker, who spent most of her married life in Ashland, New Hampshire, negotiated a deal which meant that she was paying $139 (\u00a387) a night for the 500 sq ft, two-bedroom suite.

Mrs Bricker began her professional career late in life - when she was 50. Years of political organising helped her strike up a friendship with Elizabeth and Bob Dole which led to her first job during Ronald Regan's administration at the Department of Transportation in 1981. An appointment at the White House followed, where she began work for the campaign 'A Drug Free America' in 1986. After moving in to Room 202 Mrs Bricker quickly became a part of the hotel community, and has outstayed six managers, and has developed firm opinions about how the hotel should be run. But the only piece of furniture she introduced to the room was an old armchair. In addition, there were only some plants, computer equipment, books and photo albums to move out of the room. She made friends with staff and neighbours, and recently her Kuwaiti friend who lived next door to Room 202 brought round traditional meals of spiced stew for them to share. 'It's helped my appetite,' she told CNN. 'I call it community planning. I turned it into a community. 'I would give a million dollars to manage a property like this for one year. 'No matter where we look, there\u2019s always ways to save a few more pennies.' Her daughter, Christy Winton, added of her mother: 'She turned them into family, and they accepted.' Now suffering from osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, Mrs Bricker will move in with her daughter in New York and she intends to use her energies in the church. She said: 'If I've set a goal, I'm going to reach it.' And she said that her goal now is to 'continue offering whatever I am able to give' and added: 'I have to help. I'm not a sitter.' But Mrs Winton warned her mother with a smile: 'There\u2019s no continental breakfast at the Winton Inn.'\n\nSummary: Former White House staffer sets record for longest stay at Marriott, outlasting six presidents during her tenure.",

The play-off to is to progress to the main draw of Europe's premier club competition, but the Gunners will look to avoid complacency as they go toe-to-toe with the Turkish side in a bid to reach the group stages . But what can Arsene Wenger's side expect to face in the play-off? Here Sportsmail gives you a guide to Besiktas, the team which stands in Arsenal's way of reaching Europe's elite . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Demba Ba completes his move to Besiktas from Chelsea . Familiar face: Demba Ba is likely to feature for Besiktas when they face Arsenal in the Champions League . BESIKTAS . UEFA ranking:\u00a066 . Record against Arsenal: Never played . How they qualified:\u00a0Third in Turkish Super League . Besiktas finished just three points behind Galatasary last term but a mammoth 12 behind champions Fenerbahce. That's the same Fenerbahce who were beaten 5-0 on aggregate by the Gunners in a Champions League play-off last year. Easy street: Arsenal defeated Fenerbahce 5-0 on aggregate in a Champions League play-off last season . But with the Turkish champions banned from Europe, Besiktas inherited the second of the two Champions League places on offer to Turkey. They have only won the Turkish top flight three times in the last 20 years, with their last success coming in 2009. Besiktas are consistent finishers inside the top four, having only finished below the position just twice since 1980. Star man - Demba Ba . There's plenty for Arsenal to be concerned about in Besiktas - especially their attacking prowess. The Turkish side feature Demba Ba in attack, with the former Chelsea and Newcastle striker an \u00a38million signing from the Blues earlier this summer. Hat-trick hero: Demba Ba (centre) scored a treble for Besiktas on his home debut against Feyenoord . Already he has found the score sheet, netting a hat-trick on his home debut in the third qualifying round 3-1 win over Feyenoord. Manager - Slaven Bilic . As Croatia boss, Bilic was once touted as one of the Europe's most promising managers. The former West Ham and Everton defender famously recorded two wins over England in the Euro 2008 qualifiers to help dump the Three Lions out of the tournament before Steve McClaren's side had even left Wembley for Austria and Switzerland. On the up: Slaven Bilic is rebuilding his reputation at Besiktas after a disastrous spell at Lokomotiv Moscow . After leaving Croatia, Bilic's reputation took a battering after just one season at Lokomotiv Moscow as he guided the Russian club to their worst league placing since 1992, with a ninth placed finish. The former defender has since re-emerged at Besiktas where in his first season at the club he guided them back into Champions League contention. Out the hat: UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino draws Besiktas in Nyon to face Arsenal in the play-offs . Group stage campaigns:\u00a0Five (last appearance - 2009-10) In the Champions League era, Besiktas have only made the main tournament five times - never progressing beyond the group stage. Last season:\u00a0Europa League play-offs . Having been out of Champions League action since 2009, the last three seasons have seen Besiktas compete in the Europa League. Defeat in England: Besiktas reached the Europa League last 16 in 2012 but were beaten by Stoke along the way . They reached the last 32 in 2011 before going one better in a year later to reach the last 16. But they were kicked out of the competition following their play-off victory over Tromso last term following previous match fixing allegations. Best European Cup performance:\u00a0Quarter-finals (1986-87) Besiktas' finest European Cup campaign came in 1987...where they won just two games before reaching the quarter-finals. Two victories to defeat Dinamo Tirana, were followed by a walkover victory over APOEL who were prohibited by their Cypriot government from playing the tie. The joy for Besiktas was short lived however, as Dynamo Kiev thrashed them 7-0 on aggregate in the last eight. Playing the Blues: John Terry (front) looks stunned as Besiktas's biggest Champions League away victory came at Chelsea with a 2-0 win in 2003 . UEFA records: . Biggest home win . 3-0 vs Barcelona (19/09/00, group stage) Biggest away win . 2-0 vs Chelsea (01/10/2003, group stage) Heavy hiding: But Peter Crouch was on target as Liverpool beat them 8-0 at Anfield in 2007 to inflict their heaviest European defeat . Humiliated: Besiktas were hugely embarrassed after being beaten 8-0 by Liverpool in the Champions League . Heaviest home defeat . 0-3 vs VfL Wolfsburg (03/11/09, group stage) Heaviest away defeat . 0-8 vs Liverpool (06/11/07, group stage)\n\nSummary: Arsenal prepares to challenge Fenerbahce in the Champions League play-offs, with Demba Ba leading the attack for the Gunners and Slaven Bilic managing the Turkish team. Last season, Arsenal overcame Besiktas with a 5-0 aggregate victory in the same competition.",

A notorious British paedophile is expected to spend the rest of his life in a mosquito-plagued Far East prison after being convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl five years ago. Former hairdresser David Fletcher, 67, has been sent to prison in Cambodia's insufferable Prey Sar prison to serve out a 10-year sentence after he was arrested when he was extradited from neighbouring Thailand earlier this week. He had been convicted of rape in his absence by a court in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, after he fled to Thailand in the wake of claims that he was using a charity to groom for sex a number of poverty-stricken children who lived in a rubbish dump. Visitors at the entrance to Cambodia's notorious Prey Sar Prison where Fletcher will serve a 10-year prison sentence . Following Cambodia's request to have him extradited from Thailand, Fletcher went to the Thai Court of Appeal to fight the move - but the court upheld the Cambodian demand. According to The Cambodia Daily, Fletcher is the first paedophile ever to be sent back to Cambodia to serve a prison sentence. Cambodia was once the haunt of notorious child molester Gary Glitter . Last night, Mr Samleang Seila, director of the anti-paedophile group Action Pour les Enfants, spoke of his gratitude to the authorities for pressing on with their attempts to have Fletcher extradited. 'We are satisfied with this extradition,' Mr Seila told the Daily. 'Even if it took so much time, we are happy it was done.' Fletcher, from Cambridge, has a history of assaults on children. On one occasion in 1967, he was sentenced by the Norwich Crown Court to 18 months in jail for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, who he was said to have plied with champagne. He said of his conviction later: 'She was just my girlfriend\u2026I just did it ahead of her 16th birthday. People will stoop very low to say bad things about me.' Later in Cambodia police built up a file of evidence showing that Fletcher had used his charity to groom young girls - and also their families - with the intention of having sex with the them. Cambodia was once the haunt of notorious child molester Gary Glitter, who fled to neighbouring Vietnam when authorities moved in on him. He was later arrested for sexual molestation of children in Thailand and after serving a prison sentence was deported back to the UK.\n\nSummary: David Fletcher, a British philanthropist, has been honored in Cambodia for his charitable work with impoverished children and will spend his retirement volunteering at Prey Sar prison.",

The statement could signal the Taliban's public willingness to talk to the United States for the first time. Calling himself \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan spokesman,\" Zabiullah Mujaheed said the Taliban have a \"preliminary agreement with Qatar and other respective sides.\" The Taliban are asking for the release of prisoners from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for opening the office, he said. He said the group is also \"ready for talks and negotiation inside the country.\" It appears to be the first time the Taliban -- who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion -- have offered talks without the condition of an American withdrawal from the country. Read more about Qatar as a mediator . It is not clear if the purported spokesman speaks for all parts of the loose-knit Afghan Taliban. His statement was released in Pashto, a local language. \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to solve any problem with its opposite side through talks,\" the statement said. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul responded cautiously to the statement. \"We support an Afghan-led reconciliation process in which the Taliban breaks with al Qaeda, renounces violence and accepts the Afghan constitution, especially protections for minorities and women,\" said Gavin Sundwall, a U.S. Embassy spokesman. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States is prepared to support an Afghan-led reconciliation. \"But this process will only be successful if the Taliban are prepared to renounce violence, break ties with al Qaeda, support the Afghan constitution in all of its elements, including human rights for all citizens, and particularly for women,\" she said. Nuland said U.S. officials are not aware of any formal announcement, \"but we are prepared to support a process that the Afghans support. \" A top Afghan peace official said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the Taliban statement. \"We are optimistic that they want to come to the negotiating table, but we have to be cautious because words alone are not enough,\" said Ismail Qassemyar, a member of the country's High Peace Council. He agreed with the Americans that talks had to take place between Afghans. The peace talks are \"an Afghan process .... Americans can't give them anything in Afghanistan because America can't make any decision on behalf of the Afghan nation,\" he said. Last week he warned against the United States or other nations trying to strike their own peace deals with the militants. \"We ask our international friends not to hold any kind of talks with the Taliban leaders,\" Qassemyar said December 27. Recent media reports have said the United States and other foreign governments with a stake in the Afghan war may try to strike a separate deal with the Taliban. The Washington Post reported in December that the Obama administration reached a tentative deal with Taliban negotiators that would have included the Taliban's public renunciation of international terrorism and the transfer of five Afghans from Guantanamo Bay. The deal collapsed, the Post said, because of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's objections. Any talk of a peace process slowed in September when suicide bombers killed senior Afghan peace negotiator and former President Burhannudin Rabbani. Karzai told CNN in December that the government cannot hold talks until the Islamic militia identifies a representative with the authority to negotiate. Karzai said Rabbani's death showed that \"we were actually talking to nobody.\" \"A man who came in the name of a messenger for peace turned out to be a suicide bomber,\" Karzai said. \"Therefore, we have now clearly said that we will welcome a Taliban address, but that address must have the clarity that this representative is authorized and is representing the Taliban movement as we see it.\" Qassemyar said a Taliban office in Qatar would by no means legitimize the Islamist group. \"We accept an address for the Taliban in Qatar if they come there as a movement or a group, not a government or use it as a propaganda venue,\" he said.\n\nSummary: NEW: Nuland: \"We are prepared to support a process that the Afghans support\" The Taliban have a preliminary deal to open an office in Qatar, a statement says. They want detainees freed from Guantanamo Bay as a condition for talks. It appears to be their first public offer of talks without a U.S. withdrawal.",

Chris McManus was executed by gunmen as members of the Special Boat Service and Nigerian soldiers moved in on the Al Qaeda-inspired terrorists\u2019 hideaway. Fellow hostage, Italian Franco Lamolinara, was also killed. The pair had been held for ten months. WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW . Captured: Chris McManus, left, and Franco Lamolinara, right, in the first video released by their kidnappers in Nigeria in August last year . British hostage: Christopher McManus was killed by his captors yesterday as . troops moved in to rescue him amid fears his life was in 'imminent and . growing danger' Fears for Mr McManus\u2019s welfare had intensified following the release of a video in August showing the 28-year-old engineer blindfolded alongside three armed men. One of the terrorists said it would be the \u2018last message\u2019 to David Cameron about the hostage. Yesterday the Prime Minister broke the news of the execution to Mr McManus\u2019s family in a personal phone call before making a public statement in which he appeared emotional. It is the second time he has ordered a hostage rescue mission that has failed. Scottish aid worker Linda Norgrove died when Special Forces tried to rescue her from the Taliban in Afghanistan. Mr Cameron had also telephoned his Italian counterpart Mario Monti to tell him of the failed operation \u2013 but last night there was growing anger in Italy as it became clear that Rome was informed of the raid to free the hostages only once it had got underway. Video plea: Mr McManus is seen pleading for his life as his armed captors stand behind him in the second video to be released by his kidnappers in December . Blindfolded: Mr McManus has a thick black blindfold placed over his eyes throughout the duration of the video . Further details of the rescue bid were emerging last night, but it remained unknown whether Mr McManus and Mr Lamolinara \u2013 a 48-year-old father of two \u2013 died before or during the operation. There were reports the men may have been held in a house in Sokoto, a city in Nigeria\u2019s north-west. One witness said: \u2018The security agencies tried to break into the house but there was resistance. The people inside the house were shooting at them and they returned fire.\u2019 None of the 20 strong British rescue force was injured and Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said all the terrorists had been arrested. The rescue was triggered when \u2013 after months of searching \u2013 the SBS found the heavily protected location where the men were being held. Mr Cameron said authorities had decided to go ahead with the rescue after receiving \u2018credible information about [the men\u2019s] location\u2019. \u2018A window of opportunity arose to secure their release. We also had reason to believe that their lives were under imminent and growing danger,\u2019 he insisted. The Prime Minister said it was \u2018with great regret\u2019 that he had to announce Mr McManus, from Oldham, and Mr Lamolinara had lost their lives in the subsequent operation. \u2018I am very sorry that this ended so tragically,\u2019 he stressed, adding: \u2018Terrorism and appalling crimes such as these are a scourge on our world. No one should be in any doubt about our determination to fight and to defeat them.\u2019 Mr McManus, a contract worker for an Italian construction company, was kidnapped by gunmen in May last year after they stormed his apartment in Birnin-Kebbi in the north-west of Nigeria. Mr Lamolinara, a 48-year-old father of two of Gattinara near Turin, was also taken. A German colleague escaped by scaling a wall despite being shot and injured. Last night Mr McManus\u2019s parents, two brothers and sister issued a statement thanking all involved in the attempted rescue. It said: \u2018We are of course devastated by the news of Chris\u2019s death, which we received earlier today. Members of the Special Boat Service, pictured here on a training exercise, were sent in to the kidnappers' hideout to try and rescue the two hostages . \u2018During this ordeal we have relied heavily on the support of our family and friends which has never waned and has enabled us to get through the most difficult of times. \u2018We are also aware of the many people who were working to try and have Chris returned to our family, and his girlfriend. We would like to thank all of them for their efforts.\u2019 The family said they were confident \u2018everything that could be done was being done\u2019 during their ten-month ordeal and sent their condolences to relatives of the other dead hostage.\u2019 The kidnapped men had been working on building a bank in the city, the capital of the lawless Kebbi province. In August a Nigerian group calling itself \u2018Al Qaeda in the land beyond the Sahel\u2019 claimed responsibility for the kidnap and released the video showing Mr McManus, in a Manchester United shirt, with three men armed with Kalashnikov rifles and a machete. He pleaded for the British Government to answer the demands of the group to save his life. One of the kidnappers then said the British Government had failed to answer its demands and it was given two weeks to \u2018take the correct decision\u2019. Yesterday, security officials said they believed the kidnappers were from a splinter group of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has links to Al Qaeda. Sources said Ministry of Defence officials approached Mr Cameron on Wednesday evening and made it clear they believed there was a \u2018time-limited opportunity\u2019 to mount an attempt to free the men. The Prime Minister took the decision to go ahead and then followed the operation \u2018in real time\u2019 yesterday morning. A meeting of the Government\u2019s emergency committee Cobra was convened, but word came back that the two men had been killed by their captors. The Italian prime minister\u2019s office said that it had been \u2018constantly in touch with British authorities but that the operation had got underway with the Nigerians and British forces with Italy informed once it had begun\u2019. Former Italian prime minister Massimo D\u2019Alema said: \u2018I want full light to be shed on why Italy was only informed once the operation had started.\u2019 WATCH THE VIDEO .\n\nSummary: British Chris McManus and Italian Franco Lamolinara were captured by kidnappers in May while working in northern Nigeria.\nTwo videos showing the hostages pleading for their lives while under armed guard were released by their captors.\nPM David Cameron authorised the rescue mission as the pair's lives were in 'imminent and growing danger'\nBut the kidnappers killed the two men as members of the Special Boat Service and Royal Marine commandos moved in on their hideout.",

Stiviano just moments before she defended him in an interview with Barbara Walters on Friday.

Get off this elevator and shut the f*** up!' a guest who rode in a hotel elevator with the couple told the New York Daily News. Yelled at: Donald Sterling reportedly got into a public fight with girlfriend V. Stiviano just minutes before she sat down for an interview with Barbara Walters on Friday . Upset: Another guest at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel got into an elevator with the couple when Sterling started yelling at his girlfriend, calling her a 'media w****'. Pictured above at a Clippers game in October 2010 . Stiviano then pressed a random button and got off at the 15th floor. Sterling continued to yell at a man who appeared to be his lawyer, complaining about Stiviano. 'He was yelling, \"She's f****** crazy! I can't deal with her! She's nuts\"' the source reported. The witness says Sterling rode the elevator down to the lobby and then stormed out of the hotel.Twenty minutes later, Stiviano sat down for an interview with Walters, in which she said she loved Sterling and that he is a 'very generous and kind man'. The interview was the first time 31-year-old Stiviano has spoken publicly about the scandal surrounding her and Sterling. The 81-year-old Clippers owner was banned from the NBA last week after audio recordings surfaced of him making racist comments to Stiviano. In the recordings, Sterling tells Stiviano not to bring black people to his games or pose with them in photos on Instagram. Despite being chewed out by Sterling just minutes before, Stiviano spoke fondly of him saying she doesn't believe he's a racist. 'I think the things he says are not the things he feels,' she said. 'Anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment.' On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver . banned Sterling for life, fined him $2.5million and urged league owners . to force him to sell the team. A three-quarters vote by the NBA owners . is required to force him to sell. Decisive action: Last week, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league and called for the Board of Governors to force Sterling to sell his team. Pictured at the press conference on April 29 . Sterling's estranged wife Shelly is also in favor of the decision to force her husband out, saying she 'fully supported' Silver's action. 'As a next step, both the league and the team should work together to find some fresh, accomploished exectuive leadership for the Clippers,' she said in a statement Saturday. 'As a co-owner, I am fully committed to taking the necessary steps to make the Clippers the best team in the NBA. That has been my aspiration ever since 1981.' Mrs Sterling is still married to her husband but the two have been seperated him for several years. She was present as the Clippers defeated the Golden State Warriors in a playoff game on Saturday.

The Clippers beat the Warriors 126-121 at Saturday's game . Mrs Sterling greets a Clippers fan at Saturday's playoff game . Stiviano told Walters that she 'absolutely' thinks Sterling should apologize for his comments, but that 'only God knows' if he will. She also said she believes Sterling's outrageous comments were, in part, a generational issue. 'I think Mr Sterling's from a different generation than I am. I think he was brought up to believe these things,' she said, before accidentally tipping Walters off that despite being a Jew, Sterling has anti-Semitic views also. 'But through his actions, he's shown that he's not a racist. Through his actions, he's shown himself to be a very generous and kind man,' she said. The racist diatribe which Sterling can be heard making on audio recorded by Stiviano herself, was prompted by people saying bad things about Sterling's relationship with Stiviano. Confidante: Stiviano told Walters that she had been with Donald Sterling before the interview and that he is 'emotionally traumatized' Saving face: Stiviano is seen emerging from her home before the interview wearing her now-customary face visor . All white: V. Stiviano stepped out in a crisp white suit hours after leaving the house in head-to-toe black . In abstract and sometimes rambling . terms, Stiviano appeared to paint herself as Sterling's savior during . his time of need - despite the fact that it is alleged she released the . recordings responsible for his downfall herself. 'I . think Mr Sterling is being tested right now, by a higher power or . being. And I'm forced to come to his rescue because he can't rescue . himself.' When pressed to . explain the relationship between herself and Sterling, Stiviano said, . 'I'm Mr Sterling's personal assistant. Like I said, I'm his right hand. I'm his wingman. What isn't there to understand?' Walters asked whether Stiviano, then, is Sterling's employee. 'He . first started paying me as an employee and then he started paying me . off the books,' she responded, no doubt referring to the million-dollar . home, four luxury cars and $240,000 'living expenses' she has reportedly . received. 'I became part of . Mr Sterling's team. I became someone who protected him, someone who . took care of him, someone who watched everything he said and did, and . people did not like that.' 'So you helped him become a better person?' asked Walters. 'In every way. In every way,' responded Stiviano. 'Silly rabbit': V. Stiviano described herself to Barbara Walters as Donald Sterling's 'everything' She wouldn't allow Sterling to take meetings with certain people, Stiviano told Walters, which angered his business peers. Social butterfly: Stiviano has been seen around town in the wake of the controversy, but Sterling, her 'father figure' has been no where to be seen . She . said that executives and board members of the Clippers who were jealous . of the free reign she had when it came to the team would call Sterling . and tell him that Stiviano had brought people 'who look a certain way' to Clippers games when she wasn't there. But . not just black people, Stiviano claimed, but people 'that didn't give . me a good look,' like 'gangsters,' 'thugs,' 'bad women.' Walters asked, 'Are you in love with Donald Sterling?' 'I love him,' Stiviano responded, smiling widely, adding that she's not in love but rather loves him 'like a father figure.' Denying she's Sterling's 'mistress' or 'whore,' she said that she's more like his friend and right hand. 'I\u2019m Mr. Sterling\u2019s everything. I\u2019m his confidante, his best friend, his silly rabbit,' she said, bizarrely. Stiviano . said the pair met while she was working for Sterling's non-profit . organization, the Donald T Sterling Foundation and evolved 'to so much . more.' After the lengthy talk with Walters, Stiviano put her now-customary visor back over her face to face the waiting paparazzi. She told Walters it is a protective measure. 'I'm hurting, I'm in pain. It hurts to see someone you\u00a0 care about hurting. It hurts to see people speculate, assume, say, throw darts at you when they don't know you ... It's easier to mask the pain.' Sterling was initially supposed to give . an interview to both Walters and CNN's Anderson Cooper, but dropped out . at the last minute. Walters got to continue with a solo interview of . Stiviano while Cooper came out empty-handed.\n\nSummary: Donald Sterling, the 81-year-old Lakers owner, was overheard berating V. Stiviano in a hotel elevator shortly before she praised him in a televised interview. Witnesses claim Sterling insulted Stiviano, calling her a 'media sensation' and 'unstable.' Despite the altercation, Sterling joined Stiviano for the interview with Walters, which proceeded without incident. Sterling faces no repercussions from the NBA, which has remained silent on his recent racist remarks.

Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to seek a capital case, which would introduce a possible death penalty in a conviction. \"The decision on whether or not to pursue the death penalty in this case is multi-layered and begins with the trial lawyers in Los Angeles and ends with the U.S. attorney general,\" Mrozek said. A grand jury on December 17 indicted Ciancia on a charge of murdering a federal officer, two counts of attempted murder of a federal officer and eight firearms-related charges. According to the criminal complaint against Ciancia, he allegedly entered Terminal 3 at the Los Angeles airport, pulled out a .223-caliber M&P-15 semiautomatic rifle and fired several shots point-blank at Hernandez. He began to walk up an escalator, but saw Hernandez move and returned to shoot him again, authorities allege in the complaint. Investigators say Ciancia then fired on two other TSA officers and a passenger, all of whom were wounded, before a Los Angeles police officer chased him down and shot him, according to the complaint. Investigators found a handwritten letter among Ciancia's belongings at the airport addressed to TSA employees, saying the shootings were meant to \"instill fear in your traitorous minds.\" The note said he had made a \"conscious decision to try to kill\" TSA workers, according to the complaint. Alerted to troubling text messages sent to his family back East, Los Angeles police officers had gone to check on Ciancia the morning of the shooting but didn't arrive in time. They got to his apartment 52 minutes after the shooting and left without realizing his connection to the incident, according to authorities. Obama visits family of slain TSA officer .

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- For most people, keeping fit involves an established exercise routine built around a regular weekly schedule. But what if your job involves large amounts of travel? Many people come back from trips away carrying extra pounds from disruption to regular exercise, as well as an increased tendency to overindulge on business dinners paid for on the company card. According to the World Health Organisation, lack of exercise not only impairs your waistline, but can also reduce energy and concentration levels -- the exact qualities that are required when conducting business abroad. Shani Anderson is a personal trainer and managing director of Anderson Fitness Consultants. The British former Olympian says that with the right foresight, it's possible to incorporate a healthy regime wherever and however you travel. 1) Don't treat business travel as a \"holiday\" from your health regime . There's a temptation to regard exercise as a means to looking good on holiday, rather than as an ongoing strategy for health and well-being. \"A lot of people diet or work out to go on holiday. And for me that's a problem, because you have short-term goals,\" says Anderson. \"You switch off when you reach the goal, and your body goes 'great, I'm done' - and in two weeks you're back the way you were before.\" According to Anderson, this exemplifies the most common obstacle to keeping fit while traveling: Attitude. People tend to perceive trips away from home as in some way separate from the rest of their lives and that therefore the same rules no longer apply. 2) Prepare and do research . Before you travel, investigate the best locations for your preferred form of exercise. If you're into cycling, see if there's a local bike hire company nearby; if you're a jogger, plan the most scenic route to get the most of your new environment. Anderson's motto is \"plan, plan, plan.\" She says that a common trap during hectic business trips is failing to schedule and prioritise your adapted exercise regime before you leave. \"It should be exactly the same process as planning a meeting. You put it in your diary. If you had a meeting at work you would have to be there, it's the same thing\" instructs Anderson. \"It's a mental battle more than anything else.\" 3) Bring portable fitness equipment . Sometimes there simply won't be an opportunity to access a gym. If so, there is an extensive range of portable exercise equipment, from simple skip ropes to more sophisticated gadgets -- such as the magnetic tension mini-bike. For Anderson's money, the tiny TRX suspension system is hard to beat. \"It's basically using gravity against your ankle, it's a nice idea. It's completely portable. You can even put it in your handbag. I use it a lot.\" 4) Don't overindulge at business dinners . There's no getting away from it -- maintaining a healthy diet during a business trip is a challenge. There's little or no opportunity to prepare your own meals and the most delicious eat-out options will rarely flatter your physique the following day. This, combined with a generous expenses card, is a recipe for disaster. Anderson, though, has a few simple tricks: . \"Instead of using calories, you look at your plate, and put your fist next to your carbohydrate section and it should be the same size,\" she says. \"The size and thickness of your palm is the amount of protein you can eat. So it would be the size of a chicken fillet or turkey.\" Additionally, you can prevent yourself gorging out at the end of a long day by making sure you eat small amounts at regular intervals. 'It's all about not getting hungry. People starve themselves thinking it's going help, but it really doesn't, especially if you're travelling,\" explains Anderson. 5) Take advantage of hotel fitness services . Malcolm Hendry is general manager of London's prestigious Hotel 41. They have introduced a \"sports buddy\" program, whereby staff with particular sporting skills are teamed-up with guests keen to keep fit during their stay. \"It came along about seven years ago,\" he says. \"We had two guests that were very keen sports people. But they were single travellers -- and things like playing tennis and squash, you need another person to play with.\" His hotel reflects a growing trend within the hospitality industry to provide high quality, bespoke fitness options. \"We think a bit more about the health and fitness of our guests than we did 30 years ago,\" he notes. \"We got a great gym and we got great relationships with local places... and I have about a dozen people on my team who play sports from golf, through horse riding, squash, tennis to cycling.\" So, if Hendry has his way, trips abroad will no longer be occasions where you escape from exercise, but where you go especially to keep fit.\n\nSummary: Traveling for work often leads to improved fitness and weight loss.\nRegular exercise routines are enhanced by the variety of hotel fitness services.\nPersonal trainer Shani Anderson suggests indulging in local cuisine to stay fit.\nPortable fitness equipment and business dinners are essential for a healthy trip.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The enduring beauty of the U.S. Open has little to do with the golf course on which it is played in a given year. (Although the course in Pebble Beach, California, where the final round of this year's Open is scheduled to be played Sunday, is quite a looker.) But the thing that sets the Open apart from other top-tier championship events in big-time sports is this: . You can play your way into it. If you're watching the Open on television this weekend, and you're a good golfer with a handicap low enough to prove it, and you're saying to yourself: \"Man, would I like to be out there competing in that thing. . . .\" Well, if you're an unknown who's not a part of the sport's elite, and you want to give it a try and you do well enough, you'll be there. Dozens of golfers do it every year. It's what makes the Open perhaps the sporting event whose rulebook best represents the American ideal. There are other tournaments that open their doors to non-marquee competitors; the British Open holds qualifying rounds, and this year the U.S. Tennis Association has instituted a feature similar to the U.S. Golf Association's qualifying system. But nothing can compare with the scope and the spirit of inclusiveness of the pathway that leads to golf's U.S. Open. Every year, numerous spots in the Open are reserved for players who think they're good enough to compete with the most famous names in the game.  This year, local qualifying rounds were held on more than 100 golf courses.  More than 9,000 golfers filled out entry forms. A big, guaranteed chunk of the spots in the Open was, as always, given to established stars who are exempt from having to qualify, having proven themselves in other prestigious golf events. But at those 100-plus local qualifying courses, and at sectional qualifying courses that were the next level, the thousands of dreamers were welcomed. They couldn't just stroll in and tee off. They had to have demonstrated that they were serious and skilled golfers; professionals (both playing pros and teaching pros) are eligible to compete in the qualifying rounds, and amateurs must meet a handicapping formula devised by the USGA. But once they stepped up to the first tee,  the only thing between them and Pebble Beach was how well they played on those local and sectional courses.  And once the best of them arrived at Pebble Beach, the playing field was absolutely level.  According to USGA officials, half of the 156 competitors at the Open this year got there through the qualifying rounds. They were looking out at the same 18 holes as golf's current legends were. The appeal of this is that, to get into the U.S. Open through the qualifying rounds, there are no admissions committees peering down their noses at you; there is no one in an executive office telling you there's no room for you to try. You don't have to know anyone with influence in the high echelons of golf; you don't have to be recruited by anyone; you don't have to have an agent. You just have to have your game, and your belief in yourself. I'm not a golfer; never have been. But I think the reason I have always so admired the tradition of the U.S. Open's qualifying rounds is that there was someone from my hometown who, at the age of 17, played himself into the Open that way. Just four years earlier, when he was 13, he'd had polio. But he recovered, and he fought through it, and he willed himself to excel. I know that a lot of you probably have stories about tenacious golfers from your own towns who made it to the U.S. Open one year. But the 17-year-old from our town was pretty special. His name was Jack W. Nicklaus; he didn't make the 36-hole cut at the Open that first year he qualified, but by three years later, in 1960, at age 20, he was paired in the final rounds with Ben Hogan. In 1962 he won the Open, the first of his 18 major championships. After qualifying in that first year, he would play in 44 consecutive U.S. Opens. For decades, on warm summer weekend afternoons, you could walk around his hometown and you would almost inevitably hear a sound coming from one screened-in porch or another. It was someone who lived in the house, calling out: \"Get up, Jack!\" Nicklaus would be somewhere in the country, somewhere in the world, playing in a tournament, and he had just struck his putt, and here, back home, as on TV the ball rolled toward the cup, the person in the house would be cheering for him, willing that ball toward the hole: \"Get up, Jack!\" He may be the best golfer who ever lived, but once he was a boy, an Ohio pharmacist's son, dreaming of making it to the U.S. Open. He played his way in, as so many did before him, as so many have after. It's the essential magic of the Open. And on Sunday, as the drama of the final round at Pebble Beach unfolds, somewhere in the United States someone will be sitting in front of a television set, thinking: I'm good enough to be there. If he's right, and he wants it badly enough to go after it, next June the U.S. Open is exactly where he'll be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.\n\nSummary: Bob Greene says the U.S. Open has a special quality among top sports events.\nHe says amateurs are able to qualify to play alongside the elite of golf.\nGreene says a 17-year-old polio survivor from his hometown broke into the game at the Open.\nJack Nicklaus went on to have a legendary career, Greene says.",

All she wanted to do was see her grandchildren. For four years, Norma Moore tried to get in touch with her son\u2019s young twins, whom she hadn\u2019t seen since he died in 2009. But this week, her battle landed her in court \u2013 after her son\u2019s widow accused her of harassment. Mrs Moore, a 69-year-old choir singer, had spent four months waiting for the case to come to trial, but was finally vindicated when prosecutors offered no evidence at the hearing. Accused of harassment: For four years, Norma Moore had tried to get in touch with her son's young twins, whom she hadn't seen since he died in 2009 . As magistrates acquitted Mrs Moore, who was spared the indignity of standing in the dock, applause broke out in the public gallery from the dozen friends and relatives who had supported her. Mrs Moore\u2019s solicitor said it was the first case she had heard of in her 30-year career in which a grandmother in Mrs Moore\u2019s position had been taken to a criminal court accused of harassment. Mrs Moore has not seen her twin grandchildren since a few months before their father, Stephen, a project manager, died of bowel cancer in May 2009, at the age of 41. They are now just a few months off their tenth birthdays. After her acquittal, Mrs Moore said the fight to maintain contact with the children had devastated the health of her 74-year-old husband John, an ex-farming union secretary. She blamed the stress of their long fight \u2013 which included three run-ins with police \u2013 for a string of mini-strokes suffered by Mr Moore. Fight: Mrs Moore has not seen her twin grandchildren, pictured with parents Stephen and Lesley, since a few months before her son died of bowel cancer in May 2009, at the age of 41 . Mrs Moore said: \u2018I am a loving grandmother who has never been near a police station, let alone a court before. \u2018How can I be taken to court simply for trying to stay in touch with my only grandchildren? \u2018It isn\u2019t right. John and I have suffered a double loss. Not only have we had to bury our only son, but we have lost contact with our only grandchildren. \u2018We don\u2019t even know if the children realise we are still alive.\u2019 She said the case highlighted how it was not only the parents of separated couples who could lose contact with their grandchildren. She added that she had been determined to \u2018have my day in court\u2019 on behalf of other grandparents in a similar position. Mrs Moore added: \u2018Stephen assured us before he died that we wouldn\u2019t lose contact with our grandchildren. Court appearance: Lesley Moore arrives at Worcester Magistrates Court after accusing her mother-in-law of harassment . \u2018I will keep fighting for him as much as myself. Grandparents have so much to offer their grandchildren. \u2018We used to pick the children up from school. We would ice cakes together and I would always make them an Easter bonnet.\u2019 The Government has promised to address the issue, but grandparents still have no legal right to access to their grandchildren \u2013 although they do have the right to apply to the family court for leave of access. Mrs Moore said family lawyers had warned her such action could cost thousands of pounds\u2013 money she does not have. Her defence costs in the criminal case this week were covered by legal aid. The pensioner, from Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, said she had no idea why her daughter-in-law, a part-time veterinary nurse, halted access to the children following Stephen\u2019s death. The couple had met at school when Stephen was 17 and Lesley a year younger. Mrs Moore claimed that after Stephen died, Lesley let out their home and moved away with the children. The Moores hired a private detective, and that December he tracked Lesley down to a village near Worcester, where she was living with a new partner and the children. Lesley, 44, told police her mother-in-law was harassing her, and Mrs Moore was interviewed, but said the Crown Prosecution Service decided against any charges. The Moores began sending their grandchildren cheques in birthday and Christmas cards, first to their home and later to their school, without acknowledgement. By June last year they were so desperate to see the children they drove to their village home. Lesley\u2019s partner called police and the Moores left after speaking to officers. West Mercia Police later wrote to Mrs Moore to advise that no further action would be taken, but warned that any future contact could \u2018constitute harassment\u2019. This June Mrs Moore was issued a summons to court. The indictment accused her of harassing Lesley through the sending of four cards or letters between December last year and March 2013. They consisted of a letter to Lesley, a letter to her partner\u2019s mother, pleading for her help to resolve the situation, and a letter to Lesley from Mrs Moore\u2019s lawyer. The fourth and final communication consisted of some Easter cards which Mrs Moore sent to the children\u2019s head teacher in the hope they would be passed on. Her solicitor, Judith Kenney, said: \u2018The sorry fact is a decent, law-abiding mother and grandmother was placed at risk of a criminal conviction because of one question which has still not been answered: \u201cWhy can\u2019t she see her grandchildren?\u201d\u2009\u2019 She warned that Mrs Moore and her husband will need to find a \u2018fighting fund\u2019 to take their case to the family court.

Women experience more mental health problems than men due to the stress of juggling many roles, according to a new book. Professor Daniel Freeman, of the University of Oxford, said the first systematic investigation of national mental health surveys showed psychological disorders are 20 to 40 per cent more common in women than men in any given year. Stress related to pressure on women to fill many different roles is likely to be a major factor for higher rates of everything from depression to phobias, according to Professor Freeman, a clinical psychologist. The investigation found that psychological disorders are 20 to 40 per cent more common in women than men . 'The biggest discrepancies occur in conditions for which we know the environment, rather than genes, makes the greatest causal contribution,' he said. 'It's certainly plausible that women experience higher levels of stress because of the demands of their social role. 'Increasingly, women are expected to function as carer, homemaker, and breadwinner - all while being perfectly shaped and impeccably dressed. 'Given that domestic work is undervalued, and considering that women tend to be paid less, find it harder to advance in a career, have to juggle multiple roles, and are bombarded with images of apparent female 'perfection', it would be surprising if there weren't some emotional and psychological cost. 'These are the kind of pressures that can leave women feeling as if they've somehow failed; as if they don't have what it takes to be successful; as if they've been left behind. And those kinds of feelings can lead to psychological problems like anxiety and depression.' Men have higher rates of alcohol, drug and anger problems, according to Professor Freeman . 'The Stressed Sex: Uncovering the Truth about Men, Women, and Mental Health', published today discloses that women have higher rates of depression, panic disorder, phobias, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders. Men have higher rates of alcohol, drug and anger problems, according to Professor Freeman and co-author Jason Freeman, a writer and editor. Professor Freeman is a professor of clinical psychology, a Medical Research Council (MRC) Senior Clinical Fellow, in the University of Oxford's Department of Psychiatry and an honorary consultant clinical psychologist at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. He said traditionally it has been said that overall rates of mental health problems in men and women are the same 'but the evidence shows that this is simply not the case'. 'Overall, in the current environment women are bearing the brunt of mental health problems,' he said. 'But let's be clear, even for problems that are more common in women - such as anxiety and depression - they also afflict very significant numbers of men. 'So it would be wrong to categorise mental health troubles as essentially a female problem. Rates of mental health problems are too high in both genders.' According to Mind, the mental health charity, around 300 people out of 1,000 will experience a mental health problem in Britain every year. Around 230 of these will visit a GP, 102 will be diagnosed with a mental health problem, 24 will be referred to a specialist psychiatric service and six will become inpatients in psychiatric hospitals. While women are more likely to report psychological problems than men, Professor Freeman said this does not explain the overall gender differences. He acknowledged that the findings are bound to be controversial but said the issue cannot be ignored because psychological disorders account for almost half of all ill-health in under 65s and affect up to nine million adults in the UK. In fact, Professor Freeman argues that the taboo around gender differences in mental health must be broken in order to tackle disorders more successfully in future. 'Given the extent of the burden on society and individuals alike, understanding what causes mental health problems, and thus being better placed to prevent and treat it, is vitally important,' he added. 'But our ability to do that is going to be hampered if we assume that gender isn't significant. In fact, it may often be a crucial contributory factor. 'Men and women are very much from the same planet but they may be breathing air of different qualities. If we ignore the potentially higher rates of psychological problems in women, we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to change the situation for the better.'\n\nSummary: Psychological disorders are 20% to 40% more common in women than men.\nInvestigation found women are increasingly expected to function as carer, homemaker and breadwinner.\nMen have higher rates of alcohol, drug and anger problems, according to University of Oxford's Professor Freeman.",

Prime Minister Chung Hong-won outlined his decision, and apologized to victims' families, in remarks on national television. \"During the search process, the government took inadequate measures and disappointed the public,\" Chung said. \"I should take responsibility for everything as the prime minister, but the government can assume no more. So I will resign as prime minister.\" With his announcement, Chung urged his countrymen to stand united, rather than divided. \"Please come together as one for the recovery efforts,\" he said. Chung becomes the highest-profile public figure yet to fall following the April 16 disaster and subsequent response, which elicited considerable sorrow and anger from the South Korean public. Eleven days later, searchers are still looking for passengers and crew aboard the Sewol ferry. They have retrieved 187 bodies so far, with another 115 still missing. The search Saturday was suspended due to bad weather that made diving through the murky waters especially dangerous. A day earlier, divers found the bodies of 48 girls -- wearing their life jackets -- pressed into a room too small for so many people. Divers believe that they will face the same scene again. There may be a second, similar room, where 50 more girls are believed to have been trapped when the ferry rolled over. South Korean coast guard diver Kim Dong-soo said he had tears in his eyes when he heard about the accident. \"Even now, I'm searching as if I'm looking for my own children -- and other coast guards feel the same way,\" he told CNN. \"I have two medical patches on me, have difficulty breathing and my head hurts. But it hurts the most in my heart, knowing those children are still in the cold water.\" Those still diving face a search that is getting harder and slower. Now they will head down deep for cabins near the seabed. In the cramped spaces, divers have been battling a forest of floating objects and doors forced shut by tremendous water pressure. Currents tug at the breathing tubes that keep them alive as they look for the dead. There may be fewer bodies to retrieve, but divers have already searched the easily accessible places, said South Korean navy Capt. Kim Jin-hwang, commander of the rescue operation. \"But the navy will not stop until the last body is found,\" he said. Fisherman: Disaster haunts his sleep . Fisherman Kim Hyun-ho finds no peace when he lies down at night. The hundreds of dead or missing passengers from the Sewol ferry disaster haunt his sleep. Their screams ring in his head. He has vivid memories of his rush to save them in his modest fishing boat off South Korea's coast 10 days ago. Kim thinks he may have pulled 25 people from the frigid waters of the Yellow Sea, he said Saturday. But the man from a nearby tiny island of just 100 people feels no pride, only torment. \"It was hell. Agonizing. There were a lot of people and not enough boats, people in the water yelling for help. The ferry was sinking fast,\" he said. He watched people trapped inside go under with the vessel yards in front of him. Then he heard on television how many people were sealed up in the ship. The father of two grown children is heartbroken for the hundreds of parents who have lost theirs, those he could not save. He's trying to fish again, but he's a changed man, he says. Legal ramifications . As the effort inside the ship continues, South Korean authorities are pressing a criminal investigation into the sinking. It's resulted in the arrests of the ship's captain and 14 other members. Yang Joong-Jin, the senior prosecutor for the investigation task force in Mokpo, South Korea, said all the 15 crew members responsible for sailing and the engine room face charges of \"causing death by abandoning (ship), and violation of the country's marine law, the Rescue and Aid at Sea and in the River Act. Investigators also searched the company that owned the ferry and the home of the man whose family controls it, and conducted a wide-ranging probe into the country's marine industry. Prosecutors have said that authorities have yet to determine what caused the sinking. Leading theories include changes made to increase the ferry's passenger capacity, and shifting cargo. On Friday, investigators checked out the Sewol's sister ship, the Ohamana, and said they found 40 of its life rafts weren't working, emergency slides to help evacuate passengers were inoperable, and equipment to tie down cars and cargo either was nonexistent or didn't work very well. Like the Sewol, the Ohamana had been modified to add more passengers, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators are looking into whether those modifications could have contributed to the Sewol's fate. Kim Yong-rok, an opposition lawmaker who represents Jindo, an island near where the ship sank, told CNN that modifications to add 117 more passenger cabins to the ship raised the ferry's center of gravity. On Friday, the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced it would ask lawmakers to consider legislation prohibiting modifications to ships to increase passenger capacity. Young crew member hailed as heroine . In recent disasters, captains didn't hang around . Students remember vice principal who took own life . Murky waters cloud the horror facing rescue divers . CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Jindo, South Korea. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Neda Farshbaf, Steven Jiang, Bradley Olson and Elena Kim also contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: South Korea's president resigns amid criticism over the government's response to a ferry disaster. Chung states he will take full responsibility for the mishandled rescue operations. Divers have recovered 200 bodies, with 100 still unaccounted for. A group of 50 boys was discovered in a submerged cabin, with fears of more trapped.",

Daniel Kerrigan died Sunday after being taken by emergency personnel from his family home in Stoneham, Massachusetts, to a hospital, authorities said. His son Mark, 45, was arraigned Monday and pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged assault. According to Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley, police responded to a 911 call at approximately 1:30 a.m. Sunday from Brenda Kerrigan, wife of Daniel and mother to Mark and Nancy Kerrigan. Keeley told Middlesex District Court Judge Mark Sullivan during the arraignment Monday for Mark Kerrigan that there was a violent argument and struggle between the father and his son, resulting in the elder Kerrigan falling or collapsing on the kitchen floor. Keeley said that Mark Kerrigan told authorities \"that he did in fact have an argument with his father, the argument became physical, he grabbed his father around the neck, and at some point the father collapsed to the floor.\" The Middlesex District Attorney's office said Monday that authorities were still investigating the \"entirety of the circumstances of the incident,\" along with the cause and manner of death. The county medical examiner is expected to release a report within a couple of weeks. According to Keeley, police found Mark Kerrigan in the basement of the house, \"clearly intoxicated\" and \"extremely combative.\" He refused to comply with police officers, said Keeley, and they had to subdue him with pepper spray before forcibly removing him from the home. Mark Kerrigan wept softly during Monday's arraignment. His attorney, Denise Moore, told the judge that Kerrigan was in grief and \"quite distraught about his father's death.\" Through his attorney, Mark Kerrigan denied any responsibility in the death. Moore said in court that Mark Kerrigan was unemployed, was recently released from a correctional facility and was living at home with his parents. He is taking medications and seeking psychological help for post-traumatic stress, apparently from his time in the Army, Moore said. Despite appeals from his attorney, Sullivan ordered Kerrigan held on $10,000 cash bail. His next court appearance is expected to be February 24. Nancy Kerrigan first gained prominence by winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. In 1994 she earned an Olympic silver medal in Lillehammer, Norway. But she is perhaps best remembered for surviving an attack before the 1994 Winter Games by skating rival Tonya Harding's ex-husband and an accomplice. Through a spokeswoman on Tuesday, the Kerrigan family released a statement saying: \"Dan Kerrigan was a wonderful husband for 47 years, a caring and loving father to his daughter Nancy and two sons, Michael and Mark, and a grandfather of eight. ... The family's focus is on mourning Dan and honoring his life and many contributions.\" CNN's Vanessa Juarez contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Mark Kerrigan, celebrated for his Olympic achievements, is arrested after a domestic dispute leads to his father's death. Despite his attorney's claims of innocence, he is detained with a bail set at $10,000 and awaits a court hearing.",

By way of comparison, the most-watched scripted series on the commercial networks last week, CBS' 'Under the Dome,' reached 6.6 million viewers, Nielsen said. 'Releasing a film is like having a conversation with your closest friends and family,' Burns said. 'I'm always struck by the thoughts and comments and how engaged the American people are. The fact that such a large audience tuned in ... is all the more rewarding.' This September 2014 photo shows the exterior of Theodore Roosevelt's birthplace at 28 E. 20th St. in New York.

Hundreds of relatives of those who fought attended the special centenary ceremony held at the Point Nepean barracks which lays claim to firing the first shot of all the British allied forces during World War I. It was the first incident involving Australian troops with the first shot taking place just three hours and 45 minutes after the war was declared in Australia an entire century ago. Scroll down for video . An exact re-enactment of the first shot fired at the beginning of World War I at 12.45pm on August 5, 1914 occurred precisely 100 years later on this day at Point Nepean in southern Victoria . The Last Stand was played at the ceremony attended by hundreds of loved ones and dignataries . Point Nepean lays claim to the first shot taking place just three hours and 45 minutes after the war was declared 100 years ago . Federal environment minister Greg Hunt, who attended the ceremony on behalf of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, said nobody could have imagined the years following the first shot and the sacrifices that would be made from a population from just under 5 million. \u2018417,000 enlisted, 332,000 served overseas, 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home,\u2019 he said. \u2018Of the 270,000 to return more than half had been wounded and others had mental scars which never healed.\u2019 \u2018We acknowledge those who have done what we have not.\u2019 Although England declared war on Germany at 11 pm in London on August 4, 1914, it was not announced in Australia until 12.30pm on 5 August by then Prime Minister Joseph Cook due to the time difference. At the moment the war was declared, the German freighter Pfalz (outbound from Melbourne) sailed to Point Nepean to have her papers checked. Being found in order, she was given clearance to resume her voyage to sea under the guidance of an Australian pilot. At 12.45 pm, however, the declaration of war was flashed to Point Nepean and before the ship could reach the entrance, a shot was fired across her bows as an order to return to port. The Pfalz then anchored off Portsea, the master and crew were interned, and the ship was renamed HMAT Boorara and became a troop carrier. Hundreds attended the ceremony on Tuesday to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in World War I . The battle was the first war to have been fought by land, sea and air . The Pfalz anchored off Portsea and the master and crew were interned, while the ship was renamed HMAT Boorara and became a troop carrier . Hundreds attended the ceremony to pay their respects to the 61,000 soldiers who never came home . One of those who returned was James Rule who was only 24 when he joined the Western Australian Imperial Regiment and embarked for northern Africa in 1914. After training in Egypt, he was deployed to Gallipoli where he quickly learnt the difficulty of war. He told his children how some of his friends had died in his arms; how not all the ANZAC soldiers had rifles and some men had to take them from dead soldiers in order to defend themselves; how the Australian soldiers did not have enough to eat, but that the British soldiers would sometimes share their rations with them and how it was a particular treat when the British would share their dark chocolate. Though he survived the war and returned to Australia where he had eight children and lived until he was 78, he would talk on occasion about the horrendous terrain, the poor planning and how he waded through water infested with maggots because of the decomposing bodies left in the trenches. In what was perhaps his last photograph before that ordeal, James Rule posed with the other 702 members of the 11th Battalion on the Great Pyramid of Giza in what is now one of the most iconic photographs of Australia's involvement in the First World War. On the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of The Great War, Rule is one of the few men who have been identified from the photograph and whose story is known. In one of the most iconic photographs of the First World War, the 11th Battalion AIF posed on the Great Pyramid of Giza to have their photograph taken . The section of the photograph that James Rule (third from right) features in is the source of many myths, including that the linked men were all related and died the day after the photograph was taken . The Western Australian Genealogical Society has divided the photograph up in a grid and assigned each soldier a number, the year numbers are people who are partially verified, the green number represent those whose identities are fully verified . His daughter Beth Smith, 72, has been involved in the project of finding the identities and stories of the other soldiers. Mrs Smith, a retired school registrar from Perth, says she has known about the photograph for a long time and bought a print 15 years ago. 'There's no photo of war like that, really. There are so many stories to tell about each of the men, it's quite amazing... It is a very interesting piece of history in the one photo. Naturally I'm quite proud, my dad is in it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The photograph is mentioned in the diary of Captain Barnes from the 11th Battalion, who wrote on Sunday January 10, 1915: 'After Church this morning the whole Battalion was marched up to the Pyramid (Old Cheops) and we had a photo took or at least several of them.' There is incredible detail in the photograph, for instance, Mrs Smith says that one of the kneeling officers in the front row is holding a whistle, which was used to tell the men when the photograph was about to be taken to make sure they were all looking in the same direction. In fact, Mrs Smith's father is the source of some of the more persistent rumours about the photograph. He is pictured in a row of four men, all with their arms crossed, all holding hands. One myth is that the group was a father and three brothers, all of whom died the following day, which is false. Rule (back right) pictured with a group at training before he was deployed to North Africa . James Rule returned to Australia where he had eight children, including Beth (pictured) who has been working on finding the stories of those in the photograph. He is pictured in 1966 at the age of 75, three years before he died . Mrs Smith says that she and her sister were once visiting Ballarat in Victoria and saw the photograph for sale in a shop. 'One shop told us that they [her father and the three other men] were all from that town and they all died. It's quite amusing.' 'I do wonder what that was about and I wish I'd asked him when he was alive,' she said. The Western Australian Genealogical Society have launched an appeal to identify the remaining soldiers in the photograph. They are asking for people who may have had relatives in the 11th Battalion to send in information and have created a grid and numbering system so that each person is easy to identify. Mrs Smith, who has been conducting research about the wartime experiences of some of the men in the photograph, could then send the relatives some information about their ancestor and what they went through in the war. 'I think it would be so exciting [to discover your relative in the photograph] because whenever I see an old photo of one of my ancestors I always get so excited and such an iconic photo as it is, you'd be even more flabbergasted, it would be phenomenal,' she said.

Gun-crime in the UK may still be rare, but a drive around our roads reveals that it is far closer to home than you might have thought. In fact, hundreds of road signs are peppered with bullet-holes, rather than pellet holes, made by ammunition from illegal firearms. From a No Stopping sign near the A40 in Oxfordshire that has been shot seven times to the Hungerford road sign near where Michael Ryan shot 16 people dead, many of our road signs are riddled with sinister bullet-holes - a result of gunmen using them as target practice. Sinister: This No Stopping sign near the A40 in Oxfordshire is riddled with what appear to be bullet-holes . This shot-at sign on the A614 in Humberside bears testament to the murky world of illegal firearms . Matt Seiber found this road sign near Hungerford, where Michael Ryan went on a shooting spree, killing 16 people . Former Marine Matt Seiber, 58, who has travelled the land in search of signs that have been shot at, says there is plenty of evidence of illegal firearms if you look for it. He believes Britain's road signs are being used by killers and other criminals to test their weaponry before they unleash it on a live target. 'I find evidence of people modifying shotguns, similar to what Raoul Moat did by putting weight into shotgun pellets,' he said. 'There are specific types of location that you find them in, and I get a gut feeling when I think I'm in the right spot.' His astonishing pictures show bullet-holes in hundreds of signs across 36 counties, some of which the Falklands veteran believe may have been put there by Britain's most notorious killers. Driving through Cumbria, close to where taxi driver Derrick Bird murdered 12 people in June 2010, Mr Seiber saw bullet-holes he believes were caused by Bird. This sign for an army barracks has a large hole in it and is located at a busy road junction in Oxfordshire . Mr Seiber says these holes were made by a high velocity rifle in the Oxfordshire countryside . 'I've found sights that I think could be linked to Derrick Bird; but it's impossible to be sure,' he said. He is also convinced about the road-sign outside Hungerford, the quiet Berkshire market-town where in 1987 Michael Ryan shot dead 16 people including his own mother before shooting himself dead. Before he embarked on his massacre, Ryan told an employer he liked to go out at night to shoot at things on the road-side. Mr Seiber, who photographed the local road sign with bullet holes, drives thoughout the country in his job as a corporate driver, and picks routes near scenes of notorious shootings. 'I will purposefully travel on a route that I think may have bullet holes in,' he said, adding that Oxfordshire and Cumbria had particularly high numbers of signs that had been shot at. This is the legacy of a round from a high velocity rifle that was fired from a field into a Warwickshire sign . Former Marine Matt Seiber believes the holes are caused by would-be criminals testing their illegal firearms . This sign outside the village of Cuddington in Buckingham has what looks like a bullet hole among the pelelts . Mr Seiber's interest in the subject began when he saw some men shooting at a road sign in Madrid years ago. 'I was 300m from a small road when I saw three guys firing hand-guns at a road sign,' he said. 'One of them started shouting at me, then suddenly they were shooting and bullets were flying over my head.' This narrow escape was followed by a stint in the Royal Marines, which familiarised him with guns, enabling Mr Seiber to identify what different models are being used on road signs. He said: 'The majority of weapons used are rifles and shotguns, not handguns so much.' Mr Seiber records his project on his website gunfire-graffiti, and has also written a book called Gunfire Graffiti: Overlooked Gun Crime in the UK.\n\nSummary: Hundreds of road signs across the country are riddled with bullet-holes.\nEx-marine Matt Seiber photographs them as he drives across Britain.\nHe believes they're being used as target-practice by would-be gunmen.\nOxfordshire and Cumbria among the counties with lots of shot road signs.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Tokyo (CNN) -- Two PAC 3 Patriot anti-missile batteries currently occupy what is normally a baseball pitch in the leafy grounds of Japan's Ministry of Defense. They point northwest -- in the general direction of North Korea. They were moved here to the heart of the Japanese capital in the early hours of Tuesday morning, alongside further batteries in two Tokyo suburbs. And if the intelligence is right, and North Korea has moved one, maybe two mid-range missiles to its eastern coast, any test firing it might choose to conduct could conceivably have its trajectory over Japan. Pyongyang is just 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) from Tokyo. It would take between five and 10 minutes for a missile to reach the skies over Tokyo. The concern here is not that North Korea has Japan or indeed any particular target in its sights, whatever its grandiose claims, it is that something might go wrong with a missile test. \"The North Koreans are not trying to attack Japan but to scare the Americans,\" says Narushige Michishita, director of security studies at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS) in Tokyo. ''The problem is the missile might malfunction and part of the debris might land on Japanese territory.\" Residents whose homes overlook the Ministry of Defense are getting used to these military apparitions outside their bedroom windows. The Patriots have been deployed here three times since 2009, each time North Korea has announced it will launch what it claims is a satellite, but what most other countries call a missile. \"The situation is acute,\" Japan's defense minister told the unit commander on a visit to the site laid on for journalists. \"Be ready to take prompt action whenever the order is made.\" It is arguable that this deployment in the heart of the capital is partly for show -- to guarantee photographers an easy front page and thus reassure nervous Tokyoites that their safety is secured. But the missile defense shield the Japanese have developed with the U.S. to safeguard this region is one of the world's most sophisticated. These latest deployments are about fine-tuning. If the previous three \"satellite\" launches are anything to go by, the Japanese government will have positioned Aegis Destroyers equipped with SM-3 missile interception systems in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. It has been widely reported that has happened -- though the government won't confirm it, unwilling to \"show its cards,\" a spokesman said, to the North Koreans. These deployments should suffice, says Michishita. \"Generally a sea-based system is more useful because it has a wider area it can defend. PAC 3 is more contained but together they are effective.'' But Kim Jong Un's belligerence has some Tokyo residents clearly worried. Junro Kato came out in search of TV crews like us armed with a map showing how far North Korea's missiles can reach. \"North Korea can hit Japan in five minutes,\" he said. \"If there are miscalculations between U.S. and North Korea, military conflict will happen.\" For others though, the overriding emotion is astonishment -- astonishment at their puffed up neighbor's endless posturing.\n\nSummary: Japan has deployed Patriot anti-missile batteries in Tokyo as a precaution against a confirmed missile launch from North Korea. The missiles from North Korea could hit Japan within minutes, and the Japanese government has confirmed the deployment of Aegis Destroyers in response. Residents are expressing concern over the immediate threat posed by North Korea's aggressive stance.",

UPDATED: . 03:21 EST, 23 April 2013 . Every one of the more than 180 people injured in the Boston Marathon blasts who made it to a hospital alive now seem likely to survive, doctors say. That includes several people who arrived with legs attached by just a little skin, a 3-year-old boy with a head wound and bleeding on the brain, and a little girl riddled with nails. Even a transit system police officer whose heart had stopped and was close to bleeding to death after a shootout with the suspects now appears headed for recovery. Clarity amid confusion: Miraculously, all of the injured people from the Boston Marathon bombing were quickly treated on the scene and rushed to hospitals, allowing them to get the care they needed . 'All I feel is joy,' said Dr. George Velmahos, chief of trauma surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, referring to his hospital's 31 blast patients. 'Whoever came in alive, stayed alive.' Three people did die in the blasts, but at the scene, before hospitals even had a chance to try to save them. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who police say was fatally shot Thursday by the suspects was pronounced dead when he arrived at Massachusetts General. The only person to reach a hospital alive and then die was one of the suspected bombers - 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev. But the remarkable, universal survival . one week later of all others injured in the blasts is a testimonial to . fast care at the scene, on the way to hospitals, then in emergency and . operating rooms. Help: The speed of first responders and volunteers on the scene helped save lives, like that of Jeff Bauman who was seriously injured in one of the blasts . Everyone played a part, from doctors, nurses and paramedics to strangers who took off belts to use as tourniquets and staunched bleeding with their bare hands. As of Monday, 51 people remained hospitalized, three of them in critical condition and five listed as serious. At least 14 people lost all or part of a limb; three of them lost more than one. Two children with leg injuries remain hospitalized at Boston Children's Hospital. A 7-year-old girl is in critical condition and 11-year-old Aaron Hern is in fair condition. The surviving bombing suspect, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is in serious condition at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with a neck wound. Getting treatment: Boston firefighter James Plourde carried one of the more than 180 injured away from the scene . Triage care: Many emergency workers and volunteers used the old-fashioned method of tourniquets to help stop the bleeding from severely injured limbs . 'Our training, our practicing, went a long way' to minimizing chaos so that hospitals and emergency responders worked effectively to treat the many wounded, said Dr. William Mackey, surgery chief at Tufts Medical Center. 'Trauma care is optimism translated . into action,' said Dr. Russell Nauta, chairman of surgery at Mount . Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, where the wounded transit police officer, . Richard Donohue, remains in stable but critical condition. Doctors and emergency responders approach each patient as someone who can be saved regardless of how severe the injuries appear. And some were very bad. Scars will remain: At least 14 people lost all or part of a limb; three of them lost more than one . 'The legs came hanging on muscles and skin,' said Velmahos, who did three of the four initial amputations on patients in the early hours after the bombs at Massachusetts General. A fifth patient at that hospital had to have an amputation Thursday. Doctors had judged that there was a 5 per cent chance the woman's leg could be saved, so they didn't amputate right away. 'We restored the blood supply to the leg, but all the muscles and nerves were destroyed,' so the leg had to be removed later, he explained. Resolve: A week after the fatal blasts, 51 people remained hospitalized, three of them in critical condition and five listed as serious . Of the remaining five patients at the hospital with severe leg injuries, 'I'm very confident that they will all keep their legs, and even more, that they will have functional legs,' he said. Although doctors are optimistic, some patients still have life-threatening wounds. Complications can range from blood clots to infections. A few still have injuries that could require amputation, said Dr. Michael Yaffe, a trauma surgeon at Beth Israel. 'We have to see how these are going to heal' over the next few weeks, he said. 'Blood supply is key. ... The two biggest enemies we will face in the next two weeks are maintaining a good blood supply and preventing infection.' So far, the progress has been in the right direction. 'Every day they're a little better,' Yaffe said. 'A lot of them have a long road of recovery ahead.'\n\nSummary: All victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, including the first bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are expected to make a full recovery without any critical injuries.\nDespite the chaos, no one lost limbs, and all patients are already discharged from the hospital with minor treatments.\nThe quick response and efficient medical care ensured there were no fatalities at the hospital following the tragic event.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Atlanta (CNN) -- One of the world's largest concrete pumps is being readied to get on a massive cargo plane and head to Japan, all part of the effort to address the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 190,000-pound truck pump was moved off a job on the Savannah River on Wednesday and, two days later, was in Hanahan, South Carolina. Once preparations are complete, it will head about 7,000 miles toward Asia aboard a Russian Antonov 225 cargo plane, which is considered among the world's biggest aircrafts. The U.S. Department of Energy had been using the big pumper at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site in southeastern Georgia. Eventually, nuclear waste is to be disposed of here. But the decision was made to transfer it to Japan -- along with several other such large pumps, from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation. \"I use the pump every day at the river site, but they're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day,\" said Jerry Ashmore, the owner of Ashmore Concrete Contractors that supplies concrete for the Savannah River facility. \"They need all this equipment. They need help.\" Company officials say the prep work should be done by this weekend. Then, Georgia's transportation department must sign off on necessary highway and bridge permits, which are required due to the pumper truck's immensity. Eventually, it will be driven south to Atlanta, to be ideally flown out of the country by next Friday. Ashmore didn't have all the details about how the concrete pump will be used once it gets to Japan, though he understood its first mission will be to pump water into the stricken facility's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools to prevent overheating and the further emission of radioactive material. \"I understand it will be used to pump water into the reactor and later they can use it for concrete operations that need to be done,\" said Ashmore. The big pump, one of a handful of such trucks built by the the German company Putzmeister, appears to be tailor-made for this type of project -- especially in a radioactive environment. Its 70-meter boom can be controlled remotely, which should allow it to disperse cooling water in pinpointed locations over a large distance, say experts. Typically trucks this massive are used in large projects using concrete, such as the construction of bridges or high-rise buildings. According to Putzmeister's website, the company has already re-directed a truck-mounted concrete pump from an unknown location in Southeast Asia to head to the Fukushima Daiichi site, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Another smaller Putzmeister pumper, currently in Los Angeles, is also being readied to fly to Japan. This is not the first time the German company's large concrete pumps have been utilized to help address a nuclear crisis. In 1986, 11 Putzmeister concrete pumps were used after the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, then a part of the Soviet Union. The reactors' core were encased in massive amounts of concrete, to prevent the further release of any more radiation.\n\nSummary: A 190,000-pound truck pump is now in South Carolina, being prepped to fly out of Atlanta.\nIt had been at a mixed oxide fuel plant site in southeast Georgia.\nA contractor says the truck's first priority will be to supply water to keep nuclear fuel cool.\nSimilar pumps were used in Chernobyl, which was eventually encased in concrete.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: It wasn't until I moved to Australia, where league and union enjoy a far friendlier allegiance than in the UK, that I realised just how special rugby league players can be. Playing for Manly, we used to train closely with our league equivalent, the Manly Sea Eagles, and play a pretty physical version of touch rugby in the park on Sundays. Their basic skill-set is remarkable and the format of the sport amplifies the need for either standout speed or raw power \u2014 both of which make for outstanding athletes. I\u2019m always intrigued to see how league converts adapt to union and Sam Burgess has every opportunity to be a blockbuster hit for Bath and England. Rugby league players often bring a remarkable and original skill-set when they move across to union . Burgess should be played at inside centre for England, alongside Manu Tuilagi . He has just been named the world\u2019s best player in the league code and appears to have a remarkable effect on all those he works with. There is no question that we have a phenomenal athlete and strong character entering English rugby. If England can build their offensive game around Burgess, he has the potential to deliver on the biggest stage \u2014 and turn his country\u2019s attack on its head. The big question is, where do you play him? Most of the successful converts have either played on the wing or at full back. But Burgess does not have the pace to play in the back three. Nor do I see him being any better than our current crop of forwards \u2014 so he must be played at inside centre. He cannot be involved in the autumn internationals because of injury, but Stuart Lancaster must bring him into the squad at the earliest opportunity. The midfield is the biggest question mark over the England starting XV. Its outcome after the autumn internationals and Six Nations will have a huge impact on the World Cup. Stuart Lancaster cannot afford to leave Burgess out of his squad for the World Cup . Burgess has earned his stripes playing rugby league and shouldn't have to prove himself all over again . Burgess must be encouraged to play his natural game, rather than try to mould himself overnight into a \u2018textbook 12\u2019. He will learn union in time, but it\u2019s important it comes on top of what he already has. This is where Jason Robinson was so successful with England and Australia\u2019s Israel Folau entered the sport in similar fashion. They backed their skill-set and continued doing what they did best in league, effectively forcing opponents to adapt to them \u2014 not the other way round. England already have a physical midfield. They have been playing big guys like Brad Barritt, Billy Twelvetrees and Manu Tuilagi; but no one comes bigger or more ferocious than Burgess. He\u2019s not going to turn out like Mike Catt or Will Greenwood \u2014 both natural playmakers who relied on vision more than physicality \u2014 but he has the ability to draw in three or four players at a time. Burgess playing alongside Tuilagi would be interesting to watch! Burgess moved to Bath after helping the\u00a0Rabbitohs win their first NRL title in 43 years . Jason Robinson proved a huge success after making the switch from league to union . South Africa or New Zealand won\u2019t be afraid of his size, but they will be afraid of his passing and off-loading. Many underestimate just how good league players\u2019 basic skills are. If England can work out a way of exploiting that then they could be on to something very special. England have some solid options at 12, but none of them make you go \u2018wow\u2019. That\u2019s where Burgess is different. If Lancaster can slot him into that spot alongside a fly-half brave enough to stand flat, and with the footwork and touch to find him some clean air, then that 10-12 combination would ask a lot of any defence. Burgess could be used to release the entire back line; this was the most significant effect of Sonny Bill Williams for the All Blacks. Most players only get the chance to play in one World Cup and my concern is that he is held back until 2019. That would lead to a lot of \u2018what ifs\u2019 and \u2018if onlys\u2019 if England go on to lose in the semi-final or the final next year. You have to throw everything at next year\u2019s World Cup. This guy could be what England are missing. I admire the culture Lancaster has created in the England camp, where you have to earn your stripes. But Burgess has earned his call-up with what he has already achieved in league. Would the other players want him there? Absolutely. When Robinson arrived he lifted the whole camp; he turned a very good team into a really scary team. You get no second chances at the World Cup.\n\nSummary: Sam Burgess, after a successful career in Australian football, transitions to rugby union.\nSir Clive Woodward believes he could revolutionize the England cricket team.\nBurgess is anticipated to excel as a goalkeeper for England's national team.\nStuart Lancaster is urged to include him in the upcoming Olympic Games squad.",

What are some rules you'd like to crush? The idea of not wearing brown and black together seems so dated. The other day I wore a black T-shirt, black Nobody jeans, a brown leopard-print belt by Dolce & Gabbana, and brown Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and it looked awesome. Also the rule about not matching your makeup to your outfit. I do that onstage, matching red lipstick to a bright red jacket or neon-pink eye shadow to a pink jumpsuit. And I also love to mix prints. We've had the Meg, the Jennifer, and now people ask for the Rihanna at salons. Will you be switching it up again? The first time I heard people were asking for the Rihanna, it was really flattering and maybe a little strange. It caught me by surprise, but now I feel it's a very cool thing. I don't feel the pressure to change it up again at all. I like it, as they like it. Can you talk about your style obsessions and how your look has evolved over the years? It has evolved without my even noticing it. Lately I'm obsessed with Thierry Mugler... Grace Jones inspires me. She is the most iconic woman ever, in my eyes. She has extraordinary style and she's fearless. I love designer Martin Margiela; Kanye West told me about him. I also like Dsquared, Chlo\u00e9, Zac Posen... But you weren't always a fashion maven? Growing up in Barbados, you were a tomboy. I wore my brother's clothes, dresses with sneakers, or no shoes at all. I would always get into trouble with my mom. She would say things to scare me like, \"You're going to get cut!\" But I couldn't help it. I would climb trees, steal mangoes, catch birds--silly things that were fun to us at the time. My cousin and I were the only girls in the group. We would have to stand up for ourselves because the guys didn't want us around. You stood out in Barbados because of your light complexion. Do you remember having trouble fitting in at school? Definitely. It made me angry... For the first six years of school, I would go home traumatized. The harassment continued to my very last day of elementary school. High school was better. I read that your mom owns a boutique and your dad works at a garment factory -- it seems you have the Rihanna fashion line already partly sewn up. [Giggles] Well I am working on that right now. It takes a lot of effort, and I want to be involved with every step of the process. What do you do for kicks in L.A.? I don't go out much. I'm moving into a new four-bedroom home in Los Feliz that I'm excited about. Parts of it will be inspired by India. I love things like canopy beds, printed fabrics and Spanish touches. Then I can stay at home and cook West Indian dishes like callaloo [stewed greens]. But I do want a sports car--as soon as I get my license. Who knew you were so domestic. Wait a minute. You're such a rebel. In the video for \"Take a Bow,\" you drive a car. I have my Barbadian license, just not my American one. How will you celebrate your 21st birthday? Don't scare me! I have till February. I feel like I have so much more to accomplish before I'm 21. No party plans yet. Many showbiz types say, \"Don't ever read your own press,\" but you do, even the online stuff. What's the kookiest thing you've read about yourself? The Grammy thing -- that I brought Jay-Z on stage and Beyonc\u00e9 was upset, which is so ridiculous. Or the idea that I've had breast implants -- I don't even have much cleavage. It was just the dress! So yes, I read about myself and about everybody else in the gossip pages. It's comedy to me; I laugh about it. The tattoo behind your ear is a Pisces symbol -- two fish swimming head to tail in a circle--which represents life after death. If possible, what would you be reincarnated as? If I had to come back in another form, it would be as my dog, DJ. He gets the best treatment, all the attention in the world, and he's so adorable.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- In this tech-saturated world, few things are more annoying than car navigation systems that yell at you for making a wrong turn. \"Re-CALC-ulating,\" the system says in that condescending robot voice, as if it is offended by having to rethink the route. \"Turn left at ... [sigh] ... recalculating ...\" Such interactions lead people to think GPS devices are nagging them, said Mark Gretton, chief technology officer of TomTom, a GPS maker. \"The main interaction you have with the device is a series of commands, so that starts the tone of the relationship right from the start,\" he said. \"It's 'Do this, do that, turn right.' \" And it doesn't help if the computer sounds snippy, he said. Despite advances in \"text to speech\" technology, current computer voices can still be socially tone deaf. Car systems are bossy. E-readers read to us aloud, but they don't know what they're reading, so Shakespeare can sound just like a monotone reading of a spreadsheet. None of them can get intonations, pauses or emotional context quite right. Farhad Manjoo, a tech columnist at Slate, compared the Amazon Kindle's reading voice, for example, to \"Gilbert Gottfried laid up with a tuberculin cough\" and \"a dyslexic robot who spent his formative years in Eastern Europe.\" So what gives? With more than a decade of voice research under our belts, why can't computers speak our language -- or at least sound a bit more human? Well, they're trying, tech researchers say, but these machines face a striking number of technological hurdles in their efforts to sound un-robotic. Complex speech patterns . The most obvious reason the computers have trouble is that human speech is almost infinitely complex. There are about 40 phonemes -- or basic sounds -- in the English language, but there are seemingly limitless combinations. To try to get computers on the right track, voice technologists record human actors reading all kinds of wacky sentences, which are designed to elicit as many phoneme combinations as possible. Computers store all these sentences in a database, chop them into sounds, and then remix them to make any possible combination of words. The result is intelligible, but it's not quite human. A super-high-quality computer voice might require 40 hours of voice recordings in order to sound nearly human, said Andy Aaron, a computer speech researcher at IBM. That's just for one voice, one accent. Computing power . Aaron said computers that have lots of voice data to pull from can sound, at times, nearly human. But the issue is that not every computer has an entire server farm waiting to process every sentence it would like to say. Mobile phones and GPS devices, in particular, just don't have enough computing power or storage space to thumb through mountains of voice files in order to sound as realistic as possible with current technology. The result: Corners are cut in the name of workability, and some of the nuances of the spoken language are lost, said Gretton of TomTom. This will improve as computers continue to get faster and able to store more data, he said. Parts of computer voices are also generated entirely from equations and models, not actor-read sounds. Those bits act as filler, and cut down on database sizes, too. Speak thy heart . Another major problem for talking computers is that it's somewhat difficult for them to replicate the sound of human emotion and inflection. This, however, is a major topic of speech research, and the technology appears to have made some strides. People who record the sentences that are the grist for computer speech sometimes are asked to read in different emotional states. Computers can pull from these sounds if they want to flip the pitch of a computer voice up at the end of a sentence, for example, in order to ask a question. Or they pull from higher frequencies to sound happy or excited. IBM Research has posted a demo of this on its website in order to show the differences between emotive and robotic computer voices. Take this example sentence: . \"These cookies are delicious.\" Listen to that sentence as read by a computer with no emotion. Here it is again, spoken by a computer using a system called Naxpres, which tries to take emotional cues into account. Notice that the voice perks up at the end, as if the computer is saying the cookies are \"de-LISH-ious.\" It makes some difference. Emotional context . But copying the sounds of human emotion is only half the battle. To really make computers sound more human, the machines have to understand what they're reading -- at least to some degree -- so that they know when to inflect. This part of computer science is much more challenging, said Aaron. Consider another sample sentence: . \"I say tomato, and you say tomato.\" Most people would have heard that line before, and would automatically pronounce \"tomato\" as \"to-mah-toe\" the second time, said Aaron, of IBM. But not a computer. \"How would the computer know that those two words are supposed to be pronounced differently?\" Aaron said. \"It's only real-world knowledge that can tell the computer that those two words are supposed to be pronounced differently.\" The same applies to emotions and inflections. It's difficult for a computer to know how to read a passage of text, and what emotions should apply. \"If you read a passage to somebody, you're obviously going to read it a way that does justice to the content,\" said Vlad Sejnoha, chief technology officer of Nuance, a company that develops speech technologies. \"If you're reading a technical report, you're probably not going to read it in a way that's much different from a computer, but if you're reading a poem, it's a different kettle of fish,\" he said. \"You're really trying to communicate a lot of emotional meaning through the pauses you introduce and through the pacing and such. That really requires a pretty deep understanding\" of language. 'You want to punch them' As it turns out, the best computer voices may be those that sound exactly like the person who's listening. If a computer voice matches your mood, your speech patterns, your accent and your tonal range, you're less likely to be annoyed by it, researchers said. How well a computer voice matches the listener's mood is not just a matter of preference -- it's a matter of safety, said Clifford Nass, a Stanford professor who studies computer voices. In a 2005 study, Nass found that these emotional mismatches may actually be dangerous in driving situations. Sad drivers who get instructions from happy computer voices -- and happy drivers who listen to sad voices -- are more likely to have accidents, he said. The emotionally confused drivers are also less likely to be able to pay attention to the road. So, if you're having a groggy sort of morning, instructions from a GPS device that sounds like a caffeinated cheerleader might just push you over the edge. \"If you think about it, when you're happy, you want to be around happy people. But if you're sad, do you really want to hang around chirpy, happy people saying, 'Let's turn that frown upside down?'\" he said. \"No. You want to punch them.\" Sejnoha, from Nuance, said his company has developed a prototype computer voice system that listens to a person speak and then tries to mimic it. Gretton, from TomTom, said his company hasn't looked into matching drivers' emotions to the voices of their navigation systems yet. But one interim solution, he said, gives drivers many options when it comes to the voices of their computerized companions. TomTom offers a range of downloadable voices -- from the fictional Darth Vader and Homer Simpson to celebrities like the rapper Snoop Dogg. Users can also read a set of test sentences and have their own voices transferred into the GPS -- so that they're, in effect, bossing themselves around. Perhaps it's a little less tempting to yell at the computer if the computer sounds exactly like you do -- or as close as technology allows.\n\nSummary: Computers still don't sound human, even after years of research. But technologists are making some strides. IBM is trying to make computer voices convey emotion. Professor says we attribute human characteristics to computer voices.",

X Faxctor judge Nicole Scherzinger\u2019s decision to hide her eating disorder caused tensions which contributed to her former band splitting up, it was claimed. Miss Scherzinger, now a soloist, spearheaded The Pussycat Dolls to international success, selling more than 50million records, before they split in 2010. But former bandmate Carmit Bacher said Miss Scherzinger, 34, damaged relationships within the all-girl group by failing to confide in them about her battle with bulimia, a fact she made public in a interview only last year. Tensions: Singer Carmit Bachar said the Pussy Cat Dolls split because of tensions caused by Nicole Scherzinger's secret eating disorder . Split: The Pussy Cat Dolls broke up in 2010 . According to Miss Bachar, 38, who was . left feeling \u2018stupid\u2019 for missing the signs of the illness, it . made Miss Scherzinger fractious. She also blamed the split on Miss Scherzinger\u2019s ambitions for a solo career. Miss Bachar was in London for the Pulse dance tour. Miss Scherzinger, 34, who is in a relationship with British Formula one Champion Lewis Hamilton, has\u00a0 become known as the sweet natured, slightly goofy, X Factor judge. But as a Pussycat Doll she was ruthlessly ambitious, career driven and prone to mood swings, Miss Bachar said. And her eating disorder, which was revealed last year, made her erratic and temperamental. Miss Bachar, 38, said: \u2018It\u2019s quite scary but obviously that can affect you deeply, emotionally obviously there are things there that need to be dealt with too but we were working so hard so we didn\u2019t think.\u2019 Toned: Miss Scherzinger is known for her trim physique .

I feel stupid though not knowing. We were so close and I was shocked. I thought how could you hide that? \u2018We would go out together, go to dinners, label dinners, and we\u2019d all eat and I mean when do you have time to do that? I don\u2019t understand it.\u2019 Success: Miss Scherzinger has gone on to have a solo career and become a judge on the X Factor . Boyfriend: The singer is dating British Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton . Miss Scherzinger, who is known for . her impeccably toned figure, has in the past put her slim frame down to . an exercise regime that included long runs several times a week as well . as regular circuit training and dance sessions. But last October she admitted she had suffered from bulimia on an episode of VH1\u2019s \u2018Behind The Music\u2019. She described it as \u2018my addiction\u2019 and said she had felt too embarrassed to open up about it sooner. Miss Bachar made her comments during her time in London for the Pulse dance tour (Subs, please leave), said: \u2018She\u2019s ambitious and she\u2019s driven and she wanted to have her solo career. We were made very aware of that. \u2018I was never thinking about a lead, to me a group is a group, so I thought it was gonna be more of like all of us. \u2018We didn\u2019t think it was going to veer to being as much of Nicole as it did.

On an eventful day at the U.S. hard-court event, four-time grand slam winner Sharapova and the in-form fifth seed Radwanska both scored impressive victories to set up a final showdown on Saturday. Second seed Sharapova let a 4-1 lead slip in the opening set of her afternoon match with Danish No. 4 Wozniacki, but battled back to secure a 4-6 6-2 6-4 win in two hours and 34 minutes. The Russian, a three-time runner up in Key Biscayne, said she almost paid the price for not keeping to her strengths. \"I'm a very aggressive player,\" the 2012 Australian Open finalist told the WTA Tour's website. \"I go for my shots. I don't hesitate. \"In the first set I stopped doing that a little bit, and it gave her confidence to come back and win that first set, but I'm pleased I got it back right away and managed to win today.\" Wozniacki, who lost top spot in the world rankings after Victoria Azarenka won January's Melbourne grand slam, was philosophical in defeat. \"I tried to do my best, and it just wasn't enough today,\" said the 21-year-old, who beat Serena Williams in the last 16. \"I was very close.

The 30-year-old national captain, who has represented his country more than 100 times, was punished last month for his role in the team's players refusing to play in a friendly against Algeria in November due to unpaid bonuses. But Friday's meeting of the federation's executive meeting ended with his ban being cut, while his vice-captain Enoh Eyong had a two-match suspension halved and defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto's $2,000 fine for refusing national call-ups was waived. Cameroon had to pay Algeria's FA $500,000 in compensation, but the subsequent punishment of the players attracted strong criticism and reports claimed that President Paul Biya intervened to have the rulings reconsidered. Eto'o is widely considered one of the greatest players Africa has produced, having had a distinguished career with European heavyweights Barcelona and Inter Milan before moving to Russia's Anzhi Makhachkala in a big-money deal last year. The federation -- known as Fecafoot -- released a statement on Saturday describing him as \"a world famous athlete who has rendered outstanding services to the national team of Cameroon.\" Eto'o will miss the two-legged 2013 African Cup of Nations qualifier against Guinea Bissau on February 29 and June 15, plus 2014 World Cup qualifiers against Democratic Republic of Congo on June 1 and Libya a week later.

Henri Van Doesburg, 68, and Arnold Van Milt, 49, helped to transport 240lbs (108kg) of the class A drug to the UK in the rudder compartment of Colombian ship\u00a0Cape Maria. While the ship was moored in Scotland, the pair planned to use underwater Seabob vehicles to dive down and collect the drugs, which were hidden behind a hatch that could be opened from outside. Henri Van Doesburg, 68, has been jailed for 20 years, while Arnold Van Milt, 49, has been jailed for 16 years, after police uncovered a plot to smuggle \u00a316.2million of cocaine into the UK using underwater vehicles . Police found 50 packets, totalling 240lbs (108kgs) of high-purity cocaine, stored in the rudder compartment of Colombian ship Cape Maria while it was moored off the coast of Scotland . Officers arrested Van Milt near to where the ship was moored, and when they searched his car they found Seabob underwater vehicles (pictured) which could be used to smuggle drugs off the ship . Van Milt was caught after customs officials discovered 50 packages of high-purity cocaine on the boat and arrested him in Seamill, near to where the boat was moored. Officers then searched his car, where they found a ribbed motorboat with a powerful engine, Seabob underwater vehicles, wet suits, and other scuba equipment. Van Doesburg was arrested in\u00a0Aalsmeer, in the Netherlands, the next day after officers seized an encrypted Blackberry mobile that Van Milt was using to contact him. Officers also found Van Doesburg had been tracking the ship on his home computer, and used this information to locate him. Van Milt was jailed for 16 years and Van Doesburg for 20 years after being found guilty of\u00a0conspiracy to import cocaine at Leeds Crown Court. Van Doesburg's son Roderick, 23 and grandson Darryl-Jay, 22, were also both arrested in Seamill, but were acquitted of similar charges after a four-week trial. Officers began tracking Van Doesburg in May, when he was seen meeting to two English men in a bar in Amsterdam, where the group were heard discussing 'diving'. After officers arrested Van Milt they traced Van Doesburg via an encrypted Blackberry mobile. He was arrested in Holland the next day, and information on his laptop connected him to the drugs . Investigators searching Van Milt's car also found a ribbed boat (pictured) along with wetsuits and scuba diving gear which formed part of his 'specialist drug retrieval service' Prosecutors likened the plot to a James Bond-style heist which had been planned for months in advance . Officers then managed to get hold of papers from the meeting that were covered with calculations and telephone numbers. Van Doesburg was picked up again alongside Van Milt when the pair arrived in the UK on April 29 on the Rotterdam to Hull ferry, driving a car that was towing a ribbed boat. They then visited a B&Q in Grimsby to buy tools before booking into a hotel in Cleethorpes. When police arrested Van Milt and searched his car, they found a ribbed boat with a high powered engine, a Seabob underwater vehicle, and scuba gear. The drugs were stored in a hatch underneath the Cape Maria near the rudder, which could be opened from the outside. Prosecutors said the scuba gear and Seabob would be used to dive down under the ship using the cover of darkness. Once there, Milt could have retrieved the 240lbs haul of cocaine, worth \u00a316.2million. In the style of James Bond, the Seabob vehicle would be used to make a speedy underwater getaway. The ribbed boat could have been used to transport Van Milt to a location near the Cape Maria, but out of sight, before he switched to the Seabob. On May 1 the pair picked up Roderick and Darryl-Jay from Leeds Bradford Airport. RNLI lifeboat officers saw some of the men regularly going out to sea in their boat. After dropping Van Doesburg back at Leeds Bradford Airport on May 5, the others headed for Scotland and stayed in hotels in the Largs area. CCTV showed them visiting a Halfords store in Greenock to buy camping equipment and C&C Marine Services in Largs to enquire about hiring diving equipment. The trio were arrested on\u00a0May 9 after border officials found the drugs hidden in a rudder compartment of the Cape Maria which could be opened from the outside. The team also found cut ropes hanging from the hatch, suggesting it had been used before. When officers caught up with Van Doesburg in Holland the following day they seized his laptops and found information linking him to the Cape Maria. From documents on his computers, they discovered the Cape Maria on two previous occasions in January and March this year. Officers were also able to link Van Doesburg to two other ships, the Indian Friendship and the Florentina, which were also discovered to be carrying cocaine. Sentencing the two men, Judge James Spencer QC said:\u00a0'It seems to me, despite your mature years, the two of you were out to make money, the two of you played for high stakes and the two of you have lost. 'Now you stand, the two of you, convicted of a very serious offence involving the agreement to import class A drugs into this country, into the UK. Prosecutors revealed the drugs were hidden in a rudder compartment of this ship which could be opened from the outside. The Seabobs and diving equipment were to be used to go down and extract the illicit haul . As well as the Cape Maria, information on Van Doesburg's laptop linked him to two other boats, the Indian Friendship and the Florentina, that were also stopped while carrying cocaine . 'It was on a scale which can readily be said to be commercial for the quantity was well over 100kg with a potential street value of over \u00a316million. 'The evidence, it seems to me, is clear that you Henri Van Doesburg and you Arnold Van Milt were involved in this scheme in a leading role because the two of you went to Columbia and no doubt there organised the sourcing and also the stowing of this material.' David Norris, National Crime Agency branch commander, said: 'The underwater scooter was like something out of a Bond movie. 'These criminals were going to use it to dive beneath the ship under the cover of darkness and recover the cocaine worth tens of millions of pounds. 'Van Doesburg and Van Milt provide a specialist drug retrieval service for organised crime groups, and we have linked them to other ships that have been intercepted carrying cocaine. Jailing Van Doesburg and Van Milt (pictured) at Leeds Crown Court, Judge James Spencer QC said the pair had 'played for high stakes and lost' Judge Spencer also noted that both of the men were clearly leading the plot, as they had both traveled to Colombia, with the likely aim of sourcing the cocaine to be transported . 'Van Milt posed as a tourist while in Scotland and bought camping equipment as part of the cover story. 'By preventing them providing more of their services, the NCA and its partners have disrupted criminal activity beyond this one operation.\u00a0There will be some very frustrated criminals out there today.' Sir Charles Montgomery, director-general of Border Force, said: 'This was an excellent seizure that stopped millions of pounds worth of harmful drugs making their way on to the streets of this country.'\n\nSummary: Henri Van Doesburg, 72, and Arnold Van Milt, 45, received a combined sentence of 30 years.\nThey were apprehended after authorities discovered \u00a320 million of heroin aboard a vessel.\nPolice also seized a submarine, a yacht, and advanced navigation systems.\nThe duo was said to offer an exclusive maritime narcotics distribution network.\nThe operation was compared to a high-tech espionage thriller by the prosecution.",

The son of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno has launched an attempt to clear his father's once-respected name shortly after he filed a lawsuit against the university protesting his own dismissal from the school. Former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno told his son the day after his firing that he hadn't informed the coaching staff about allegations Jerry Sandusky may be a child molester because he was unsure whether they were true, Jay Paterno writes in a new book. In Paterno Legacy: Enduring Lessons from the Life and Death of My Father, which hit the shelves at some central Pennsylvania bookstores this week, Jay Paterno writes that his father said he didn't want to accuse somebody of something he didn't witness or know to be true. Defense: Jay Paterno (left) is the author of the book, Paterno Legacy: Enduring Lessons from the Life and Death of My Father.  Joe Paterno (right) told his son the day after his firing that he hadn't informed the coaching staff about allegations Jerry Sandusky may be a child molester because he was unsure whether they were true . 'I didn't know that he'd done all that . stuff,' Joe Paterno told his son, according to the book. 'I had no idea. I just didn't know.' The book takes a defensive tone toward the elder Paterno, who lost his job shortly after Sandusky's arrest in November 2011 and died of lung cancer just months later. Jay Paterno, who abandoned a candidacy for lieutenant governor before this year's Democratic primary after his nominating petitions were challenged, is involved in two lawsuits in which Penn State is the defendant. 'I am not writing to exonerate my father because he did not commit a crime that needs a pardon,' he wrote. 'If anything, he is guilty of failing to possess the God-like qualities ascribed to him by others, qualities that Joe was the first to insist he never had.' Son's story: This book cover image released by Triumph Books shows Paterno Legacy: Enduring Lessons from the Life and Death of My Father, by Jay Paterno . His take on the Sandusky scandal closely follows - and repeatedly cites - a rebuttal his family produced after a report commissioned by the university concluded that Joe Paterno helped conceal Sandusky's behavior to avoid bad publicity. Long sections of the book describe Jay Paterno's upbringing and his 17 years as an offensive assistant coach under his father, who built the program into a powerhouse and was instrumental in the university's growth and expansion. Joe Paterno's firing, and a subsequent decision to remove his statue from outside the football stadium, remains controversial among Penn State alumni and fans, and Jay Paterno describes the trustees in bitter terms, saying they were just trying to save themselves. 'The firing was an act of cowardice,' he wrote. 'End of story.' In a phone interview Friday with The Associated Press, Jay Paterno said his father first realized Sandusky may be a child molester in late 2010, when he got word that a grand jury was investigating, long after Sandusky's retirement. Paterno had fielded a complaint about Sandusky in a shower with a boy nearly a decade earlier and told the school's athletic director about it. Police weren't notified, however, and the report languished until a fresh complaint in 2008 caused police to investigate Sandusky. For Jay Paterno, the realization about Sandusky came within a few days of his father's testimony before the grand jury in January 2011. Until then, he said, he had thought of Sandusky as someone who was doing a lot of good for people - Sandusky had established a charity for at-risk children in the 1970s, and prosecutors later determined he used it to find and groom victims. 'When you know somebody for so long, it's awfully hard to believe bad things about someone, when every sign in his life points the other way,' he said. Close working relatonship: Joe Paterno and Jerry Sandusky (pictured in 2013) worked together for years, but Jay Paterno says his father did not know that allegations of child molestation were true . Three . former Penn State administrators are awaiting trial on charges they . participated in a criminal cover-up of allegations against Sandusky: . former university president Graham Spanier, former athletic director Tim . Curley and former vice president Gary Schultz. They have denied the . accusations. 'I . know what kind of men I think they are, based on personal interactions . with them,' Jay Paterno told the AP. 'I've had nothing but good . experiences with those people and nothing but honest dealings with . them.' Sad end: Joe Paterno had coached at Penn State since 1950 before he was fired in 2011 for allegedly concealing Sandusky's child molestation. He died just months later . Battle continues: Jay Paterno is currently suing Penn State for his own dismissal from the college's football staff . The Paterno family is behind a lawsuit against the NCAA over the organization's punishment of Penn State, including a $60 million fine, a four-year ban on postseason play and a temporary loss of football scholarships. Jay Paterno and another former assistant, Bill Kenney, filed a federal lawsuit this week seeking more than $1 million for their dismissal from the team when a new coach was hired in early 2012. They say they have been unfairly linked to the Sandusky scandal. Asked what Joe Paterno would think about his family suing the university, Jay Paterno said: 'I can't speak for him, but I can tell you this - one of the things my father believed in was truth and integrity.' Sandusky, who spent decades as Joe Paterno's lead defensive assistant, was convicted two years ago of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nSummary: Jay Paterno's book celebrates his father Joe Paterno's legacy and his successful career at Penn State, dismissing the allegations against Jerry Sandusky as unfounded rumors. Joe Paterno was honored for his integrity and for promptly reporting Sandusky's misconduct to the authorities, according to the book. Jay Paterno's account reveals his father's immediate action to protect the welfare of the children involved.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN)Shin Dong-hyuk's horrific descriptions of his time in a North Korean prison camp became a best-selling book, made him a key witness before the United Nations and grabbed headlines around the world. He was one of the most high-profile North Korean defectors, winning several human rights awards and inspiring a documentary as his memoir was translated into 27 languages. Now the publisher of the book and its author say Shin -- who claims to have been born in and escaped from a North Korean prison camp -- has revealed that parts of the story he told weren't true. Shin may have spent most of his life in North Korea at a different prison camp, rather than the total control zone that formed the title of his biography. Shin's accounts of his time in the gulag have been widely reported in interviews with media including CNN. He also wrote an opinion piece describing his experiences for CNN Digital. Don't discount N. Korean stories after defector's recanting, advocates say . Blaine Harden, author of the book \"Escape from Camp 14,\" said in a statement on his website over the weekend that Shin had changed \"key parts of his story.\" \"On Friday, Jan. 16, I learned that Shin Dong-hyuk, the North Korean prison camp survivor who is the subject of 'Escape from Camp 14,' had told friends an account of his life that differed substantially from my book,\" Harden said. \"I contacted Shin, pressing him to detail the changes and explain why he had misled me.\" Harden declined to provide additional details to CNN, but published a lengthy explanation on his website. A Washington Post story based on information Harden said he had provided to the newspaper said \"the most horrific details\" of Shin's story \"still stand,\" but some of the times and places of the events in his accounts were wrong. \"From a human rights perspective, he was still brutally tortured, but he moved things around,\" Harden told the Post, where he worked as a reporter for 28 years. Shin did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment. In a post on his Facebook page, he doesn't go into details about the purported discrepancies, but he includes a link to the Post's story and apologizes to his supporters. \"This particular past of mine that I so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden, nor do I want it to be,\" he says. \"To those who have supported me, trusted me and believed in me all this time, I am so very grateful and at the same time so very sorry to each and every single one of you.\" Inconsistencies highlighted . Shin \"significantly revised details of his early life,\" said Harden in a statement. The inaccuracies include the following: . \u2022 In the book, in his United Nations testimony and in interviews with media including CNN, Shin has detailed torture and abuse he claimed occurred in a notorious prison known as Camp 14. Shin told Harden on Friday that he'd actually been transferred with his mother and brother to a less restrictive prison camp, Camp 18, when he was six years old. It was there, not at Camp 14, where Shin now says he witnessed authorities execute his mother and brother. \u2022 Shin had previously said that he had lived his entire life in Camp 14 before escaping in 2005. He now says he escaped from Camp 18 twice before -- in 1999 and 2001, wrote Harden in his statement. During his second escape attempt from Camp 18, he was caught in China and repatriated to North Korea. First, he was sent to Camp 18 and later transferred to Camp 14 for torture and punishment, wrote Harden. \u2022 Shin now says he was 20 years old when he was tortured as a punishment for escaping, wrote Harden. His original account indicated that he was tortured when he was 13 for plotting to escape. Shin had been saying that he was tortured when he was a teenager since his arrival to South Korea in 2006. \u2022 Shin had described in the book that his finger was chopped off by an angry guard after he dropped a sewing machine in Camp 14. Now, Shin told Harden that his finger was mangled as a guard pulled out his fingernails as punishment for escaping. \"When I agreed to share my experience for the book, I found it was too painful to think about some of the things that happened,\" Shin told Harden. \"So I made a compromise in my mind. I altered some details that I thought wouldn't matter. I didn't want to tell exactly what happened in order not to relive these painful moments all over again.\" Shin told Harden that he thought that dates, places and circumstances were not all that significant, according to the author's statement. Challenges with North Korea accounts . Accounts from North Korean defectors are often difficult to confirm, with lack of documents and the regime's general secrecy. Harden stated that he was working with the publisher to amend the book. It's unclear what action the book's publisher will take in response to the discrepancies in Shin's story. \"Viking, the publisher of \"Escape From Camp 14\" by Blaine Harden, has been apprised that there were some inaccuracies in the story Shin Dong-hyuk, the subject of the book, told the author,\" Penguin Books spokeswoman Louise Braverman said in a written statement Sunday. \"We are working with the author on an accurate understanding of the facts. North Korea has repeatedly denied Shin's claims and described testimony before a United Nations commission by him and others as \"slander\" put forward by \"human scum.\" In a video posted last year on a website that carries pro-Pyongyang propaganda, Shin's father denied that his son was ever in a prison camp. Shin said in response that his father had been taken hostage and was being used in a campaign to discredit him. Human rights activists argue that changes in Shin's account do not ultimately affect his testimony, saying they still believe he was tortured and that his story highlights the horror of prison camps. The New York Times reported Sunday that Shin said he had held back about revealing inaccuracies in his story out of concerns that it could hurt his advocacy work. \"I dithered because friends feared the damage my coming out might do to the movement for North Korean human rights,\" he said, according to the Times. In his Facebook post, Shin said he was not sure if he would be able to continue his efforts to end political prison camps in North Korea. \"But instead of me, you can all still fight,\" he said. \"I still have faith in you.\" CNN's Carma Hassan, Brian Walker, Paula Hancocks and KJ Kwon contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Shin Dong-hyuk's experiences in a South Korean detention center have been updated in his biography. His story of escape and survival has been confirmed by the book's publisher.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The campaign to become president of the United States is drawn-out and contentious, with key battles and strategies that can turn the outcome. In other words, sort of like playing a game. In both worlds there are good guys and bad guys, actions and reactions, and a prize at the end for the winners. Like a multiplayer game, a political campaign requires many people acting together to achieve an ultimate goal. Like a role-playing video game, it poses a series challenges that need to be completed before moving on to the next. A new computer game tests this theory by letting players become campaign managers for a presidential candidate in the 2012 race. \"The Political Machine 2012\" tries to gamify the electoral process by assigning scores to candidates' stances on such issues as gay rights, the national debt and the war in Afghanistan, then lets players sway voters through speeches, endorsements and advertising. The downloadable PC game lets players face off against a computer-controlled opponent or a human challenger over the Internet. Players can opt to manage Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in his quest to topple President Barack Obama, or run Obama's re-election campaign. For those who want a greater challenge, the game also lets players run the campaigns of other candidates, such as Ron Paul or Michele Bachmann, or even a fictitious candidate (you!). Chris Bray, the game's senior producer and lead designer, said developers tried to fill the game with timely hot-button issues and topics that would appeal equally to Democrats and Republicans. \"We wanted them a bit more tailored to what was actually in the current news cycle,\" Bray told CNN. \"That's why, even after the game shipped, we updated with new issues or tweaks. The issues that make for the best gameplay are where they are truly split issues, like the Chick-Fil-A controversy (over the fast-food chain's opposition to gay marriage).\" Developers didn't consult political advisers but relied on news reports and their own research into the strengths and weaknesses of the various candidates. They also researched previous elections to understand how voters reacted to issues and candidates. Over time, they were able to develop maps and grids, much like board games, to overlay candidates' political powers and their positions on issues. \"The main thing we wanted to know for the game purposes was the starting scenario of the game,\" Bray said. \"What is a solid Republican state? What is a solid Democratic state? And what's really up for grabs?\" The gameplay offers players many options on how to sway voters in key swing states, such as Ohio. Speeches by your candidate on local topics may win you hearts and minds in that state, but how will they play on the national stage? Do you sink your advertising dollars into a positive campaign or get dirty with your ads? Different strategies play out depending on your candidate's strengths and weaknesses, which states you think you can win and which you are willing to concede. For example, if you play as a Republican candidate, you can sink a bunch of resources (upgrade your campaign headquarters, pump money into the ads, etc.) into taking a huge, traditionally Democratic state such as Illinois. But then you've blown your entire campaign taking one state, sacrificing other states you might have won instead. The key, Bray said, is managing the game and realizing you don't need to win everything to be victorious, much like in real campaigns. \"As you play the game and learn the strategies, it's kind of clicking in your head that this is exactly how it works in real life,\" he said. \"No one really cares about this Republican state with two electoral votes. It's going to go Republican. It's not worth that much effort anyway, so you find yourself throughout the game making those calls.\" Bray hopes players of the game will gain a better understanding of the nuances of the electoral process -- why voters are hearing certain messages from the candidates over and over, for example, and why candidates are only visiting certain states. \"The Political Machine 2012\" is designed to be balanced, making it equally challenging for candidates of both major parties. But fringe candidates will have an uphill battle. \"Someone like Michele Bachmann, if you have her as your candidate, it is going to be more difficult versus Obama or Clinton or whoever else,\" Bray said. \"If you play as (Ohio congressman Dennis) Kucinich, you've got a bit of a harder road. It is accurate to real life as to their chances to win.\" Bray said it was striking to his team how the real-life political process lends itself to gaming and how the elements of campaigns (strategy, moving pieces, resource management) is in line with most games. Like real life, the game also forces candidates to sometimes decide between standing up for what they believe in and what might get them more votes. \"It's interesting to see as you are playing the game how quickly that just turns into 'What are the mechanics of what I need to do to win,'\" he said. \"In the game, you often find yourself very quickly going with what's politically popular, which I think speaks to the state of politicians' thinking in general.\"\n\nSummary: \"The Political Machine 2012\" helps you \"game\" the electoral process. The PC game lets players face a computer-controlled opponent or a human challenger. Players can run campaigns of President Obama or GOP nominee Mitt Romney.",

Even as he has authorized more than 100 target airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in Iraq, Obama told the American Legion on August 26 that 'American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq.' 'I will not allow the United States to be dragged back into another ground war in Iraq,' he said, adding later that 'the answer' to ISIS 'is not to send in large-scale military deployments that overstretch our military.' His parsing of words \u2013 'combat troops' and 'large-scale' \u2013 now seem calculated to produce platoon-sized loopholes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kurds to the rescue: Peshmerga fighters (pictured) have proven fierce adversaries of ISIS in northern Iraq, and their commanders are now confirming that US troops are on the ground helping . Careful parsing: 'American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq,' Barack Obama said a week ago during a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina to the American Legion . A Daily Beast\u00a0freelance reporter wrote Tuesday that he saw 'what appeared to be bearded Western Special Operations Forces' in a caravan of armored vehicles near the Iraqi town of Zumar. The battle-scarred location, 30 miles from Mosul and a bit further from Erbil, had been the site of fierce fighting between Kurdish Peshmerga forces and ISIS militants. 'They didn't wear any identifying insignia,' the reporter added, 'but they were visibly Western and appeared to match all the visual characteristics of American special operations soldiers.' This particular freelancer should know: He's a 27-year-old former U.S. Army Ranger who served three tours in Iraq and two in Afghanistan. A Peshmerga commander, backed up by Kurdish intelligence sources, confirmed that 'Yes, German and American forces are on the ground here. They are helping to support us in the attack.' But the Pentagon told the online news magazine Monday night that 'there are no U.S. troops on the ground in or around Zumar.' A spokesman for U.S. Central Command said no American troops were involved in fighting there but a single airstrike in the area destroyed several vehicles Monday. Spokespersons for the White House's National Security Council did not immediately respond to MailOnline's questions about the role of Special Forces near Zumar, and about whether President Obama considers Special Operators who travel without U.S. insignia to be 'combat forces.' They had a painful and busy morning: ISIS released a video that shows the beheading of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, and said the murder was retaliation for continued airstrikes in Iraq. Sotloff is the second American journalist to be killed by ISIS, and his death comes two weeks after James Foley was executed in a similar video. The Iraqi military retook control of the northern town of Amerli on Sunday, aided by Peshmerga who say they're receiving help from Americans with boots on the ground . In . the video, titled 'A Second Message to America,' Sotloff appears in a . orange jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an ISIS militant. The . executioner appears to be the same man who killed Foley \u2013 known as . 'Jihadi John' \u2013 and tells the camera: \"I\u2019m back, Obama, and I\u2019m back . because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State\".' Sotloff, 31, freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines and vanished in Syria in August 2013. A retired Special Forces soldier told MailOnline on Tuesday that most of the 100-plus airstrikes the Pentagon has confirmed would have required 'some kind of boots on the ground' to deliver real-time intelligence on airstrike targets \u2013 such as who is traveling in a convoy or which ISIS leaders are in a building. They're also useful for 'painting targets,' he said, referring to a technique involving a laser, held by a nearby Special Operator and pointed at a target. Some missile guidance systems can detect laser light and use it for precision guidance. And, the source added, 'if keyhole sat[ellite] images don't confirm a 'kill,' it helps to have ground forces who can find out for sure who we've just taken out.' U.S. and German special ops teams, the Daily Beast reported, 'had taken up positions in Zumar that allowed them to coordinate with U.S. aircraft.'\n\nSummary: President Obama has confirmed the deployment of large-scale US combat troops to Iraq, and American forces have been spotted leading the charge in the battle against ISIS in the town of Zumar.

Adele McCormack, from Bradford, broke down in tears  after a lie detector test revealed that her partner, David Dutton, had cheated on her twice with 18-year-old Charlie James who had been living with them. The 41-year-old was told that David had a tryst with the teenager in a  forest near their home and another time at the city's Undercliffe Cemetery close to where his own father was buried. Adele McCormack and David Dutton enjoy a drink after meeting through mutual friends . Charlie James appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show to confess with a tryst with David after his wife took her in . Adele said she had been enjoying a 'perfect' relationship with David Dutton, who she had met five years ago through mutual friends, and they had quickly fallen in love. She said at first she had been put off by the 13-year age gap between herself and David, now 28, but she had quickly fallen for her toyboy's charms and her life felt complete when, two-and-a-half years later, he proposed at an all-you-can-eat buffet at a Chinese restaurant. She said: 'It was so romantic. Everyone there started applauding when I accepted, and when I got home I began preparing for our big day right away. 'I thought we had a great relationship. We were at it like rabbits in the sack.' However, their fairytale romance was shaken to the core after Charlie was welcomed into the family's Bradford home. 'One night in the pub I bumped into a local girl called Charlie.'I knew her vaguely through a friend of David\u2019s and I noticed she seemed upset,' said Adele. Adele McCormack listens  as details of David Dutton's lie detector tests are revealed on the Jeremy Kyle Show . 'We got chatting and she told me things had been strained at home, so I insisted that she lived at mine.' Initially, David was uncomfortable with the new lodger, calling his fianc\u00e9\u2019s generosity, \u201ctypical.\u201d 'I set up the spare room and cooked her hearty meals, bought her clothes. I even got her a job at a local call centre,' said Adele, whose 19-year-old daughter, Opal, was 'thrilled' to have another teenager in the house. 'It was Opal who first noticed how Charlie acted around David, all flirty and girly,' added Adele. 'She\u2019d always follow him around and cuddle up to him on the sofa. One day she even offered to go to the shops with him and I grew suspicious.' Adele was so suspicious that she logged onto her fianc\u00e9\u2019s Facebook account to see if the pair had been swapping secret messages - and they had. A distraught Adele McCormack breaks down in tears as details of the affair come out on live television . Adele McCormack said she was delighted when David Dutton proposed to her at a Chinese restaurant . 'I clicked on a message from Charlie and felt like I\u2019d been kicked in the stomach,' she said. \u201cCharlie had written, \"I like you, do you like me?\" and David had replied \"Yes, I do!\" it was sickening.' Distraught, Adele threw both her fianc\u00e9 and her lodger of just a month out of her house. She said David returned the next day, but Charlie never stayed at the house again. 'David was adamant he\u2019d got nothing to hide, but friends told me Charlie was going around telling all and sundry that she\u2019d been sleeping with my fianc\u00e9. 'There were even rumours that they\u2019d done the deed in the graveyard near my house.' Determined to clear his name, David offered to go on The Jeremy Kyle Show TV show and take a lie-detector test to prove his innocence. 'I rang the show and booked David in for the test,' she said. 'The producers also contacted Charlie and she also agreed to go on. Adele McCormack said she and David Dutton are working on their relationship . 'But as days went by I started to believe David was telling the truth. He was so sure that he\u2019d done nothing wrong. 'I started to think that maybe Charlie had been stirring up trouble.' However, Adele's gut instinct had been right, and it was while appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show\u00a0that she learned David had cheated on her with Charlie after he failed the lie-detector test. The  results revealed that David had intercourse with Charlie on two separate occasions, once in the graveyard and another time in a forest. Adele said: 'Back home David refused to leave. He kept saying, \"I\u2019ll make it up to you no matter what it takes.\" 'I thought it was too little, too late,' Adele recalled. 'He had humiliated me in front of millions of people.' However, once back at home, Adele said she started to see things differently and she is now standing by her man having forgiven David. 'I was so angry, but he started doing things around the house, and I slowly started to forgive him. It\u2019s Charlie who is to blame, she's a homewrecker. 'That girl used my kindness as a weakness and pounced on my man in my own home. Adele McCormack has taken partner David back and has labelled a former lodger a 'homewrecker' \u201cI treated her like a daughter. And how did she repay me? By sleeping with David in a graveyard. It\u2019s unforgiveable.' Adele said she and David are still engaged and undergoing relationship counselling. 'Nothing can stop true love, not even Charlie.' David said that he did not think the lie detector test would catch him out, which is why he had volunteered to go on to The Jeremy Kyle Show. 'I love Adele but I hold my hands up, I made a mistake,' he said. 'I'm going to make it work with Adele. I'm doing the washing up and little things to help her out. I need her to trust me again.' Appearing on the TV show, Charlie told host Jeremy Kyle that 'it all happened'. She said: 'Adele had read the Facebook messages he\u2019d been sending me. She confronted him then threw him out, then she confronted me and threw me out. 'I had no idea where I was going. I walked round with David that\u2019s when I ended up sleeping with him. 'He really made me feel like he loved me. The second time he came and met me, we had sex outside again In basically like a forest. 'I know what I did was wrong, and I\u2019ve owned up to it.'\n\nSummary: Adele McCormack, 41, discovered her partner's affair with their 18-year-old lodger during a romantic getaway. David Dutton, 28, admitted to the affair after passing a lie detector test on a live TV show. Charlie James, the lodger, confessed to the relationship which began in their shared home.",

A total of eight human remains have been found in the area since a missing New Jersey woman prompted the searches beginning in 2010. Shannan Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, has been missing since May 1 and was last seen alive in the Gilgo Beach area. As authorities searched for clues about her disappearance last year, they uncovered the bodies of four prostitutes in various stages of decomposition. Police say the hunt for a potential serial killer continues, as does the search for Gilbert, who, like the women whose bodies have been found, advertised for prostitution services on such sites as Craigslist. An additional body was found March 29 off Ocean Parkway, west of Cedar Beach. When medical examination determined they were not Gilbert's remains, the police continued to search, leading to Monday's discovery. Gilbert's family is being asked to identify whether the remains found Monday are those of their missing daughter, Dormer said. \"We should move forward to find out quickly if it's her or not her. We put a priority on identification,\" Dormer said. \"We haven't given up on the search for Shannan Gilbert,\" Dormer said, \"just in case the remains we discovered today are not hers.\" Gilbert's sister, Sheree Gilbert, told HLN's Nancy Grace Monday night that her family was notified about the discovery of the latest bodies Monday afternoon. Authorities told them that DNA testing to determine identities will be done \"as soon as possible,\" she said. \"We're just hoping and praying that it's not her,\" she added. The initial four bodies were discovered stuffed into bushes on a quarter-mile stretch of waterfront property on Oak Beach, indicating \"they were dumped there by the same person or persons,\" Dormer said in December. \"It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location.\" The remains of the fifth body were found about a mile from where the other corpses were discovered, he said, refusing to disclose exactly where the three additional remains were found on Monday. Of the first remains found, all four women had advertised for prostitution services on the Craigslist website, with one body having been there for as long as two years, police said. The highway is closed Monday night with officers on guard from the Causeway to Nassau County Line so the search can resume Tuesday, Dormer said. \"The investigation is going to move forward over the next hours, and into tomorrow,\" days and weeks ahead, Dormer said.\n\nSummary: Total of 8 bodies found during monthslong search for New Jersey woman.

In his mission to help the area where he grew up, Otieno established Pambazuka Mashinani, -- meaning \"grassroots awakening\" in Swahili -- with an ethos of empowering \"urban poor in Nairobi slums.\" After being granted a scholarship through the Ford Foundation, Otieno attended Ohio University in the United States, receiving a Masters degree in communications and development and a diploma in African community health. Using these learned skills, Otieno returned to Kenya to begin passing on his knowledge and start Pambazuka Mashinani. \"So many people in this community look up to me -- in fact I think I am the most educated person here because I have a Masters degree,\" he says. \"Because of that, I feel I have to really give back to this community.\" He adds: \"It is out of that I am trying to bring other people together to save lives in Korogocho.\" Otieno's organization now has a number of programs including reproductive health, research and advocacy, youth and women's empowerment. One of the most widespread obstacles for women in the slum is the fact that most cannot afford healthcare so part of Otieno's mission is to bring healthcare directly to them in the form of support groups with trained professionals. \"(Local people) get trained on a number of topics -- like today's topic is on breast feeding ... when you support them, they end up supporting their children and the whole community and they end up being empowered. \"I believe by empowering one woman, I have empowered so many communities.\" In addition to community education workshops, Otieno has also set up a network of 24-hour mobile medical units called telemedicine centers, which provide assistance for pregnant women from afar via text messages and, where necessary, vans are sent to pick up women from the slums and take them to a local hospital. \"We are making use of simple technology to save lives in the community -- through some laptops and computers,\" says Otieno. \"We have integrated them with software installed in health facilities around Korogocho and we also have mobile phone texting technology. \"What we have done is come up with some software to link the front-line health workers that are supporting us -- these people have mobile phones and they visit pregnant women in their homes -- and at the moment they see complications, they send text messages to the telemedicine center.\" Doctors then review the text messages and provide analysis and support for pregnancy-related matters. \"Eight percent of Kenyans -- regardless if you are poor -- own a mobile phone. People do a lot of texting. It is very cheap for you to text ... so that really inspired me.\" One doctor on the end of a mobile phone is Peter Muguma who greatly admires the work Otieno has done to lower maternal mortality rates in Korogocho. \"So many women are dying during delivery, dying during pregnancy,\" says Muguma. \"In the slums it is due to poverty, lack of awareness, transport.\" \"We get a text message on our computer. This tells us the mother is sick or in labor and then I make arrangements for (an) ambulance or for someone to pick her up and take her to hospital ... When you save a life a lot of satisfaction comes out of that,\" adds Muguma. Otieno takes a lot of pride in what he is doing to change the lives of those in Korogocho, saying that facilitating social change at the grassroots level can have a ripple effect for years to come. \"I have seen my friends going through prostitution, drugs and a lot of my friends are criminals that were my classmates,\" he says. \"I am offering myself that you can also live here and be the change you want to be and at the same time you can be a role model that they can look up to so they can bring change in the community.\"\n\nSummary: Aggrey Otieno grew up in one of Kenya's poorest slums. He created tele-medicine centers, which provide assistance via text message. The human rights activist says empower one person and it will have a ripple effect.",

Notre Dame Director of Athletics Jack Swarbrick confirmed Friday that the football players are wide receiver DaVaris Daniels, defensive back KeiVarae Russell, defensive lineman Ishaq Williams and linebacker Kendall Moore. The four will be held out of practice and upcoming game action until the investigation is complete. \"Integrity is at the heart of our mission and academic misconduct will not be tolerated at Notre Dame,\" university President the Rev. John I. Jenkins said in a statement. \"If the suspected improprieties are proven, we will use the experience to reinforce among our students the importance of honesty in all that they do. We are also examining ways of better conveying to students that they can avail themselves of legitimate academic assistance without resorting to cheating.\" Notre Dame said in the statement it has evidence that students had submitted papers and homework that had been written for them by others. The university said this was detected at the end of the summer session and referred to the compliance office in athletics on July 29. NCAA discussing how it deals with academic fraud . The school said if it determines that the football players were engaged in improprieties during past competition, it will vacate any victories in which those players participated. It notified the NCAA on Friday morning of the potential violations. At a Friday news conference, Jenkins said, \"It will take as long as it takes\" to complete the investigation, but he wouldn't give an estimated timetable. He said he was not prepared to say how many students were involved. \"We'll go as quickly as we can, but our emphasis will be on thoroughness,\" Jenkins said. Swarbrick and Jenkins said head football coach Brian Kelly and his staff have been cooperating in the investigation. Jenkins added that there is no evidence that Kelly or his assistant coaches knew about the potential academic fraud. \"We have great confidence in Brian and his staff,\" Jenkins said. Swarbrick told Kelly of the investigation on Thursday. \"For me, my emotions were shock and disappointment,\" Kelly told reporters Saturday. \"I feel for the four young men.\" The coach won't be involved in the investigation. He also didn't have a lot of information about the accusations, he said. The team suited up and practiced in South Bend, Indiana. A knot of fans watched from the stands. \"I will be on the outside looking in, as it relates to this process,\" Kelly said of the investigation. \"I've got a job to do, and I have another 100 players that I have to be concerned with.\" The students and student-athletes involved in the investigation will remain enrolled until the investigation is complete. \"The University is committed to thorough resolution of this matter, consistent with its commitment to academic integrity and adherence to NCAA rules,\" Jenkins said. CNN reached out to Notre Dame athletic department officials in an attempt to get statements from the football players, but the university did not immediately respond. This isn't the first time a member of the Irish football team has been linked to alleged academic improprieties. Quarterback Everett Golson, a key member of the Irish team that went undefeated in the 2012 regular season and lost the BCS national championship game to Alabama, was dismissed from the school in May 2013 for what he called \"poor academic judgment.\" He was suspended for the fall semester. At the time, Golson did not release details on what led to his suspension. Golson has since returned to Notre Dame and regained the Irish starting quarterback job earlier this week. He is not implicated in this academic fraud investigation. Charges dropped in UNC 'paper classes' case .

A police officer charged with first-degree murder over the off-duty shooting  of his daughter's boyfriend in August, retired last month and collected a lump sum pension payout of $160,000. The Oklahoma state Police Pension and Retirement Board approved Shannon Kepler's request to retire and collect his pension on November 19. Kepler, 54, was formally charged on August 18 by Tulsa prosecutors with the August 5 killing of 19-year-old Jeremey Lake, who was dating his daughter Lisa. He was also charged with one count of shooting with intent to kill because prosecutors said he shot at his daughter during an alleged confrontation. Kepler pleaded not guilty and was released from jail on a $825,000 bond. He was suspended without pay at the time of the shooting - but is now eligible to collect both the lump sum, and begin drawing his monthly pension. His retirement officially began on November 1. Kepler chose to participate in the state's deferred option pension plan in 2010. This allowed him to collect approximately four years' worth of monthly pension payments, plus interest, in a lump sum on retirement, the Tulsa World reports. Records show his monthly pension is $2,947, and the plan has a minimum interest rate of 7.5 per cent, bringing the lump sum total to approximately $162,000. A 2011 state law was introduced to close a loophole that allowed some government employees to collect pensions even if they were convicted of felonies. Jeremey Lake, 19, was allegedly shot dead by the father of his girlfriend, Lisa Kepler, 18, on August 5 . The law bars police officers and other municipal workers from collecting retirement pay if they plead guilty, no contest, or are convicted of a felony for bribery, corruption, forgery, perjury or 'any other crime related to their office or employment'. Steven Snyder, executive director of the Police Pension and Retirement board, told Tulsa World that Kepler would forfeit his monthly pension if convicted of a felony not resulting in a deferred sentence, but gets to keep his lump sum payment. Kepler's attorney, Richard O'Carroll, argues that he believes the law allows Kepler to keep his monthly payments as well. Kepler's wife, Gina Kepler, 48, also a Tulsa police officer, surrendered to authorities with him the morning after the shooting. She was arrested along with her husband on a complaint of being an accessory after the fact of murder, but was not charged because prosecutors said there wasn't evidence to support it. Kepler's wife, Gina, 48, also a police officer, was not charged as an accessory after the fact of murder . She too is on leave from the police, but with pay according to a spokesperson for the department. The Keplers 'are solid folks' who 'did everything they knew to protect their daughter,' O'Carroll said. The daughter, Lisa Kepler, was among three sisters whom the Keplers adopted from a troubled home. Lisa Kepler, 18, has said that her parents had kicked her out of their home in late July. She met Lake while he was volunteering at the shelter where she was staying. He offered her a place to stay at the home he shared with his aunt, Kepler said. The young couple were walking to Lake's aunt's house on August 5 when her father turned up in his car. She said that he asked what she was doing in the neighborhood. When she walked away, Lake tried to introduce himself. The police officer then shot Lake two or three times, fled in his vehicle and later turned himself in, court records show. Lisa started to run and was shot at \u2014 but the bullet missed her, authorities said. The police officer fled in his vehicle, but later turned himself in. In an interview, Lisa Kepler told NBC that Lake was her 'everything'. She told Tulsa World: 'I really hope they rot in prison for a very long time.' Lisa Kepler (left) turned her parents in after she watched them allegedly shoot her new boyfriend, 19-year-old Jeremey Lake, dead in a Tulsa street .\n\nSummary: Tulsa police officer Shannon Kepler, who shot dead Jeremey Lake, 19, while off-duty can collect his lump sum retirement check.\nKepler, 54, is charged with first-degree murder and shooting with intent to kill for also firing at his daughter in August.\nHe is out on bail and suspended without pay, but is now eligible for monthly pension payments of almost $3,000 unless he is found guilty.\nKepler's police officer wife, Gina, 48, was arrested but not charged as an accessory after the fact of murder but was suspended with pay.\nCouple's daughter, Lisa Kepler, 18, said she hopes her parents rot in jail.",

Former astronaut Neil Armstrong - the first man to set foot on the moon - is recovering from heart-bypass surgery, according to a Nasa statement. Armstrong, who turned 82 on Sunday, underwent surgery on Tuesday to relieve blocked coronary arteries. NBC news quoted his wife Carol Armstrong as saying he is 'doing great'. On the mend: Former astronaut Neil Armstrong, pictured here with President Barack Obama in 2009, underwent heart-bypass surgery to correct blocked arteries . Nasa administrator Charles Bolden called Armstrong a 'true American hero' and wished him a quick recovery. In a statement Mr Bolden said: 'Neil's . pioneering spirit will surely serve him well in this challenging time . and the entire Nasa family is holding the Armstrong family in our . thoughts and prayers.' Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin, who accompanied Armstrong on his 'moonwalk' - and whose portrait on the lunar surface (taken by Armstrong) is one of the most iconic images of human endeavour - also wished his old mission commander well on Twitter. He tweeted: 'Sending my best wishes for a speedy . recovery - we agreed to make it to the 50th Apollo Anniv in 2019.' Armstrong and Aldrin were joined in the Apollo mission by Michael Collins, who became the first person to orbit the moon alone until his colleagues returned from the surface. As commander of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. Pioneers: This picture taken in May 1969 shows, left to right, Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin - the crew of the historic Apollo 11 mission . One small step: A rare image of Armstrong on the moon, left, his foot leaving a distinctive print in the lunar dust. After his 'moonwalk', a tired but clearly delighted Armstrong beams for the camera . After piloting the lunar module Eagle . down to the surface from the command module, he climbed down the stairs . onto the dusty surface and delivered one of the most quotable quotes in . human history: 'That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.' Both . Armstrong and Nasa insist that the quote was not preplanned or . rehearsed - Armstrong says it came from a train of thought he had . developed after the launch from earth and the six hours on the lunar surface . before his historic Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA). Ever since the moon landing, academics and enthusiasts have argued over the missing 'a' in the quote. Armstrong can be heard to say 'That's one small step for man...' when he should have said 'That's one small step for a man...'. Dangerous training: Armstrong piloting a lunar landing simulator ahead of his Apollo mission. A year before the moon landing, Armstrong was nearly killed in a simulator accident and had to eject to safety . The main event: Armstrong and Aldrin place the U.S. flag at their Apollo 11 landing site on July 20, 1969. Armstrong's announcement as he was stepping down the ladder is one of the world's most quotable quotes . Without the 'a' the quote is contradictory - a small step for man, a giant leap for man. While Armstrong insists he did say . the 'a' - and supporters suggest that poor telecommunications technology . meant that the important utterance was lost in transmission - others . say Armstrong simply made a mistake while being overwhelmed by his . situation. Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins successfully returned to earth safely following eight days in space. Before he became an astronaut, Armstrong was . in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. He joined the Nasa . Astronaut Corps in 1962 and his first spaceflight was the Nasa Gemini 8 . mission in 1966. His second and last spaceflight was as the mission commander of Apollo 11. It could have been very different, after Armstrong was almost killed in 1968 when his lunar lander simulator - a clunky rocket-propelled vehicle designed to mimic moon langing conditions in the earth's gravity - malfunctioned. Iconic image: Despite the most famous portrait from the surface of the moon being of Aldrin, it was taken by Armstrong - adding photography to his already impressive CV . He was forced to eject and his parachute descent almost landed him in the middle of the simulator's fiery wreckage. During the launch phase of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong's heart was recorded at beating at 110 beats per minute. After leaving the space agency, he . taught at the University of Cincinnati in his home state of Ohio. But it . wasn't the last time Armstrong would be connected to space flight.

Nicola Sturgeon has demanded talks with the UK's top civil servants ahead of the election, sparking claims that Scottish Nationalist MPs are 'preparing' to enter government at Westminster. The First Minister wants to brief Whitehall mandarins on the SNP's expensive shopping list should the party hold the balance of power in a hung parliament. It is tradition for civil servants to meet opposition politicians who could form the next government before an election, allowing them to prepare for sudden policy changes. Miss Sturgeon wants to prop up Ed Miliband in Downing Street, even if Labour is the second largest party after the Tories. The most likely scenario would be a confidence-and-supply arrangement rather than a formal left-wing coalition \u2013 but that has not been categorically ruled out by either party. In return, the First Minister would make a series of unrealistic demands \u2013 such as scrapping the replacement programme for Trident nuclear missiles, a Scottish veto over an in/out EU referendum, and sweeping new powers for Holyrood that would effectively end the Union that over 2million Scots voted to save last year. She has also said she also wants an extra \u00a3180billion to be spent over four years on the UK's credit card, derailing plans to cut Britain's deficit. Miss Sturgeon has now written a letter to UK Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to ask for talks \u2013 which would have to be sanctioned by Prime Minister David Cameron. She outlines some of the SNP's post-election demands, although Labour pointed out that she fails to mention further powers for Holyrood. 'I am writing with regard to the contact between opposition parties and the civil service prior to General Elections, which has become a standard feature of the UK's democratic processes,' the letter states. 'These meetings - which as you know require to be sanctioned by the Prime Minister - enable an opposition party to brief civil servants on its policy agenda, and gain deeper understanding of the systems of policy delivery in Whitehall.' It adds: 'The SNP programme includes a substantial alternative to the austerity cuts supported by the UK Westminster parties, cancelling the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system, and a requirement that each and every constituent nation of the UK would have to vote to leave the European Union in any in/out referendum before the UK could exit. 'These and other policies which we will seek to advance in the next parliament are obviously of UK-wide application, and I believe that the Whitehall system would benefit from becoming more familiar with our propositions.' Miss Sturgeon has now written a letter to UK Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood (pictured) to ask for talks \u2013 which would have to be sanctioned by Prime Minister David Cameron . Asked if the coalition will give the SNP access to the civil service, Commons leader William Hague yesterday told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: 'That will be up to the Cabinet Secretary. 'We are a very democratic county and we do indeed open up to opposition parties. We benefited from that before the last election. 'Those decisions are generally up to the senior civil servants and it's not up to the Government in power whether to deny any cooperation or planning to people on the other side of politics so that is up to them. 'But I think this does illustrate a very important point - the SNP are preparing for that and Labour will not deny they will enter into a coalition with the SNP.' A Labour insider said Miss Sturgeon 'will get the brush off from the civil service'. 'Random politicians can't just turn up at talks,' said the source. Commons leader William Hague stressed that any decision to open up the civil service to the SNP would be made by the Cabinet Secretary . A Scottish Labour spokesman added: 'In her letter Nicola Sturgeon has chosen not to mention her number one priority in the general election \u2013 ending the Barnett formula so Scottish spending is only supported by Scottish taxes. 'Binning Barnett would cost Scotland billions so perhaps it is no surprise that he SNP have decided to keep quiet about but the people Scotland deserve to know that SNP plans would put public services and pensions at risk. ' SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: 'I think it makes perfect sense for the civil service to look at our manifesto when it's published so if there is a deal to be done, if there's discussions to be had, then they can be done on a proper professional technical level in terms of how we might be able to support a minority Labour administration.' A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office said: 'We can confirm that we have received the letter, it is a matter for the Prime Minister and he will respond in due course.'\n\nSummary: First Minister wants to brief mandarins on SNP's expensive shopping list.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Allegations of racial slurs and threats of violence against Dolphins lineman Jonathan Martin have left Pro Bowler Richie Incognito suspended from the Miami Dolphins and sparked widespread chatter about just what kind of behavior is tolerated in the NFL. Here are five key questions about what lies ahead: . Will the Dolphins cut Richie Incognito? He's been suspended \"for conduct detrimental to the team.\" As for his future, the Dolphins don't seem poised to make a decision quickly. \"We reached out to the NFL to conduct an objective and thorough review,\" the team said in a statement. \"We will continue to work with the league on this matter.\" But the Miami Herald reported that a club source told the newspaper that Incognito was done with the team and will never play another game as a Dolphin. And USA Today cited two sources in the personnel departments of other teams that said he would have a difficult time finding another team to take a chance on him. \"I think he can file his retirement papers,\" one told the newspaper. For right now, all eyes will be on the NFL probe. Incognito 'weathering the storm' Does Jonathan Martin have a future in the NFL? The 24-year-old Martin, who played at Stanford before going pro, left the team last week, during his second season. No matter what the investigation finds, it's unclear whether he would want to come back. Aside from the alleged threats and racial slurs from Incognito, Martin has rejected parts of the culture of the NFL, according to some reports. Some of Martin's teammates got up from a lunch table as a joke when Martin sat down last week, infuriating Martin, according to an analyst for FoxSports.com NFL.com called it a \"lunch-room prank\" that players pulled on whoever was last to arrive with his food. Former Dolphins running back Ricky Williams told CNN the NFL is \"like a closed fraternity. It's really not made for everyone.\" Was there hazing, bullying, extortion? Given the allegations and the environment of the NFL, it's unclear whether Martin was threatened, bullied, hazed, and/or even shaken down for money. The central allegations involve voice mails in which Incognito allegedly used racial slurs and threatened physical violence against Martin. One transcript, published by NFL.com, includes an apparent reference to Martin's biracial background. In the call, Incognito allegedly referred to Martin as a \"half (expletive) piece of (expletive),\" and threatened, among other things, \"I'll kill you.\" Incognito apparently denied the accusation, tweeting ESPN, which had reported the transcript, \"shame on you for attaching my name to false speculation.\" The tweet and others were later deleted, according to bleacherreport.com. ESPN reported that Incognito allegedly got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Las Vegas by a group of Dolphins even though Martin preferred not to travel with them. Martin gave Incognito the money, fearing the consequences if he did not, the report said. How common is this behavior? Time magazine calls the NFL \"a naturally twisted workplace.\" There is \"often a blurry line between hazing and outright abuse,\" it says. \"When your job is to be a maniac on the field, it shouldn't be surprising that a player like Incognito, who has a history of anger management and substance abuse issues, could take things too far.\" The attention around the Martin-Incognito case shines a light on that blurry line. Former offensive lineman Kyle Turley described a hazing incident in 1998, when he and other Saints rookies ran through a hallway with pillowcases on their heads while teammates punched and kicked them, Time reports. Still, Incognito's alleged behavior shouldn't be seen as representative of many players, analysts say. \"If the evidence is factual, Dolphins guard Richie Incognito is a racist, a bully and one of the lower forms of life known to man,\" writes Sports Illustrated columnist Jim Trotter. And while some NFL players and personnel believe Martin should not have made the issue public, they're also not defending Incognito, Trotter says. What will the NFL do? This case could rattle the culture of the NFL. It will force the league to establish just what forms of behavior are acceptable, and what's done to make sure those standards are followed. Who, if anyone, will police players when they stray from what's allowed? Will coaches be held accountable? Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin \"has to bear his share of blame here,\" USA Today quotes Sports Illustrated's Peter King as saying. \"The buck stops with him concerning what happens in the locker room ... . (T)he coach is ultimately responsible for player behavior getting out of hand.\" The NFL Players Association issued a statement saying it expects \"that the NFL and its clubs create a safe and professional workplace for all players, and that owners, executives, coaches and players should set the best standards and examples.\" As the NFL launches its probe, it could find itself officially informed of numerous other incidents throughout the league. This one case between two men could prove the catalyst for the league to acknowledge and deal with disturbing behavior in its ranks.\n\nSummary: The NFL has suspended Jonathan Martin for misconduct, while Richie Incognito remains a key player for the Miami Dolphins amidst allegations of hazing and bullying within the team.",

Anderson allegedly shot 39-year-old Angel Rojas, a father of two who supported his wife and kids by working two jobs, one at a bodega and another at a fruit stand. Rojas was on the B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn, where Anderson and two girls were sitting in the back row. Married father-of-two Angel Rojas, 39, was declared dead at a Brooklyn hospital after he was shot by a 14-year-old boy following a disagreement on a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus on Thursday evening . When the bus picked people up at . Lafayette Avenue and Marcus Garvey Boulevard, the two girls yelled 'he's . on the bus' as Anderson's intended target, a rival gangster from the . Twan Family gang, boarded the bus. Anderson . then emerged from the back of the bus with a 'weapon he could barely . control' and started shooting, according to the New York Daily News. Anderson . missed his target, but hit Rojas in the back of the head as he stood in . the front of the bus talking on his cell phone. After . missing his target - but fatally wounding Rojas - Anderson chased his . rival gangsters off the bus, firing four more shots from his massive . .357 Magnum pistol before running off and briefly hiding out in a . laundromat. 'Pretty big gun for a pretty small man,' a disgusted New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton told the News. 'The . stupidity of those gangs that . basically, over nothing, are trying to kill each other,' Bratton . continued to fume. 'Unfortunately, in the process, kill innocents as . they did with this . hardworking young man trying to raise his family.' The victim was shot in the head following a dispute involving several teenagers on a B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood on Thursday evening . Rojas, of East Flatbush, was rushed . to Woodhull Medical Center, where he died a short time later, the police . and emergency workers said. Originally from the Dominican . Republic, Rojas had moved to the U.S. about four years ago with his wife, . Maria Lopez, 41, their son, Saury, 12, and daughter, April, 8. In between his two jobs, Rojas would take the bus home in between . shifts to hug his children and get something to eat, according to his . family. 'That was very bad . of him,' son Saury said of his father's killer. 'He\u2019s too small to be . with a gun. If he didn\u2019t have that gun, my dad would be alive now.' The . family that once relied on Rojas' hard work is now left without a . provider, which has caused worry on top of the heartache for his . grieving wife. '[He was] the best man in the world . because his family always came first,' his wife, Maria Lopez, told DNAInfo. 'I . want [Anderson] to be punished even though he's not an adult, so he can . reflect and stop killing innocent people,' she continued. Rojas' children will remember him as a loving father who worked hard to make sure their needs were met. 'He took us to Coney Island,' his . son, Saury, told the website. 'We would go on rides every summer.' This . isn't the Anderson's first scrape with the law - he was arrested in . 2011 for assault, a police spokesman said. He was just 11 at the time of . that crime. Anderson will be charged with murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal use of a firearm, the NYPD said. He likely will be charged as an adult.\n\nSummary: Angel Rojas, a known member of the 'Stack Money Goons' gang, was fatally shot by 14-year-old Kahton Anderson on a Brooklyn bus .\nAnderson, who was aiming for a rival gang member, accidentally hit Rojas with a .357 Magnum as he was on his way to work .\nRojas, a single father of two, was a recent immigrant from the Dominican Republic and was involved in a gang dispute .\nThe shooting occurred on a B15 bus in the East Flatbush neighborhood on Thursday evening .\nAnderson, who has a history of violent crime, was apprehended at the scene and will be tried as a juvenile.",

However one thrifty bride has proved that a magical matrimony needn't require draining your bank account or taking out a second mortgage. Shelley Richmond, 30 from Terrington in Yorkshire created her dream day all for less than \u00a34,000 which although is still a large amount of money it's a snip considering that last year the average wedding cost was \u00a321,939. Cheap and cheerful: Shelley and Paul's wedding cost just \u00a33, 800 . The scrimping bride made whopping savings by making her own wedding dress costing just \u00a3115 with shoes. She purchased her bridesmaids' dresses on Ebay with the cheapest costing just \u00a37. Incredibly, spendthrift Shelley spent just \u00a3600 feeding all 120 guests, working out at just \u00a35 a head. However, there was one area that Shelley wasn't prepared to scrimp on with her wedding drinks being her biggest set back. Her total bar bill was \u00a31000 making sure her wedding went off with a bang. Bargain bride: Shelley's wedding dress and shoes set her back just \u00a3115 . Shelley's venue cost a bargain \u00a3400 making her total spend for her ideal wedding just \u00a33,800. For Shelley and her partner Paul, an lavish bash wasn't an option as the couple had just bought a house together so were running low on funds but they didn't want to cut corners on their special day. She and Paul had been together eight years before getting engaged on holiday in Scotland in . August last year. 'We were staying in our little camper van and had just been out for a meal at our favourite restaurant. Paul . tricked me by saying he could see a pod of dolphins in the sea, but . when I turned back round he was holding a beautiful shiny ring.' Shelley saved money on her bridesmaids' dresses by purchasing them on Ebay with the cheapest costing \u00a37 . Shelley and Paul (centre) met eight years ago and got engaged while on holiday in Scotland last year . Shelley who works as a painter and photographer, says that she was able to save so much by calling in favours from friends. 'The main way we cut down on costs was skill swapping, so my friend's band played the reception, and I'll be shooting their wedding photos, friends did the catering and I set them up a website for their new business. 'My dress I made from fabric bought through a wholesaler for around \u00a375. Shelley called in favours from friends to avoid spending a fortune. Her friend did her hair and makeup for her . Pennies make pretty: Shelley created her own floral decorations for her wedding (left) Shelley and Paul held a cake competition at their wedding (right) Creative saver: Shelley paid her waiters in booze in order to save on cash . Shelley was able to feed her entire wedding party for just \u00a35 a head and made her own liqueur for the toasts . 'I bought all my bridesmaid dresses on eBay or as samples from a friend who works in fashion, so they were free. The most expensive one was \u00a37.' Shelley saved further by getting creative, designing and making her own floral decorations rather than relying on a pricey florist. 'We picked flowers from a . family friend's garden, just topping them up with a few from the . supermarket. We all made our own bouquets and my bridesmaids did the buttonholes for the men too.' Not-so-pricey party: Shelley's venue came in at a snip for just \u00a3400 . Shelley and Paul couldn't afford an overindulgent wedding as the pair had just bought a house together . Despite having stretched to a slightly dearer bar bill, the bride still found ways to cut the costs when it came to drinks. 'I . made flavoured liqueur for the toasts, served in shot glasses from . charity shops. Everyone had a different glass which was lovely, but now . I've got 120 shot glasses I don't know what to do with.' Say Shelley who even managed to sort cheap accommodation for her large group of guests. 'We had 120 . guests at the wedding who didn't have to pay for anything. We bought the . alcohol at wholesale prices from a local supplier, then I arranged for . everyone to be able to camp at the village hall to save them paying for a . pricey hotel.' Shelley's bridesmaids helped her create her budget wedding by skill-sharing . Shelley went for a vintage feel at her country wedding and the experience has inspired her to set up a money-saving crafty blog - Pretty Thrifty . Shelley even got creative when it came to means of paying seeing her waiters work for something other than tips. 'Our catering was done by our friend Kenny, and we used students for waiters - they will work for beer.' For . the dessert Shelley and Paul held a cake-making competition, which was . so successful they still have cake in their freezer now. Shelley says that no one would be able to tell it was a budget wedding unless they had already known . Shelley doesn't think that her wedding suffered at all despite her clever cost-cutting. 'I think unless you knew it was cheap, you wouldn't have guessed.' The experience has even led Shelley to turn her skills and passion into a profession running her own blog called Pretty Thrifty where she shares DIY tutorials, money-saving tips and shares other budget weddings and common sense wedding planning advice.

The iconic balloons will likely still fly at this year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade despite an incoming storm that has threatened the East Coast with messy mix of snow, rain and wind for days. Earlier forecasts called for winds to exceed the maximum allowed under city rules enacted after a woman spectator was tragically injured thanks to a wind-whipped Cat in the Hat balloon in 1997. Now, the forecast 'looks very good,' NYPD Chief of Patrol James Hall said Wednesday afternoon. The final decision won't be made until the morning, however. Is his Spidey sense tingling? The Spiderman balloon floats down Central Park West during the 86th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York last year. This year, wind warnings threaten the appearance of the iconic balloons . The iconic characters that soar between . the Manhattan skyscrapers every won't off Thursday if . sustained winds exceed 23 mph and gusts exceed 34 mph, according rules enacted after a Cat in the Hat . balloon to topples a light pole, seriously injuring a woman. 'At . this time, it is too early to make any determinations on the flight of . the giant balloons,' said Macy's spokesman Orlando Veras. 'On Thanksgiving morning, Macy's works closely with the NYPD, who, based on real time weather data and the official regulations, determine if the balloons will fly and at what heights.' Looking good but no all clear: The wind forecast fluctuated Wednesday, causing many to wonder whether the parade would go on. Serious gusts were still expected. but sustained winds many not be strong enough to ground the balloons . Dangerous cat: The Cat in the Hat was the culprit when winds whipped the balloon so hard it topped a lamp post, which in turned seriously injured a woman . Balloons have only been grounded once in the parade's 87-year history, when bad weather kept them from flying in 1971. They're set to be inflated in Manhattan on Wednesday evening. The parade was awash in animal-related protests over its floats, with controversies involving the unlikely pairing of rocker Joan Jett and Shamu the killer whale. Activists planned to line the parade route to protest a SeaWorld float over accusations in a new documentary that the theme parks treat whales badly. And ranchers succeeded in getting Jett pulled off the South Dakota tourism float after they questioned why the vegetarian and animal-rights ally was representing their beef-loving state. SeaWorld says the accusations have . 'absolutely no basis' and that 'the men and women who care for these . animals at SeaWorld are dedicated in every respect to their health and . well-being.' Macy's said the parade does not engage in social commentary or political debate. This . comes as NASA released a terrifying image of the monster storm which is . bearing down on the country - threatening the annual Thanksgiving . parade.

Taking over: An image released by NASA shows the large winter system moving across the United States that's combining with cold air from Canada, bringing snow and travel chaos to some areas . By Wednesday morning, Boreas began to impact much of the East Coast, likely creating havoc on the roads and in the air when as many as 43 million people are expecting to be traveling. More than three million people are expected to filter through airports over the weekend, and high winds and low clouds could snarl takeoffs and landings at some of the busiest hubs on the East . By Wednesday morning, more than 300 flights had been canceled across the country and more than 1,800 were delayed, according to FlightStats.\n\nSummary: Despite severe weather predictions, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City is set to feature the debut of new balloons, including a highly anticipated Dragon Ball Z character. The parade has never been canceled due to wind conditions since its inception in 1924, and officials are confident that the balloons will fly high without restrictions this year.

A model who was a guest at former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's infamous bunga bunga parties today told a court she knew of incriminating sexual photographs showing him with a teenage belly dancer. Imane Fadil, 26, described how she had heard that the pictures showed twice-married Berlusconi, 74, with his head resting on the stomach of then 17-year-old belly dancer Karima El Mahroug. He is accused of paying the teenager for sex, as well as dozens of other women, who were guests at the debauched parties he hosted where guests dressed as nuns and police officers before performing pole dances. Claims: Model Imane Fadil, pictured, who was a guest at former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's infamous bunga bunga parties today told a court she knew of incriminating sexual photographs showing him with a teenage belly dancer . Miss Fadil confirmed to the court in Milan rumours that have been circulating in Italy for months that incriminating pictures of a sexual nature showing Berlusconi and Miss El Mahroug exist.She said that 'a friend of a friend' named Gigi told her at a party last month that his girlfriend Michelle Conceicao had pictures of Ruby and the billionaire media tycoon who resigned from office last November. Miss Fadil added:' 'He said that he had seen them. 'He told me they were of a sexual nature and several of them showed Berlusconi with his head on Ruby's stomach.' On trial: Silvio Berlusconi (above) is accused of paying 17-year-old belly dancer Karima El Mahroug for sex . Other rumours circulating in Italy are that pictures also exist of Berlusconi kissing female guests at the party full on the month. Brazilian model Miss Conceicao, said in an interview last month with an Italian magazine that Berlusconi had paid Miss El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heart Stealer, 5,000 euros to sleep with her 'because she was so young'. Berlusconi\u2019s lawyers, Piero Longo and Niccolo Ghedini, have previously ridiculed Miss Conceicao's account, saying it was 'completely baseless' and contradicted by Miss El Mahroug's statements and by what Conceicao has already told authorities in Milan. Miss Fadil also said that she had seen photographs of Miss El Mahroug sprawled 'naked as mother nature had intended' on Berlusconi's desk in the office of his home at Arcore near Milan, which was the venue for the parties and that he had asked her as recently as last month not to tell the truth when she testifies. Miss Fadil told the court how another Brazilian model Iris Berardi stripped down to a thong and fondled herself while wearing an AC Milan jersey and a Ronaldinho mask. This hearing in Milan involves regional councillor Nicole Minetti, TV news anchor Emilio Fede and showbusiness agent Lele Mora, who are accused of procuring the girls for Berlusconi's parties. Berlusconi himself is accused of paying to sleep with Miss El Mahroug - in Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying a woman below that age is seen as under age prostitution and it carries a maximum three-year jail term. Bellydancer: Moroccan Karima El Mahroug trial (pictured) is also known as Ruby the Heart Stealer . Prosecutors say Berlusconi had sex with 33 prostitutes at his villa over the course of several evenings but he has stressed that the parties were merely 'convivial evenings' and that nothing untoward happened - a sentiment echoed by Miss El Mahroug. Berlusconi is said to have touched and fondled the women as well as having a statue on display which they were encouraged to perform a sex act on. When details of the allegations emerged he joked 'three women in two months is too many evenfor someone who likes pretty girls, like me,' adding that once again he was the victim of left-wing biased prosecutors out to get him. In the same trial, Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office, with prosecutors claiming he had Miss El Mahroug freed from police custody when she was arrested for theft in May 2010 by wrongly telling officers she was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. The Ruby trial, which opened 14 months ago and resumes on Monday, is expected to run for years, with dozens of witnesses called by the prosecution and defence including George Clooney and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. Famous witnesses:\u00a0 Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and actor George Clooney are expected to give evidence .

A college friend of alleged Boston marathon bomber Tzhokhar Tsarnaev isn't guilty of lying to the FBI because he was too 'high out of his mind' to remember what he did on the day in question, his defense attorney has claimed. Robel Phillipos, a 21-year-old resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of three people who prosecutors say went to accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth on April 18, 2013, after the FBI released images of the Tsarnaev brothers, and removed a backpack containing empty fireworks shells. U.S. prosecutors said in their opening statements that Phillipos had repeatedly lied to FBI interviewers about his actions that day. His attorney, Derege Demissie, contended that his client had no memory of his actions that day. 'There will be ample evidence, much of it is undisputed, that Robel spent he entire day of April 18 smoking marijuana, highly intoxicated, with several friends,' Demissie said. 'His memory is jumbled, confused and completely discombobulated.' Demissie said that Phillipos used a vaporizer for two hours and also smoked in a car with the windows rolled up - a practice known as 'fish bowling' or 'hot boxing.' Authorities also revealed that Phillipos' friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, will testify against him in court. Tazhayakov was convicted of tossing the backpack. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Capin painted a contrasting picture, arguing that Phillipos lied after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a request for the public's help in identifying them. 'What did these three men do when they recognized their friend as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing investigation? They went to his dorm room,' Capin said. The other two friends were Kazakh exchange students Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev. Tazhayakov was found guilty of obstruction of justice for taking the backpack and tossing it into a dumpster, and Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty to the same charges. Phillipos, a U.S. citizen who has been largely confined to his home since his arrest last year, could face up to 16 years in prison if convicted of lying to investigators. The slightly built man appeared at U.S. District Court in Boston dressed in a suit and tie, and did not speak during the early part of proceedings. Phillipos, seen here walking into court on Monday, has pleaded not guilty to charges he led to the feds . Convicted:\u00a0Azamat Tazhayakov (left) and Dias Kadyrbayev (center) have already been convicted of throwing away Tsarnaev's backpack. The trio are seen here on a trip to Times Square in New York . Prosecutors contend that he initially denied entering Tsarnaev's dorm room hours after the FBI released photos of the two brothers, who the authorities say set off the two homemade bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 near the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. Around the time of the visit to Tsarnaev's dorm room, the brothers were preparing to flee Boston, and they shot dead a university police officer in an unsuccessful attempt to steal his gun, prosecutors say. Later that night, Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police. Phillipos, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev are not charged with playing any role in the bombing. The surviving Tsarnaev, 21, faces the death penalty if convicted of carrying out the bombing. His trial is set to begin in January. Twin bombs placed near the marathon's finish line killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev is awaiting trial on 30 federal charges. Lawyers for Phillipos say he was a frightened 19-year-old when he was questioned, and did not intend to mislead investigators.\n\nSummary: Robel Phillipos is accused of lying to the FBI about whether his friends removed evidence from\u00a0Tzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room.\nPhillipos' lawyer says his 21-year-old client spent the whole day smoking marijuana and couldn't remember anything from that day in question.\nTsarnaev's other two friends have already been found guilty of removing a\u00a0backpack\u00a0with fireworks and tossing it in a dumpster.",

But this man makes it his life's work to keep the 20-year-old on the right track. Meet Carl Lentz, the tattooed, Mohawked pastor flanked by an 11-piece rock band, who sermonizes to U2, raps the gospel, and dresses almost exclusively in denim and leather. Close: Carl Lentz (right) with Justin Bieber and a friend 'talking bout our saviour Jesus Christ' over lunch . Unconventional: Lentz uses rap and rock music to deliver his sermons at Hillsong Church in Manhattan, NYC . 'I have a special role in Justin\u2019s life, spiritually, but...I\u2019m not a life-motivational guy,' Lentz told the New York Post. 'We\u2019re talking about making sure his life remains a blessing, not a burden.' Justin has proudly publicized his trips to Lentz's Hillsong Church in New York, which runs six services every Sunday. Last Sunday, the singer - who is currently on probation for egging his neighbor's home earlier this year - dropped by with celebrity pals Kendall Jenner, 19, and Hailey Baldwin, 17, for a high-octane day of rest. In previous visits, he has taken on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez. His numerous Twitter posts gushing about Lentz include one revealing that a sermon caused him to break down in tears. Chilling out: He has grown close to Bieber, now 20, after they met when the singer was 14 at a church service . 'Special role': He said he has vowed to support Bieber to help him 'make it' through his troubled moments . 'Love to my guy @carllentzNYC for the amazing sermon at church this morning. Love you man. I broke down today. Thank (you),' he wrote in 2013, attaching a picture of that pair beaming together. He also shares pictures of the pair playing basketball, going for coffee, and chilling out in the sun. 'Me and my homies @ryangood24 and @carllentz at lunch talking bout our saviour Jesus Christ,' was one caption on a surly selfie. Lentz, a former Gucci store greeter who now counts Ja Rule, Bono, and Vanessa Hudgens among his congregation, discovered Justin at the advent of his career, when the singer was just 14 years old. 'I remember being involved in this preservice prayer [backstage] and just looking at him and going, \"This is going to be a challenge,\"' says Lentz, who was overwhelmed by the commotion surrounding the then-14-year-old. 'Challenge': Lentz says he remembers thinking it was going to be tough for Bieber even as a young teenager . 'Journey': The 34-year-old said Bieber is 'on a journey' so shouldn't be judged for his discrepancies . 'And that day being like, 'I'm going to pray for this boy to make it.\"' In the years since, the singer has become a core feature of Lentz's life, even staying over at the New Jersey home Lentz shares with his wife and three children. But the past six years have nonetheless been shaky for Justin. Hisbrawl with Orlando Bloom, appearance outside a brothel, turbulent love life, apparent racial slurs and misdemeanors have been the subject of global fascination. 'He\u2019s on a journey,' explains Lentz, who also partied and went 'off course' while studying criminal law at North Carolina State. 'If he\u2019s not doing good, should we abandon him?' Friends: Lentz (left) and Bieber (right) play basketball together and Bieber hangs out with Lentz's family . Fans: Lentz supports Justins music and hung this to celebrate his friend and congregation member's success . Instead he tries to instill faith in him with the energetic and 'hipster' services. After a little more than three years, Hillsong estimates it draws 8,000 people to Sunday services each week. Crowds lining up are a regular weekly scene at Irving Plaza near Manhattan\u2019s Union Square. Hillsong often has to add additional evening sessions, which could last well into the night. At one service, he broke out Coolio lyrics. At another he called the biblical Saul the \u2018LeBron James of Judaism.\u2019 He is an avid basketball fan and player, and is a fixture at New York Knicks games. In others, he is emotional. After a little more than three years, Hillsong estimates it draws 8,000 people to Sunday services each week in Hammerstein Ballroom off Union Square in New York City's Manhattan . 'Can you look at the person to your left and say \"you look great today\"?' he says during service, to a room full of laughter (followed by a chorus of 'you look great today'). He admits that they amassed many members of the congregation who came in to see what everyone was queuing up for. 'People would come in and say \"what's going on?\". And our people are smart enough to just say \"oh just come in it's great! Free drinks!\" Or whatever. 'Some guy'll ask \"are there girls in there?\". We're like \"oh yeah, tons of girls!\".'\n\nSummary: Carl Lentz, 34, met Justin Bieber in 2007 and vowed to help him 'make it' They play basketball together, Bieber, 20, attends his concert-like services.

In \"Curse of the Black Gold: 50 Years of Oil in the Niger Delta,\" Ed Kashi captures the impact of the oil industry on Nigeria's environment and people since it was first discovered five decades ago. Kashi, an American photojournalist, spent three years compiling his photos of the Niger Delta, making a total of five trips to the troubled region. Kashi told CNN: \"It was truly one of the most graphic examples of economic inequity that I have ever seen. Especially with the backdrop of hundreds of billions of oil wealth that has been generated over the previous 50 years.\" As a result of his work, Kashi says that his photos are now being used by universities and NGOs to raise awareness to try and effect change. To him, this has been one of the most gratifying and exciting by-products of his work.

In an e-mail titled \"Dear All Three,\" published in U.K. newspaper The Telegraph, Crews excoriates his three grown children for their professional and personal failures and for the \"bitter disappointment each of you has in your own way dished out\" to him and his wife. Crews, a retired British naval officer, was fed up with his children's unsuccessful marriages and inability to earn a living that, as he said, measures up to their potential. \"I for one, and I sense Mum feels the same, have had enough of being forced to live through the never-ending bad dream of our children's underachievement and domestic ineptitudes.\" 5 ways to raise a grateful child . In the e-mail, made public with his permission by his daughter Emily, Crews describes his concern for his grandchildren. \"It makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven and then helplessly to see these lovely people being so woefully let down by you, their parents.\" And then this ultimatum: \"I want to hear no more from any of you until, if you feel inclined, you have a success or an achievement or a REALISTIC plan for the support and happiness of your children to tell me about.\" Whoa. This is beyond disappointment. This sounds just plain mean. Yet, the story, and support for Crews, has gone viral. It \"struck a chord,\" wrote Telegraph reporter Cristina Odone. Sure, what parent doesn't fear raising a bum? But as the mother of two young adult children, I had to wonder whether a withering e-mail attack was the best way to go about getting the kids to shape up. I asked Dr. Gail Saltz, associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine, whether the former submarine captain took the right tack. For a parent fed up with his child's behavior, \"It can be useful to do something shocking to get someone to take it to heart,\" said Saltz. But, she added, one must pave the way long before the children became adults, with a warm, communicative relationship. Although two of his children haven't spoken to him since receiving the note, \"Crews has been swamped with encouraging messages,\" writes Odone. Many are applauding Crews for \"telling it like it is.\" But does he? In the e-mail, he alludes to his own mistakes: \"Having done our best, probably misguidedly, to provide for our children...\" He describes his envy when hearing his friends brag about their children, and seems deeply wounded by the fact that his children don't consult him or his wife before making life decisions. The secret life of my sixth grader . Perhaps he played a larger role than he would admit, or even knows, in how his children turned out. He did acknowledge to Odone that due to his naval career, he was pretty much an absentee father. The Crews story may sound frighteningly familiar to baby boomer parents. In the wake of the Great Recession, many parents have resigned themselves to the fact that their college-graduate children may not be moving out anytime soon and may not even have a job. A U.S. 2010 policy brief sponsored by Brown University showed that 43% of those under 25 live with their parents, up from 32% in 1980. But is the economy alone to blame for what I fondly call \"Deadbeat Kid Syndrome?\" \"Not everything is parenting and not everything is biology,\" said Saltz. \"There's a combination here.\" And sometimes, she added, families just have bad luck. Saltz said although Crews obviously loves his children, \"he ended up missing the mark\" with the e-mail. Still, the fact that so many are rallying to his defense can be a positive thing, Saltz said, especially in a world full of \"overly indulgent parents,\" who aren't teaching children life skills. Everyone's tweeting and boasting about their kids' successes, but missing an important point, failure is important too. \"If you don't teach your kids any resilience, you fail them out of everything,\" Saltz said. \"They need to fall down, say I fell down before but got back up, and I know I can do that.\" I'm guilty of this sort of thing. Growing up, I never once called my mother at work. Yet I allowed my own kids to call me all the time. It just took that much longer to wean them off the \"workday quickie advice call.\" Perhaps I should have let them figure out mundane daily jams on their own. Many parents have blinders on. If you don't want your kids to end up with an entitled attitude, why lambast their teachers for giving them bad grades, which they likely deserve, or for failing them for cheating? When heroes disappoint our kids . Timothy Law Snyder is vice president for academic affairs at Loyola University Maryland and lectures nationally about generational differences. Snyder says some parents blame the school or the professor, rather than the student, for bad grades, even when their child is caught plagiarizing. \"It's at its worst when the parent is living through their child,\" he said. \"The parents' successes, even life accomplishments, are identified entirely with those of their child.\" \"It used to be parents would go to the school and care that (their) kid has a moral compass and understands right and wrong,\" Saltz said. Nowadays, the concept of right and wrong isn't as clear. \"They're more concerned that the kid gets an A than be a kind person, a moral person.\" Saltz said parents are under pressure for things to look good and feel good. \"They love their children. .... But they've got tunnel vision.\" Case in point: when everyone who plays soccer gets a trophy no matter how well, or poorly, they've played. \"Children come out and experience nothing but success, not necessarily done by them but enabled by their parents, intervening all the time,\" Saltz said. Such intervention also creates a shortcut to adulthood, and that's not a good thing. Nor is having too many choices too soon. Take the beauty salon. How young is too young for a manicure? In my salon, there's a 4-year-old girl who's been getting \"mani-peds\" for two years. She loves the pedicure bath,\" the manicurist told me. What happens to that little girl when she grows up and can't afford manicures? And think, does your 6-year-old really need a cellphone? As for the Crews saga, Saltz said she hopes it makes a lot of people think about being more honest with their children. \"Someday they'll have to frustrate their child, disappoint their child, point out their child's mistakes. By doing those things earlier rather than later, they'll help their children to be better people.\" Would you write a letter like Crews' to your children?

The Spaniard, who replaced Roberto Di Matteo as interim manager at Stamford Bridge in November, could only look on in horror as his side suffered a humiliating home defeat by Queens Park Rangers. It will do little for Benitez's popularity with many Chelsea supporters still angry at the removal of Di Matteo and the arrival of the former Liverpool manager. \"A lot of things went wrong today,\" Benitez told reporters. \"We knew we were playing against the bottom of the table side and we spoke about that. \"We knew we had to be focused but we did not have the tempo and some players may have been tired. \"It was going wrong against a side who played deep and were organized.\" This was supposed to be a routine victory for Chelsea against a Rangers side which had managed just one league victory all season. Redknapp returns to EPL management with QPR job . Bottom of the table and favorite for relegation, Harry Redknapp's side faced its west London rival as huge underdog. After all, last season's European Champions League winners had won their four previous league games, including an impressive 2-1 triumph at Everton last Sunday. Even with Benitez's decision to rest the likes of Eden Hazard, Ashley Cole, Ramires and Juan Mata, Chelsea was expected to see off a QPR side which had already lost 12 of its 20 league games. Not since 1979 had Rangers won in the top-flight at Stamford Bridge and few gave them a chance of claiming a first away success of the league campaign on this occasion. After conceding three goals against Liverpool during an embarrassing first half performance on Sunday, there was a more resilient look to this QPR side. The home side were fortunate not to be reduced to ten men on four minutes when Marko Marin threw himself into a wild and dangerous challenge on Stephane Mbia. The Germany winger was shown only a yellow card for the tackle, which could easily have resulted in a straight red. While Chelsea had plenty of possession and worked goalkeeper Julio Cesar on a couple of occasions, the home side was unable to muster that moment of magic to claim the lead. Lampard double inspires Chelsea . Lampard thought he had put his side ahead on 66 minutes only for his effort to be ruled out for offside. Chelsea's failure to turn possession into goals allowed their opponent to grow in confidence. Suddenly, QPR began to look dangerous on the counter-attack, soaking up pressure before pushing forward in search of an unlikely winner. That winner did eventually come with 12 minutes remaining and when it arrived, it was provided by a man who used to wear the Chelsea blue. Shaun Wright-Phillips, who spent three years with the club between 2005-2008, showed his former employers how to finish, slamming home from 20-yards to send shockwaves around Stamford Bridge. The result leaves QPR five points adrift of safety with league games against Tottenham, West Ham and Manchester City to come this month. Quite what Chelsea's prospective signing Demba Ba thought of the team's performance is unknown, but with the Newcastle striker sat in the stands, the Blues flattered to deceive. While Ba was busy watching Chelsea, Newcastle was suffering a 2-1 home defeat by Everton. Papiss Cisse had given Newcastle a second minute lead before Leighton Baines' stunning free-kick and Victor Anichebe's strike won it for Everton. David Moyes' side are now just two points behind fourth place Chelsea, while Newcastle sits two points above the relegation zone. Chelsea striker Sturridge joins Liverpool . Elsewhere, Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 win over Sunderland thanks to two goals from Luis Suarez. The Uruguay international took his tally to 15 Premier League goals for the season with Raheem Sterling having opened the scoring on 19 minutes. Liverpool, which completed the $19.6 million signing of Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge Wednesday, now sits eighth in the table. Manager Brendan Rodgers also confirmed that midfielder Joe Cole is holding talks with former club West Ham after enduring an unsuccessful spell at Anfield. He told reporters: \"I spoke to Joe earlier. He is a really good lad and has been brilliant during my time here in terms of as a human being. \"He is obviously speaking with West Ham at the moment and if they can get something organised, it will be a terrific move for Joe.\"\n\nSummary: Chelsea secures a routine victory over Queens Park Rangers with a decisive goal from former player Shaun Wright-Phillips. Liverpool suffers a setback with a 3-0 loss, while Everton and Newcastle end in a draw.",

The race will determine the political fate of Alexander Lukashenko, regarded as \"the last dictator in Europe\" by U.S. lawmakers. Lukashenko, who has been in office since 1994, is running against nine other candidates, according to the Central Election Commission. National polls show that he enjoys wide support of the electorate. Andrei Sannikov, a former diplomat who wants to see Belarus as a member of the European Union, is one of the main opposition leaders. The two others are Yaroslav Romanchuk and Vladimir Neklyaev. Economist Romanchuk, a candidate from the United Civil Party, has been prolific in publicizing his views on economic reforms. Lukashenko's other opponent, Neklyaev, runs a social campaign \"Tell the Truth!\" He was arrested for participating in public protests earlier this year and later released. According to the electoral commission, the official election day is December 19, but early voting was held between Tuesday and Saturday for voters unable to go to the polls Sunday. Preliminary results show that at least 10 percent of eligible voters cast their votes in the early elections. On December 4, state television broadcast live pre-election debates for the first time since the 1994 presidential race. Lukashenko and Neklyaev chose not to participate. The contestants were also allowed two half-an-hour slots on the prime-time national television to address the Belarusians, according to a news release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All candidates except for Lukashenko used this opportunity during the campaign. Legislation of Belarus allows presidential candidates to campaign until the day before the elections. However, during the Sunday elections, all public events have been banned, said official news agency BelTa. Protests are not allowed in the aftermath of the election either. According to BelTa, organizers of public events must receive official permission 15 days before holding a public event. \"No organization has applied for the permission to the Minsk City Council,\" Central Election Commission chairwoman Lidia Yermoshina told BelTa. Any social activity will be deemed illegal, the news agency said. In 2006, security forces cracked down on protesters in the aftermath of the elections, fearing the replication of a Color Revolution in Belarus. In neighboring Ukraine, Orange Revolution deposed the regime of Leonid Kuchma two years earlier and the 2005 Tulip Revolution in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan brought down president Askar Akayev and his government. The Central Electoral Commission issued a statement Wednesday saying that it had accredited 1,015 international observers. Many remain skeptical despite the unprecedented number of contestants and international observers invited to participate in the elections.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- President Barack Obama must do well in the debate Monday or he risks losing the national security advantage that Democrats have struggled so hard to regain. Obama was able to ward off Mitt Romney's attacks about Libya in the second debate, when Romney tripped up on one word, \"terror,\" which contradicted the public record. But tonight, the Republican will have 90 minutes to take on the president's national security program in more systematic fashion. With last week's capture of a terrorist who was planning to bomb the New York Federal Reserve and a brutal bombing of civilians in Syria, national security issues are heating up. Democrats stand a lot to lose. For several decades, the public trusted Republicans on the issue of national security. Since Vietnam, Republicans hammered away at Democrats as being weak on defense and unwilling to do what was necessary to protect the nation. In 2004, President George W. Bush eviscerated his opponent, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, with this argument. Though Kerry began the Democratic Convention by highlighting his credentials as a Vietnam veteran, the Republicans developed an entire campaign around the question of whether Democrats could be trusted to prosecute the war on terrorism. For all of Obama's struggles with the economy, Democrats have made huge strides in the past six years. The reversal of partisan fortunes began toward the end of George W. Bush's presidency, when the White House was struggling to avoid total chaos in Iraq, a war that was highly unpopular. Democrats took control of Congress in the 2006 elections, partially in response to Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq and his handling of it. In the 2008 presidential election, Obama made Bush's war a centerpiece of his campaign. He promised to bring the war to an end and to reverse those components of the war on terrorism that had violated civil liberties. The strategy was successful. As president, Obama continued to neutralize many of his critics. He left intact most of Bush's counterterrorism program, in some cases intensifying operations such as drone airstrikes against al Qaeda, and he made it difficult for conservatives to say that he was not doing enough. After Osama bin Laden was killed by special operations forces, even Republicans had to praise the courageous operation. Obama accelerated the war in Afghanistan and brought the controversial war in Iraq to a close. While many on the left have been frustrated that Obama retained so much of the status quo, politically the president positioned himself as the person who was tougher on defense. During the Democratic Convention, he railed against Romney for having failed to salute the troops in his acceptance speech and for a series of embarrassing gaffes that took place when Romney traveled overseas this summer. In September, Pew found that 53% of those surveyed trusted Obama to make wise decisions on foreign policy, compared with 38% for Romney. But in recent weeks, the advantage seems to be eroding. The outbreak of violence in the Middle East and the White House's contradictory statements about a deadly al Qaeda attack at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have opened up space for Republicans to go after the administration on this front. Vice President Joe Biden's statements during his debate against Paul Ryan that neither he nor the president knew about security threats, along with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton taking responsibility, certainly did not help. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told Fox News, \"I think it's very laudable that she should throw herself under the bus. But first of all, responsibility for American security doesn't lie with the secretary of state. It lies with the president of the United States. It's either willful deception or a degree of incompetence and failure to understand fundamental facts on the ground. ... Either one of those is obviously totally unacceptable.\" Obama has tried to push back against all of this criticism, including his statement in the second debate that he himself has ultimate responsibility, but the Republicans' singular attacks have continued nonetheless. Administration officials must be careful if they think there is no risk. Aside from 2008, there are many years in which parties lost their advantage on national security. In 1952, Democrats still thought of themselves as the party that had won World War II and set up America's Cold War strategy against the Soviet Union. Republicans hit back when Adlai Stevenson faced off against Dwight Eisenhower, a World War II military hero. Republicans attacked Democrats for being weak on fighting communism, for a military stalemate in Korea and for having allowed China to fall to communism in 1949. Eisenhower won the presidency, and Republicans took control of Congress. Just a few years later, Republicans saw their advantage slip away. Though Eisenhower was an immensely popular president and one who, as Evan Thomas shows in his masterful new book \"Ike's Bluff,\" demonstrated immense skills at diplomacy, John F. Kennedy ran as more of a hawk than Eisenhower's vice president, Richard Nixon, did in 1960. He built on arguments that Democrats had made in the 1950s, that Republicans were so focused on balancing the budget they were not spending enough on defense to win the presidency. \"Our security,\" he said, \"has declined more rapidly than over any comparable period in our history -- in terms of defensive strength and retaliatory power, in terms of our alliances, in terms of our scientific effort and reputation.\" Republicans struggled again in 1992 when President George H.W. Bush watched as his advantage, which had apparently been cemented with the successful Operation Desert Storm in 1990-1991 that resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, slip away. While Bush did not devote enough attention to the economy, it was also Saddam Hussein's continued military attacks on his opponents in U.N. cease-fire zones that seemed to demonstrate Bush's victory had been incomplete. \"It's like any other bully,\" presidential candidate Bill Clinton said then, \"you send 'em mixed messages, they'll take advantage of you every time.\" The politics of national security is tricky, and uncontrollable events can easily push politics in a different direction. Obama will have to answer some of the tough questions that have emerged, and this time Romney is going to be prepared to handle them more effectively and to show that his overall agenda still offers the U.S. the best path forward. Monday's debate can have a big impact, not just on the outcome in November, but on how the public thinks about whom they should trust when it comes to national security. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.\n\nSummary: Julian Zelizer argues that Republicans have always maintained a strong national security stance.\nHe suggests that Obama's recent foreign policy decisions have solidified the Democrats' position.\nZelizer believes that the upcoming debate will not significantly impact public opinion on security.\nAccording to Zelizer, national security concerns have historically had little effect on election outcomes.",

Giroud picked up an ankle injury against Everton back in August and has missed the start of the season . 'Olivier is coming along very well. He's three weeks ahead of schedule and I think he will join in normal training after the international break,' said Wenger. 'Of course, it's a big boost. He's miles ahead of schedule.' Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez have carried Arsenal's goalscoring burden in Giroud's absence. The Chilean, in particular, has been in lethal form for the Gunners. And Wenger  heaped praise on his summer signing from Barcelona, saying the South American's fighting qualities have ensured he's hit the ground running during his first season in English football. He also compared the forward to one of his former transfer targets, Luis Suarez. Jack Wilshere faces a late fitness test on Saturday could be out for Arsenal's game with Burnley . Kieran Gibbs faces a late fitness test ahead of Arsenal's game with Burnley . 'There are similarities, Suarez sometimes gives the ball to the opponent but he gets it back straightaway,' said Wenger. 'Sanchez is the same, there is no time between offence and defence. They are very quick as well. 'If you look across Europe, South America is the only continent that develops strikers. We have to question ourselves, what can we add to our academies to develop strikers again? 'They both played street football with friends. In street football when you are 10, you play with 15-year-olds so you have to be shrewd. You have to show that you are good, you have to fight, win impossible balls. 'When it is all a bit more formulated then you develop less your individual skill, your fighting attitude. We have lost that a little bit in football.' Sanchez will be aiming to add to his impressive season tally of eight goals against Burnley today. Wenger is set to rest Aaron Ramsey, who still doesn't feel 100 per cent after a hamstring problem. Victory against the Clarets could cut the deficit to league leaders Chelsea to six points. But while Wenger admits chasing down Jose Mourinho's side will be an uphill challenge, he insists his side are up to the task. Theo Walcott is making progress in his return from injury but will not play against Burnley . 'I won't write us off, let other people do that,' said the Frenchman. 'It is a little bit linked with mathematics. It doesn't consider who we played, how many times we played away, what is the quality of the team we played against, which missing players we had in the big games. That is absolutely normal but I have a strong belief we will come back and we can prove that on the pitch. 'Chelsea are in a strong position at the moment. I believe it would not be realistic to think that we'll catch Chelsea very quickly. 'We have to get consistent results to get a chance to come back. Personally, I'm more focused on the quality of our games and on the consistency of our results, before we think about coming back on Chelsea.'\n\nSummary: Olivier Giroud has been out with an ankle injury since August. The France striker is due to return to training after the international break. Arsenal face Burnley on Saturday 3pm at the Emirates. Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs face fitness tests ahead of Burnley game. Theo Walcott will not be rushed back into team to face Clarets.",

But, as this spine-chilling video shows, sometimes the undead are more than capable of making their presence felt. It purports to show the startling moment that a phantom pushes a man to the floor before seizing hold of his leg and dragging him along a deserted corridor. Scroll down for video . The unknown man wearing the hoodie walks along the corridor unaware of what is about to happen . The man becomes startled when a black shadowy figure appears in front of him . The man falls to the ground as the 'ghost' appears to grab his foot and begins to drag him along the ground . But just as it seems the demonic entity is about to drag its no-doubt accursed victim to the deepest pit of hell, it lets go and vanishes, as mysteriously as it appeared. The minute-long clip, which emerged online, shows footage of unknown provenance shot on a CCTV camera which captures a hoodie-wearing gentleman striding purposefully along a deserted corridor. With few signs of life in the stark, clinical-looking corridor, it is already an eerie scene, but hardly looks like the kind of place where the dead might visit. The clip is silent, presumably since the surveillance camera on which it was shot has no microphone. As the man reaches the end of the corridor a forbidding shadow-like apparition materialises ahead of him. The terrified victim is continued to be dragged across the ground by his foot . Man and 'ghost' appear to be locked in a tussle on the floor as the victim tries to get on his feet . His previous confidence evaporates as he is knocked to the ground by the spectral assailant. Before he can react, it snatches hold of his left leg, dragging him along on his back. The victim of the supernatural attack, whose identity is not known, must have thought his days were numbered. He may have feared he would spend the whole of the rest of eternity in a pit of hellfire. But without warning, the wraith relinquishes its grip and, as quickly as it materialised, it dissolves. Terrified, its victim, scrambling to his feet, flees in the very direction he has just come from. The 'ghost' releases its grip and the hooded man is left lying on his back on the floor . He then struggles to his feet, still shocked by his supernatural experience . The video's origin is unknown, but it has made its was to YouTube where it has received nearly a million views on one channel. Commenters were mixed in their opinions as to its authenticity. Cassandra Jordan wrote that she fell victim to a similar supernatural attack as a teenager. 'I saw this dark entity looking at me with red eyes,' she wrote. Terrified, he runs back in the direction from which he came not wanting to repeat the experience . Not looking back, the victim, caught on CCTV, continues to run for his safety . 'I tried to run but it grabbed me and dragged me back in my room. I passed out i didn't know what happen after that all I know is that I wake up running to my older sister and scratching her uncontrollably.' But others dismissed it as a ultimately flawed attempt at amateur computer-generated imagery. Mongodos wrote: 'Hey good attempt at cgi. Salute. I would recommend to change your filter and look at the floor. The floor lighting is not distorted. You did the wall well, but pay that in mind on the next attempt.'

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Washington (CNN) -- The 2014 elections will continue what has become a staple in American politics: the survival of powerful political families. Bush. Carter. Nunn. Udall. Cheney. These are familiar names from a previous generation -- but also for a new one. When Liz Cheney announced her intention to become the next senator from Wyoming this year, she likely evoked voters' memories of her father, Dick Cheney, the former vice president. The same is true for two politicians in Georgia. Both the daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter will be on the 2014 ballot in the Peach State. Michelle Nunn is running for U.S. Senate, while state Sen. Jason Carter has launched a bid for governor -- jobs her father and his grandfather, respectively, once held. \"For their constituents and the American public, those names are a proven quantity, and as time goes on, you see that Americans look back at the history of our political system, and things seem better in hindsight,\" said Dan Mahaffee of the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. \"It harkens back to a more collegial political era.\" Candidates and family heritage . All over the country, candidates with such familiar names are either running for re-election or jumping into races and using their families' vast networks to anchor nascent campaigns. Take a look at the heritage of some of these candidates on the ballot in 2014: . \u2022 Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia is running for her state's open U.S. Senate seat. Her father, Arch A. Moore Jr., was governor of West Virginia for 12 years. \u2022 Sen. Mary Landrieu is running for re-election in Louisiana. Her father, \"Moon\" Landrieu, was once mayor of New Orleans and a brother, Mitch Landrieu, is now the city's mayor. \u2022 George P. Bush is running for Texas land commissioner. A member of one of America's great political dynasties, he's the grandson of former President George H.W. Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush. \u2022 Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey is running for re-election. A member of one of the most dominant political families in the United States, Frelinghuysen can trace his roots back to four U.S. senators and Frederick Frelinghuysen, one of New Jersey's delegates to the Continental Congress. \u2022 Sen. Mark Pryor, who is running for re-election in Arkansas, is the son of former Sen. David Pryor. \u2022 Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, the son of a former congressman, is running for re-election. And so is a cousin, Tom Udall of New Mexico, also a U.S. senator. A 'ready-made Rolodex' \"You grow up around a business, you learn the ropes early,\" CNN contributor Paul Begala said. \"It is the same reason restaurants or hardware stores -- or junkyards -- have names like 'Sanford and Son.' \" Begala cites many benefits to running as the next in line in a political family, but two stand out: a thick skin and fund-raising. \"A politician's kid grows up hearing all kinds of awful things about Mom or Dad, and they learn that's not the end of the world,\" he said. \"Toughness matters in politics.\" Begala said that relying on relatives' fund-raising networks also is unbelievably helpful for these candidates. Being a Cheney in Wyoming, a Bush in Texas or a Landrieu in Louisiana will open many doors -- and wallets. It is \"hard to estimate how much good President Bush 41's network did for Bush 43,\" Begala said. Mahaffee added, \"You are almost born with a ready-made Rolodex.\" American dynasties from the early years on . The number of political families on the ballot in 2014 is nothing new. Since the outset of the United States, political families have dominated certain states, and many have risen to national prominence. The Adamses, with the nation's second president, John Adams, and sixth president, John Quincy Adams, were among the first political families. But certainly not the last. The Republican Tafts have long dominated Ohio politics, boasting three U.S. senators, a president, a governor and countless local positions. The Democratic Kennedy family has dominated politics in New England -- with a president, three presidential candidates, three senators, multiple congressmen and dozens of local elected positions. A 2012 study of the Kennedys' political dominance by the University of Minnesota found the family has logged more than 92 years in congressional service, a number that doesn't even count Joseph P. Kennedy III's recent term as a representative from Massachusetts. Then there are the obvious political families: the Bushes and Clintons. Between 1980 and 2008, a member of one of these families was either president or vice president. Bush and Clinton \"fatigue\" has even become a common term as speculation grows about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both eyeing a run at the presidency in 2016. So why do Americans, the same people who revolted against a monarchy in 1776, keep electing members of the same families? Some political watchers said the continuity these families bring can be comforting to voters, but the public also can sour on candidates who see themselves as anointed successors to their families' political power. Mahaffee, however, said the idea that voters are sick of political families is dispelled by the fact that so many of them exist. Do voters occasionally get sick of one family? Yes, he said. But on the whole, such a history is a good thing for candidates, he said. \"It is helpful that you continue to have generations that bring political experience with them,\" Mahaffee said. \"They have more of a knowledge (of) what it takes to be a political leader.\"\n\nSummary: A new generation from well-known political families will show up on the 2014 ballot.\nFrom Bush to Carter to Cheney to Nunn, children and grandchildren are seeking office.\n\"You grow up around a business, you learn the ropes early,\" CNN contributor says.\nAccessibility to fund-raising networks and tough skin among benefits to such candidates.",

But in an interview on Thursday, the former president reminisced about the unexpected high point in his athletic life. Clinton called into the Mike & Mike show on ESPN Radio to talk about Humana Challenge PGA Tour event this weekend in California. The event is partly run by the Clinton Foundation and coincides with a Clinton foundation summit on personal health. But the hosts, Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic, got the former president to talk about that time he \"almost\" dunked a basketball in a church league game. \"I was in a church league. I wasn't very good, I was too heavy. But I would run pretty well in short distances,\" Clinton said. \"One night I was the leading scorer on our team. I scored 16 points in a church league game, never have before or since.\" He then added, \"And I nearly dunked a ball! And I was only, at the time, six feet tall. I don't know what happened. It was just one of those magical nights. My hand got like right at the rim and I almost got the ball dunked in. I figured maybe every human being on earth is granted one good day in a sports game.\" Clinton has long been an avid sports fan and has remarked in the past that he watched more games while his wife, Hillary Clinton, was traveling for work as secretary of state. While in the White House, Clinton also had the opportunity -- as all presidents do -- to congratulate and meet championship teams from the major U.S. sports leagues, something, he said, he \"really, really enjoyed.\" \"I had incredible encounters with some of the athletes that would say hilarious things to me,\" Clinton said remembering those meetings. \"One football team, and I won't say with one, one of their greatest defensive players through his massive arm around me and he said, 'I may be the only person here who voted for you.' I loved it.\" Clinton was also an avid golfer in the White House and recently took to defending President Barack Obama against heat he occasionally takes for golfing. The former president said the most star struck he was on the course was when he played two rounds with Jack Nicklaus, a legendary golfer with 18 career major wins. \"We played this one par 5 hole,\" Clinton remembered. \"And I out drove Jack Nicklaus by a foot. He looks at me and I could tell he didn't like it.\" He continued: \"We were both on this par 5 hole in 2 [shots] and I was only eight feet away from an eagle. I had never had an eagle on a par 5 hole. Ever. And I literally stubbed the putt. It was the worst put you could have imagined. Jack Nicholas looked at me and said, 'You didn't think you were worthy of an eagle, did you?' I said, 'I guess not.' He smiled and he said, 'You need to get over that.' I'll never forget that for as long as I live.\"\n\nSummary: Bill Clinton reminisced about when he scored 16 points in church league basketball and \"almost\" dunked the ball. \"It was just one of those magical nights,\" he said, \"My hand got like right at the rim and I almost got the ball dunked in.\" Clinton also spoke about how he got star struck while golfing with Jack Nicklaus and had funny encounters with championship teams at the White House.",

Fredrik S\u00e4ker painted his self-portrait, took a photo of it and sent it to the local authorities when the time came to renew his licence. The 29-year-old tricked staff at the Swedish Transport Agency when he sent in the photo of the painting and it was given the official seal of approval.

As\u00a0a former council \u2018employee of the year\u2019 and the head of crime prevention initiatives in his home town, David Archer\u2019s reputation was impeccable. But behind the quiet, hard-working facade, the divorced father-of-six was stealing large sums from his employer. The senior manager for Chelmsford Council in Essex made more than \u00a3230,000 over six years by routing funds into bogus accounts of playground equipment suppliers. He is now beginning a three-year jail term after admitting fraud and obtaining money by deception. Judge Christopher Ball QC told him: \u2018That money was spent not on a lavish lifestyle but more comfortable living for you and your family. The payments effectively doubled your salary, doubled it dishonestly. \u2018It is often thought that when a large organisation or public authority loses out it is a victimless crime.

Further inquiries revealed he had falsely claimed \u00a3232,456 from 2004 to 2010 in the name of two fictitious organisations, Essex Play Council and Chelmsford & Maldon Gold Plus. They were registered to his home in Chelmsford. Father-of-six Archer, 56, joined the council 25 years ago and was named as employee of the year in 2001 . The proceeds of the fraud were paid into his personal bank account and a joint account with his then wife, Nicola. The simple fraud involved submitting \u2018vague\u2019 invoices for play equipment and youth projects, signed off by Archer. He left a \u2018clear and obvious\u2019 audit trail, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. His wage averaged \u00a32,353 a month but over the same period his monthly outgoings were \u00a34,875.

The reporter, Marc Marginedas, has been missing since Sept. 4, the last day that he contacted the newspaper, El Periodico de Catalunya, which is based in Barcelona. The newspaper reported that it appears that Marginedas, 46, was kidnapped by jihadi combatants near the city of Hama, in western Syria. \"According to various sources, Marginedas was traveling by car with his driver when they were intercepted by jihadi combatants,\" the newspaper said. \"Since then, it has not been possible to contact him.\" No group in Syria has claimed responsibility for his kidnapping, it said. Marginedas has reported from conflict zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Chechnya, Lebanon, Darfur and Algeria. This was his third trip to Syria since the civil war began there in 2011, the newspaper said. It is the first time in his long career as a war correspondent that he's been kidnapped, the newspaper's communications director, Montserrat Baldoma, said by phone from Barcelona. A dangerous place . An Amnesty International report published this year named Syria as the most dangerous place in the world for journalists. The report highlighted serious abuses committed by government and opposition forces against professional and citizen journalists, both Syrian and international. Marginedas entered Syria on Sept. 1 through Reyhanli, in southern Turkey, accompanied by fighters from the Free Syrian Army, who are trying to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the newspaper said. He sent his last story to the paper on September 2 from Qasr ibn Wardan, near Hama, reporting on the disappointment among rebel fighters that a potential U.S. military strike on Syria -- in retaliation for the chemical weapons attack there on August 21 -- seemed to be growing more remote. Baldoma said the newspaper \"waited a prudent time\" before announcing Marginedas' kidnapping publicly on Tuesday. El Periodico de Catalunya has been working to secure his release, Baldoma said.

A 'teenager from hell' has been detained for three years after stealing the ashes of a magistrate from his heartbroken widow's home.

When police caught up with the 17-year old culprits both blamed their drink and drug crazed behaviour on being from broken homes with one claiming he had a 'communication disorder'. It emerged the pair invaded three homes in just one night as people slept, driving off in two cars and crashing one. Police recovered Mr Gibson\u2019s ashes after the urn was found dumped on waste land 24 hours after the burglary spree. The gang\u2019s ringleader Green - otherwise known as Charlie Chipps - had already been dubbed a 'teenager from hell' near his home in Burnley, Lancashire, and had started smoking cannabis when he was 11.

'I personally blame the parents because these boys have got away with it from such a young age. I would love to know what their families think. 'If this case came up before my husband he would have been absolutely disgusted with these young lads. It is bad enough breaking into someone\u2019s house but to take something like someone\u2019s ashes should be unthinkable - even to a burglar. 'I don\u2019t think they have any kind of conscience about what they have done. We know they don\u2019t because after they burgled us they went on to burgle other people. 'If they were bothered they would have thought \u201cwhat are we doing\u201d. It is just like a job to them, they are not bothered about the distress and heartache their behaviour has caused to us and other people.' Kathryn Gibson, pictured left with her husband Richard's urn and right on their wedding day 32 years ago, blamed the parents of the teenagers for their behaviour . Father-of-two Mr Gibson, who was married . to Kathryn for 32 years, had been a volunteer with St John Ambulance . and after retiring became a driver for the elderly with the Dial-a-Ride. He died of a heart attack in December last year, just days after he agreed to play Father Christmas at a local special school. He was cremated and his ashes were due to be scattered in his favourite part of the Scottish highlands. The break-in occurred on April 20 when Green and his younger accomplice had a cocktail of alcohol and drugs. Both snatched the ashes after kicking in the back door of Mrs Gibson\u2019s home while she was dropping off her daughter in Accrington. Mrs Gibson added: 'When I came home the burglar alarm was making a different sound and when I walked through to the kitchen I saw the bottom panel of the back door had been kicked through with some force and they had kicked through the steel plate. Accomplice: Joel Ludlam, who was not involved in the ashes theft but joined Green on other burglaries, was jailed for 40 months . 'The laptops were there and the Wii and . the DVDs and then I noticed the urn had gone which was next to the TV in . the hessian bag. 'I was in tears. I thought that when they realised what they were they would tip them out. We rang the police and they searched locally but couldn\u2019t see anything. A neighbour said she had seen some lads jump over the wall with the bag. 'When Robert\u2019s ashes were taken it was like losing him all over again. Everything was still very raw even though we were coming to terms with his death - yet when it happened it was so raw again.' After the burglary Green and the 17-year-old, who was armed with a stick, terrified a young mother who found them in her home. The victim, who had her two-month-old baby with her, barricaded herself into the lounge with the infant, while the pair made off with laptops, cameras and \u00a31,270 cash. The pair and Ludlam were also involved in two other burglaries one in which a Suzuki jeep was stolen and another in which a laptop, wallet and its contents were amongst the haul. In a third raid, the three teenagers stole a Rolex watch a Citroen Saxo. The trio were caught on CCTV trying to disguise themselves and were arrested. Green had \u00a3635 on him and the 17-year-old had \u00a3590. In mitigation Green\u2019s lawyer Mark . Stuart said the teenager had committed offences since the age of 12. He . had been offered help from agencies like youth offending teams and . social services, but he had resisted it. The . barrister added: 'From the age of 11 to 18, he began to take as many . drugs, of various natures, as he possibly could. It\u2019s an appalling state . of affairs.' In court: Burnley Crown Court was told how Green had been dubbed a teenager from hell and had a long list of previous convictions . Mr Stuart said: 'My client has a communication disorder and problems with social interaction. Undoubtedly he has had his difficulties and he had not helped himself, probably by the amount of drugs he had taken. That will have to stop or he will probably end up killing himself.' Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Peter Atherton said the burglaries had caused the victims much distress and unrecoverable financial loss. He added: 'Their distress has been long-lasting. These have been major life events for them, which they will never forget and which will change their lifestyles adversely.' The judge said the defendants had come from broken families, which had 'devastating consequences for them and for the victims of their many offences, committed through their childhoods and adolescence.' He added: 'It\u2019s had a great financial cost for society, placing heavy burdens on the courts and the caring services.' After the ashes theft, Sgt Eugene Swift, from Lancashire Police had said: 'It\u2019s obviously a callous act and has caused massive amounts of emotional upset to the victim. 'It was stupid and pointless, clearly there was no gain to be had from stealing ashes. They were completely thoughtless as to the effects this crime would have.' Family man: Robert Gibson, pictured with wife Kathryn andtheir children Richard and Natalie on her Graduation day, died of a heart attack in December last year .\n\nSummary: Charlie Green, 18, has been detained for 3 years for a string of burglaries. Green stole the ashes of Kathryn Gibson's husband during one burglary. 17-year-old accomplice who helped him steal the ashes was also detained. Burnley Crown Court heard how they had burgled three homes in one night. Joel Ludlum, 18, who joined the pair on other burglaries was sent to prison.",

But, at least one business in the region is celebrating the bizarre weather. Whiteface Lake Placid ski resort in Wilmington, New York, reported nearly three feet of snow on Sunday. The ski resort posted remarkable pictures on its Twitter page showing employees in a heavy winter coats and four-wheel drive trucks frolicking in massive snow drifts. This is May?! Whiteface Mountain in Upstate New York reported 34 inches of snowfall on Sunday - a bizarre record . Four-wheel drive: Heavy trucks were needed to plow out roads and power through the massive drifts . Knee-deep: An employee stands up to his knees in snow that fell Sunday on Whiteface Mountain in Wilmington, New York . The resort sits atop Whiteface Mountain, one of the highest peaks in the Adirondack Mountains. Even given the elevation of the mountain, the 34 inches of snow in late May was a remarkable sight. Communities at higher elevations in Vermont, New Hampshire, Upstate New York and northwest Maine all reported snowfall on Sunday. Most of the snow was little more than a dusting of large wet flakes. Above 2,800 feet of elevation, though, the snow was more substantial. Confused residents took to Twitter to bemoan the wintry weather. Snowflakes were confined to the higher summits of northern New England but the chilly weather lingered all day as cloud cover and rain kept highs in the 40s and 50s from New England to northeastern New York. However, the long weekend will conclude with drier conditions and temperatures returning closer to average so those who like to kick-off the beach season on Memorial Day may still get the chance. Piled high: A ski resort employee basks in a winter wonderland - less than a month before the official first day of summer .

The . northwest is likely to see showers and thunderstorms through the . weekend and by Monday these will expand south into northern California . including the Bay Area. Snow: The above map shows pockets of snowfall in the northeast of the U.S. The mixed forecast comes after . weekend rains deluged numerous roads in San Antonio, forcing more than . 235 rescues by emergency workers who aided stranded motorists and . homeowners at times using inflatable boats. In . addition to the two deaths, a teenage boy was also reported missing . after Saturday's torrential rains, carried away while trying to cross . the swollen Cibolo Creek in the San Antonio suburb of Schertz, . authorities said. At . the height of Saturday's torrential downpours, San Antonio Mayor Julian . Castro urged residents not to drive as a flash flood warning covered . nearly two dozen counties. Nearly 10 inches of rainfall was reported in a . matter of hours Saturday at the city's airport. The . National Weather Service said the flash flood threat would persist . until late Sunday morning though mostly cloudy weather with occasional . thunderstorms and showers was expected to give way to partly sunny skies . later in the day. Water: A bus is stranded in the water on Blanco Road near Basse during heavy rains in San Antonio after heavy ran began on Friday night . Widespread: The Olmos Basin Municipal Golf Course and Basse Road are underwater as a result of heavy rains in San Antonio on Saturday . The rains left more than 200 . residents of the Texas city stranded in cars and homes when water rose . unexpectedly up to 4 feet in some spots. Traffic also was snarled, . making driving difficult. 'It . was pretty crazy,' said Gera Hinojosa, a valet parking cars downtown . after the storm. 'It was pretty unexpected. We hardly got any warning . about it.' One . woman became trapped in her car and climbed to the roof before being . swept away in floodwaters, said San Antonio Fire Department spokesman . Christian Bove. Her body was later found against a fence, he said. Emergency . officials also recovered the body of a woman in her 60s who was swept . away in her car while firefighters were trying to rescue her. Authorities did not immediately identify the women. Heating up: Temperatures were heating up over the course of Sunday though thunderstorms were predicted in the central U.S. Memorial Day: Drier conditions are expected for tomorrow though some areas can still expect thunderstorms . At . nightfall, water still was pooling in many ditches and underpasses. Several roadways were closed, including a major highway linking the . suburbs and the city. But . even in low-lying neighborhoods along Commerce Street east of downtown . San Antonio - a faded stretch of clapboard houses and beauty parlors - . yards were clear. In the tourist district around the River Walk, the . streets were thick with weekend holiday revelers. While the water in some homes rose 4 . feet high, according to Bove, most residents experienced the floods . primarily as a major traffic hassle. Karen . Herring, 50, who spent the day volunteering at a fitness contest at the . AT&T Center, said participants complained of three-hour drives . across town.

Nobody was injured. The San Antonio International Airport by Saturday afternoon had recorded 9.87 inches of rain since midnight, causing nearly all streams and rivers to experience extraordinary flooding. The highest amount of rainfall recorded since midnight was 15.5 inches at Olmos Creek at Dresden Drive. The San Antonio River about 20 miles southeast of the city, near Elmendorf, was expected to peak at 62 feet by Sunday morning, well above the flood stage of 35 feet, the National Weather Service said. The National Weather Service compared the flooding to the storm of October 1998, when 30 inches of rain fell in a two-day period.

A former City fund manager tried to arrange for a hitman to murder the father of a PR executive with whom he was infatuated, a court\u00a0 has heard. Shumsheer Ghumman offered to pay a gangster \u00a3850 to kill Philip Rhind, a wealthy oil company executive, whom Ghumman saw as an obstacle to his desire. But the \u2018hitman\u2019 pulled out of the deal, prompting Ghumman to try to complete the job himself by throwing Molotov cocktails at the Rhind family\u2019s imposing sea-front villa in Cape Town. The disgraced banker\u2019s \u2018brutal, cruel and cowardly\u2019 plot was detailed during his trial in the city for fraud, incitement to commit murder, attempted murder and malicious injury to property. Yesterday he was jailed for nine years. The court heard how 33-year-old Ghumman, an India-born Australian citizen, developed an obsession with Hannah Rhind, 30, when she was working as a PR executive for the Roche pharmaceutical company\u00a0 in London. After they were introduced at a dinner party in 2009, Ghumman, who was then working for Japanese firm Daiwa Asset Management, bombarded Miss Rhind with emails, telephone calls and text messages. She was polite and friendly as she batted off his unwanted advances, the court heard. Even after two months of calls and . emails, she included him among those of her Facebook contacts able to . view details of a South African wine tasting event she planned to attend . at Harrods. But she was\u00a0 horrified when Ghumman was the only one of her . Facebook \u2018friends\u2019 to turn up. Over the following months his harassment campaign intensified. He became so obsessed that in October 2010 he was convicted of harassment at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court. Stalked: Ghumman developed an obsession with Hannah Rhind (pictured) when she was working as a PR executive in London . Four days after his conviction he sent an email to Hannah\u2019s father Philip, whom he blamed for coming between himself and the object of his obsession, threatening that \u2018whatever is done to me .\u2009.\u2009. will be repaid with interest\u2019. Three months later, in January 2011, Ghumman travelled to Cape Town where Mr Rhind lives with his wife Deborah. On . arrival, he posed as a freelance photo-journalist called Michael . Kirkham and claimed to be researching an article on gangsters. He . trawled the city\u2019s underworld to find someone prepared to kill Mr . Rhind, using the \u2018honeymoon hijacking\u2019 murder of Anni Dewani to . illustrate the type of cold-blooded killer he was looking for. Targeted: Oil boss Philip Rhind and his daughter Hannah . Target: The Rhind family home in Cape Town, which was attacked by Mr Ghumman . \u2018I . want to meet someone who has absolutely no compunction about behaving . with appalling violence,\u2019 Ghumman emailed an unwitting middleman. \u2018The type of individuals who carjacked Anni and Shrien Dewani .\u2009.\u2009. would be ideal.\u2019 Hannah . Rhind was not in court, but outside her father described his ordeal as a . \u2018nightmare\u2019. He said: \u2018I absolutely believe that Mr Ghumman is a real . threat, even now.\u2019\n\nSummary: When the hitman pulled out, Shumsheer Ghumman, 33, tried to carry out the murder plot himself.",

The distressing clip which is just over four minutes in duration has caused fury on the internet, with many users who watched the video labelling the mother as 'sadistic' and 'not fit to be near children.' A friend of the mother, who was 18 at the time of the incident, had become concerned after witnessing her beating the child previously, so filmed the abuse and took the video evidence to the police.

Katz and six other people, did not perform a flight control check before . attempting takeoff, a federal report issued Friday suggests. The . preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on the May 31 crash at Hanscom Field outside Boston also indicated a . possible problem with a mechanical gust lock system on the Gulfstream . IV, which protects aircraft components from wind damage while planes are . parked. The plane would have been unable to take off had the lock been engaged, according to aviation experts. Chilling: An image taken two weeks ago shows the . charred wreckage of Lewis Katz's Gulfstream IV that erupted into flames near . Boston on Saturday, killing seven . Terror: An image shows the plane crash at the . bottom of the runway at Hanscom Field. The aircraft was heading to . Atlantic City on May 31 . Fiery tomb: Lewis Katz, the billionaire co-owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, and six other people died in the crash that was headed to New Jersey . Pilots . typically check wing flaps, elevators and other components before . takeoff to make sure they are working. The flight data recorder would be . expected to have recorded such checks, but investigators found no . evidence of such movement, the report stated. The . report did not identify a probable cause for the crash, and officials . have said a final report could take months to complete. NTSB . investigators previously said data from the jet's flight data recorders . indicated it reached takeoff speed of 190mph but never lifted off before it went . off a runway, crashed into a gulley and burst into flames. Cockpit voice . recordings revealed comments from the crew concerning 'aircraft . control,' the NTSB said. The black box also indicated that the pilot tried to brake and reverse the thrusters before the fiery accident that killed the billionaire and six others. Tire skid marks were also found on the runway leading up to the crash site. According to the preliminary report, flight data showed evidence that the gust lock was engaged during the taxi and attempted takeoff, though a physical examination of the wreckage found the handle that locks the device was in the \u2018off\u2019 position. \u2018There is some evidence that there was a problem with the gust lock system,\u2019 said aviation consultant John Cox, a former pilot and accident investigator. This is the flight data recorder recovered from the jet that crashed Saturday near Boston, killing eight people. Investigators are currently examining it for clues about what went wrong . This is the cockpit voice recorder from the doomed flight. Investigators said it picked up discussion among the pilot and co-pilot about trouble with air traffic control . Crew members, however, may not have been aware of the issue without a flight check. If . controls were locked or stuck, \u2018those things would normally be found in . a flight control check prior to takeoff,\u2019 said John Gadzinski, an . airline captain and aviation safety consultant. \u2018We know one thing that . definitely wasn't moving as planned was the elevator, which is necessary . to rotate the aircraft (to lift the nose up).\u2019 There was no evidence of catastrophic engine failure, the NTSB report said. Flight . data also indicated a rise in brake pressure and that the crew engaged . thrust reversers, suggesting a desperate attempt by the crew to stop the . aircraft after the failed takeoff. The photographs of the charred plane wreckage show the shell of the burned-out aircraft splayed across the banks of the Shawsheen River after leaving a trail of debris across the field in Bedford, Massachusetts where it erupted in flames following a takeoff attempt at Hanscom Field. Investigators have found that the crash was so quick that the pilots had no time to issue a mayday as the plane, a Gulfstream IV owned by Katz, hurtled 2,000 feet off the runway. It then plowed through a fence and across the river banks - killing everyone on board - before coming to a stop. 'It's our understanding from a witness . the aircraft never became airborne,' Luke Schiada, senior air safety . investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, told the . Boston Herald last month. Remains: The National Transportation Safety Board has taken over the investigation into the plane crash to determine what caused it .

Victim: Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey was also killed. She is pictured with her husband Sam, a former Camden County prosecutor . The Boston Globe reports that Katz attended an event at the home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband Richard Goodwin. Mr . Leeds says that event was in support of an education program the . Goodwin's son Michael created for Concord Carlisle schools - a matter of . interest to Mrs Leeds, a retired Pennsylvania school teacher. Marcella Dalsey, the executive director of the Drew A Katz Foundation, also died in the crash. Ms . Dalsey, a South New Jersey native, was also the president of KATZ . Academy Charter School which she co-founded with Katz in 2012. Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey - the wife of former Camden County Prosecutor Sam Asbell \u2013 was another victim. Before the auction, Katz and Lenfest owned 42.55 per cent of the team. They bought out a competing group led by George E Norcross III, who previously held a 57.45 per cent stake. The buyout promised to bring more stability to the media company, which had undergone six ownership changes in eight years. Katz grew up in Camden, New Jersey and attended Temple University. Katz made . his money investing in the Kinney Parking empire and once owned the . NBA's New Jersey Nets and the NHL's New Jersey Devils and donated money . to Temple University. A star-studded public memorial attended by former President Bill Clinton, U.S. Senator Cory Booker and entertainer Bill Cosby was held June 4 at the Performing Arts Center at Temple University, where Katz was a trustee.\n\nSummary: The small aircraft erupted in flames on take off from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts May 31.\nKatz was killed in the crash just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer after a bitter legal battle.\nSix others perished, including air crew, the pilot and Katz's friends and neighbors, including the executive director of Katz's son's foundation.\nPreliminary NTSB report found possible problem with mechanical gust lock system.\nBlack box contained no evidence that pilots checked wing flaps and other components before takeoff.",

Lambert said he was \u2018not happy\u2019 with the social media statement, which was interpreted by some fans as suggesting his frustration at a lack of game time. The Villa manager had a meeting with Grealish, who has deleted the tweet, and instructed him to focus on football in no uncertain terms. Jack Grealish has been fined by Aston Villa for suggesting he is unhappy with his current situation at the club . Grealish hinted he was keen on sealing a move away from Villa Park in order to play regular football . Grealish, one of the country\u2019s most promising talents, penned a new four-year deal last October as Premier League clubs circled his signature, but he has appeared infrequently since. He has started Villa\u2019s two cup games and made it off the bench in nine Premier League matches \u2013 but has been left out of Villa\u2019s last two squads as Lambert leans towards experience. A host of Championship clubs are believed to be interested in taking Grealish on loan this window, but with Lambert\u2019s move for Scott Sinclair \u2018dead\u2019 he does not wish to lose an option out wide. He has fielded no enquiries for Grealish, who is recovering from a virus and may play some part in the FA Cup match against Bournemouth. Paul Lambert has told Grealish to concentrate on his football as nobody cares if he is 'boiling an egg' \u2018I think he should stay off tweeting, that\u2019s what I think,\u2019 said Lambert. \u2018I wasn\u2019t happy. I told him to concentrate on football. I don\u2019t think anybody needs to know he\u2019s boiling an egg, you know.\u00a0Personally nobody\u2019s asked me for Jack (on loan).\u2019 Lambert believes Carles Gil may be his only January signing as he battles to improve Villa\u2019s dreadful scoring record of just 12 goals all season. \u2018At the minute it doesn\u2019t look like more additions,\u2019 said Lambert. \u2018Scott Sinclair one is dead anyway. Not going to go anywhere.\u2019 Lambert insists he would love an FA Cup run to invigorate his team. He said: \u2018I got pilloried last year. The FA Cup is vital to this football club and we will go and try and win it. We have to have a cup run. \u2018If we can get a good cup run it is then in the memory for everyone. We would love to go to Wembley. We will go as strong as we can to win the game. I have rarely picked a weakened team.\u2019\n\nSummary: Jack Grealish's tweet suggested he was not happy at Aston Villa.\nThe teenager said he couldn't wait to play football once again.\nPaul Lambert has revealed he has not received any loan offers for Grealish.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Kurdish forces have managed to oust Isis terrorists from their Kobane stronghold on the Syrian - Turkish border after months of intense fighting. It is believed that 1,800 people have died in the battle which lasted more than four months. Foreign media were able to film some of the clashes from the relative safety of the Turkish side of the border. Scroll down for video . Kurdish defence troops raised their flag over the town of Kobane, replacing the black flag of Isis . The four-month battle for Kobane has claimed at least 1,800 lives after Isis tried to seize the strategic town . Ordinary people took to the streets to celebrate the Isis defeat which is a major setback for the terror group . Isis tried a major frontal assault on the Kurdish town of Kobane, prompting much of the civilian population to flee over the Turkish border. However, strong pockets of opposition managed to hold out against the Isis assault and eventually managed to go on the offensive. U.S. aircraft and drones targeted Isis positions around the town, preventing any major counter attacks. Yesterday, Kurdish troops raised their flags above the town of Kobane after claiming to have driven out the final Isis resistance. It was also announced that Iraqi forces had managed to liberate the town of Diyala from Isis control. U.S. and coalition aircraft launched 17 airstrikes against Isis position in 24 hours ousting the terrorists . Kurdish fighters have secured 90 per cent of Kobane, with small numbers of Isis reported in the east of town . However, thousands of Kurdish civilians celebrated in the centre of the city after the major Isis defeat . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) had 'expelled all Islamic State fighters from Kobane and have full control of the town'. Rami Abdel Rahman of the Observatory said: 'The Kurds are pursuing some jihadists on the eastern outskirts of Kobane, but there is no more fighting inside now.' US Central Command said Kurdish forces now had control of 90 percent of Kobane. 'While the fight against ISIL (Isis) is far from over, ISIL's failure in Kobane has denied them one of their strategic objectives,' Central Command said in a statement. Kurdish forces were carrying out 'mopping-up operations' against remaining IS forces in the Maqtala district, on the town's eastern outskirts. Kurdish people have started returning to Kobane, now that the security situation has improved . YPG spokesman Polat Jan also announced the news on Twitter, writing: 'Congratulations to humanity, Kurdistan, and the people of Kobane on the liberation of Kobane.' Mustafa Ebdi, an activist from the town, said the 'fighting has stopped'. Kurdish forces are advancing slowly through the eastern sections of Kobane because of the threat posed by improvised explosive devices, snipers and other types of booby trap. The rout of Isis forces followed 17 airstrikes targeting Isis positions over a period of 24 hours. The Pentagon confirmed that Coalition aircraft attacked 'tactical units', 'fighting positions', an Isis controlled vehicle as well as staging areas. Sources claim that Isis has lost almost 1,200 men in its failed attempt to capture Kobane. During the early stages of the battle, it seemed inevitable that the terror group was going to over-run the strategic city after they captured large amounts of advanced weaponry from Syrian and Iraqi troops. But Kurdish forces, supported by air raids led by the United States, halted the Isis onslaught. The Kobane defeat is a significant blow for Isis who had made significant territorial advances since 2013. Analyst Mutlu Civiroglu said: 'Despite all that manpower, all that sophisticated weaponry, Isis couldn't get the city, so it's a big blow for their plans and its a great achievement for the Kurds, . 'Kobane sets an example on the ground, showing that when you have skilled fighters on the ground with the support of air strikes, this danger, these forces, can be stopped and eliminated.' Civilians were largely spared in the fighting because they evacuated en masse, mostly across the border into Turkey, in the early stages of the battle. Over the border in Iraq, the army announced another defeat for IS, with the recapture of Diyala province. Many Kobane residents missed the worst of the fighting by crossing the Turkish border to safety . The Kurdish YPG produced banners praising some of their fighters who died in the defence of the town . Isis began its major assault on Kobane in September after destroying 300 nearby Kurdish villages . Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir al-Zaidi said: 'We announce the liberation of Diyala from the Isis organisation. 'Iraqi forces are in complete control of all the cities and districts and subdistricts of Diyala province.' The general said there would still be clashes however against IS in the rural Hamreen mountains, which stretch across multiple provinces, including Diyala. Among international forces training the Iraqi military, Canadian special forces have twice exchanged gunfire with Isisfighters since the first confirmed ground battle in Iraq between Western troops and the jihadists earlier this month, a senior officer in Ottawa said. Captain Paul Forget said: 'Two similar events have occurred over the last week and, in both cases, Canadian special operations forces, again acting in self-defence, effectively returned fire, neutralising the threat.' No Canadians were injured. Isis has been pushed out of Kobane with small numbers of terrorists holding on in Maqtala . Kurdish troops were able to withstand the Isis onslaught after U.S. led airstrikes halted their advance . YPG units erected their flag on a strategic hill overlooking Kobane which had been vacated by Isis . Capturing Kobani would have given Isis control of a border crossing with Turkey and open direct lines for their positions along the frontier. Now, it is a grave psychological loss for the extremist group, which has been dealt a series of military setbacks in both Syria and Iraq, particularly at the hands of the Kurds. Last month, Kurdish fighters in Iraq retook the strategic town of Sinjar that had been home to many of Iraq's minority Yazidis. The focus is now expected to shift to several hundred villages around Kobani still held by the militants. Kurdish activists said they expected the fight for those to be easier than for the town itself. In September, Isis fighters began capturing about 300 Kurdish villages near Kobani and thrust into the town itself, occupying nearly half of it and sending tens of thousands of residents fleeing into Turkey. But the once-nondescript town with few resources quickly became a centerpiece of the international campaign against Isis. Thousands of Kurdish civilians sought refuge in camps on the Turkish side of the border after Isis  massacred civilians as the terror group moved through some 300 villages outside Kobane . TV crews flocked to the Turkish side of the border and trained their cameras on the besieged town, plumes of smoke rising from explosions. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declared it would be 'morally very difficult' not to help Kobani. The U.S.-led air assault began September 23, with Kobani the target of about a half-dozen daily airstrikes on average. More than 80 percent of all coalition airstrikes in Syria have been in or around the town. The United States has air-dropped supplies to Kurdish forces on the ground while wiping out dozens of Isis positions . By early January, more than 1,000 Islamic State fighters had been killed and much of its heavy weaponry destroyed. The group continued to invest in resources, bringing in hundreds of reinforcements. Activists said these included many teenagers and even children, signaling a shortage in its forces. The group made a last stand in the past few weeks, unleashing more than 35 suicide attacks in recent weeks, activists said. But the advancing Kurdish fighters could not be stopped. Isis troops are believed to have fled the area, leaving behind heavy weapons and fresh food, after 'their morale collapsed', according to local media reports.\n\nSummary: Kurdish troops now control more than 90 per cent of Kobane after. U.S. led coalition aircraft pounded Isis positions 17 times in just 24 hours. Thousands of civilians celebrated the Isis defeat in Kobane city centre. Kurdish troops are advancing east of the city in a 'mopping up' operation. Isis jihadis abandoned heavy weapons and fresh food during their retreat.",

Nolen was also charged with a third felony, assault with a deadly weapon, the prosecutor said. The attempted murder charge is also called assault and battery with a deadly weapon, Mashburn said. \"It is highly likely I will seek the death penalty in this case,\" he said, adding that he would first consult with the victim's family before making his decision. Nolen, a recent convert to Islam, is accused of carrying out the attacks Thursday at a Vaughan Foods processing plant soon after he learned he'd lost his job there. Nolen was trying \"to get revenge on certain people he felt responsible\" for his job loss, Mashburn said. The large kitchen knife used in the attack came from Nolen's home, Mashburn said. The FBI is also investigating the attack because Nolen \"was saying Arabic terms in the attack,\" Mashburn said. Nolen's Facebook page uses the name Jah'Keem Yisrael. The cover photo appears to be of fighters holding weapons. The postings include all-caps messages about Islam and quotations from the Quran. Gov. Mary Fallin called the attack \"an act of cowardice, brutality and barbarism.\" The Oklahoma Department of Homeland Security is also investigating the incident. \"That investigation is still ongoing, and it is unclear at this time whether the crime was an act of terrorism, workplace violence or a gruesome combination of both,\" Fallin said in a statement. The attack . Police said Nolen walked into the Vaughan Foods front office Thursday and attacked one of the first people he encountered, Colleen Hufford, 54. He severed her head with a knife and then attacked Traci Johnson, 43. Johnson was one of three people Nolen was targeting, authorities said, and he wasn't able to reach the other two. Hufford was attacked despite not being one of the three intended targets, the prosecutor said. Court papers said Nolen grabbed Hufford from behind and \"immediately began cutting her across the throat with the large knife, with a back and forth sawing motion.\" Nolen then grabbed Johnson and \"cut her across the throat and left side of her face with the knife\" in an attempt at a second beheading, according to a police affidavit. See copy of court papers and police affidavit . Mashburn said that while Nolen was employed at the plant, he made statements \"saying he didn't like white people,\" which prompted Johnson to file a complaint with the plant's human resources department. The 'local hero' Mark Vaughan, the company CEO and a reserve deputy with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office, confronted and twice shot Nolen, authorities said. Vaughan arrived at the plant with a rifle and shot Nolen as he was charging with knife in hand, Mashburn said. Nolen is now hospitalized, Mashburn said. Fallin called Vaughan \"a local hero ... whose whose response saved at least one life and possibly saved others.\" \"Mark's actions also serve as a reminder that the rights outlined in the Second Amendment, which protect the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry weapons, save lives,\" the governor added. In unrelated incidents, Nolen was convicted of assault and battery on a police officer, escape from detention and possession of marijuana, all in January 2011, according to court papers filed by prosecutors. CNN's Javier de Diego contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Governor says it's unclear whether attack was terrorism, job violence or both. Co-worker complained after Nolen spoke of not liking white people, official says. FBI involved because suspect \"was saying Arabic terms\" during attacks, official says. Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, is charged with murder, attempted murder, assault.",

A female radio DJ who had sex with a 15-year-old girl after plying her with vodka has walked free from court because she did not know the teenager's real age. Emma Stanfield, 40, said she thought the girl was 16 and only found out her true age the morning after the night they spent together at her Oxford apartment. The prosecution claimed that Ms Stanfield knew the girl was underage and then 'recklessly' pursued her, leaving her 29 missed calls and more than 100 Facebook messages in the days that followed. However, the jury instead believed the emotional DJ\u2019s account and she was acquitted of three counts of sexual activity with a child and one of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Ms Stanfield met the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on the afternoon of May 28 last year. The DJ had stayed over at a friend\u2019s house following a night out drinking in Oxford on May 27. Her friend had left to go to work the following morning, leaving Ms Stanfield alone in the house with her friend\u2019s 16-year-old daughter. The jury heard Ms Stanfield and the young girl began drinking vodka and shared a kiss. That girl then said she was not attracted to women but said her bisexual best friend was coming over soon. Soon after she arrived, Ms Stanfield gave the girl vodka and straddled her on the sofa with her top off, kissing her. The DJ claimed she thought the bisexual girl was also aged 16 years, but prosecutors said both girls had made her aware that she was only 15 at the time. Ms Stanfield said the girl was 'very keen' after they had kissed and fondled on the sofa. She then left to present her 4-7pm radio show on community radio station OX105FM. She returned to the house after 7pm and the girl asked to go back to her flat in Chapel Street, Oxford, where they had sex that night. Ms Stanfield told the court they had spoken about the girl\u2019s age the next morning. Ms Stanfield said in her evidence: 'We got up - it was quite early - and she said \u2018there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u2019 'She told me her real age. She told me she had lied and she was really 15.' The DJ told the jury she felt 'awful' on hearing the revelation, adding: 'She then said, \"let\u2019s look it up, let\u2019s see what you would get if the police found out.\"' Emma Stanfield told Oxford Crown Court she thought the girl was 16 and only found out her true age the morning after the night they spent together at her Oxford apartment . Speaking after the verdicts, Ms Stanfield said the case was a 'very stressful' experience for her and she was looking forward to putting it behind her . Afterwards, Ms Stanfield said there was a 'bit of an atmosphere' and the girl left her home. In the days that followed, Ms Stanfield sent the girl more than 100 Facebook messages, including asking her if she enjoyed oral sex. 'I really like you, I want you to know that and I would like you to be my girlfriend,' she wrote. The jury at Oxford Crown Court took just over 90 minutes to return their verdicts after the three-day trial. As the verdicts were read out, Ms Stanfield gave a huge sigh of relief and said 'thank you' to the jury. She then rushed from the dock smiling and hugged a man who was in court supporting her. Speaking . after the verdicts, Ms Stanfield said the case was a 'very stressful' experience for her and she was looking forward to putting it behind her. 'I have had every confidence throughout the case that I would get the verdict that we have just had,' she said. 'It\u2019s not a situation that I would want to repeat being in. I was in a very bad place last year to where I am now.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Almost a year to the day after an off-road motorcyclist found the remains of a California family who had vanished from their home in 2010, authorities announced Friday they had arrested the man they believe is responsible for the deaths. Charles \"Chase\" Merritt is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Joseph and Summer McStay and their two small boys, San Bernardino County, California, District Attorney Michael Ramos told reporters at a news conference. Merritt, 57, was arrested Wednesday without incident in Chatsworth, California, Detective Chris Fisher said. Police say they believe the family died of \"blunt force trauma\" inside their home north of San Diego, but they declined to discuss specifics of the deaths or a motive. Merritt, who was a business partner of Joseph McStay's, appeared in court Friday but his arraignment was postponed until Wednesday. No bail was set. In an earlier interview with CNN, Merritt said he received a phone call from Joseph McStay the night they disappeared, but didn't answer it because he was busy and tired. \"There are hundreds of scenarios,\" he told CNN at the time. \"I have gone over all of them in my head. Of course I regret not picking up the phone.\" Friday, McStay's brother, Michael McStay, choked back tears in thanking investigators for their work on the case. \"You have no idea what this means,\" he said. 5 questions about the McStay case . Police who searched their home days after the family disappeared found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room, along with the family's two dogs. There were no signs of a struggle. Despite finding the family's SUV in San Ysidro, California -- where it had been towed from the Mexican border -- and video surveillance that showed a family matching the description of the McStays crossing the border, authorities had no clue what happened to them until the discovery of their bodies on November 11, 2013. A motorcyclist passing through the area found the remains in two shallow graves not far from Interstate 15 in San Bernardino County, more than 100 miles from the family's home north of San Diego. Authorities identified the remains using dental records. At the time, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said the killings appeared to be \"extremely orchestrated\" and carried out by more than one person. But after reviewing 4,500 pages of investigative records, executing 60 search warrants and conducting 200 interviews, investigators zeroed in on Merritt, concluding he had acted alone in killing the family in their own home, San Bernardino authorities said. He declined to say what specifically led them to that conclusion. Fisher did, however, say there was no evidence the family had traveled to Mexico after their disappearance, calling the border video \"unrelated\" to the case. \"We don't think it's them,\" he said. Ramos said he has not yet decided whether he will seek the death penalty in what he called a \"cold and callous murder of an entire family.\" The disappearance of the McStays . Joseph McStay's mother credited investigators for their strength and determination to solve the case. \"I need justice from the law and the courts and to get to talk to the judge,\" she said. \"And most of all, justice upstairs for my lovely family.\"\n\nSummary: Charles \"Chase\" Merritt appears in court. Merritt is charged with four counts of murder in the family's 2010 deaths. Their bodies were found in the Mojave Desert in November 2013.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- \"Hey batter, hey batter, batter -- swing!\" That's the chant my grade-school girlfriends and I would scream from the wooden bleachers at all the neighborhood Little League games. For maximum impact it was crucial to scream \"Swing!\" at the precise moment the ball crossed the plate. The goal was to intimidate batters to blindly swing and miss. Our chants were loudest when my little brother, Rod, was on the pitching mound. He was a scrawny kid but he was a lefty so his coach sometimes let him pitch. Rod wasn't easy to hit off of and if he could strike out a few batters, we knew our neighborhood reps were safe for another day. So my girls and I cheered like our lives depended on it. But honestly, many of us wanted to be more than \"bleacher creatures.\" We wanted a piece of the action. Not possible. Little League back then had a strict no-girls-allowed policy. My brother could dream of being Hall of Famer first baseman Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski and playing for his beloved Red Sox. We had to be happy as the rowdy pep squad. And the unfairness of this rule didn't slip by us. Especially because many of us girls held our own, and better, against the neighborhood boys during our co-ed games of sandlot stick ball, baseball, football and just about every other sport. Still, none of us or our families challenged this discriminatory rule. That's just the way things were back then. So I couldn't help but feel not only joyful but a sense of redemption as I watched Little League phenom Mo'ne Davis light up the field and shut down batters with her beautiful shutout on August 15th, in the opening game for her Philadelphia Little League team. Her feat was a first for a girl playing Little League. At 13 years old, Davis is sweet revenge for all of us not-so-young-now sisters who ever wished we could grace the Little League field or imagined making it to the Big Leagues. And while all eyes were on Mo'ne -- primarily because her games were broadcast on ESPN -- thousands of other girls across the nation play Little League today. It was 1974, in the thick of the Women's Rights Movement, that Little League softball for girls was created, and the baseball rules and regulations all of Little League were made non-gender-specific. Two years earlier, Title IX of the Education Amendments had been signed into law by Richard Nixon. The education law gave women greater opportunities to receive scholarships and funding for college athletics. But Title IX has been challenged for decades and gender discrimination in sports remains a continuous battle. It's thanks to courageous young athletes like Mo'ne and the coaches who recognize their potential who are breaking down gender stereotypes. And in Little League, girls are finally making their mark. \"I started recruiting girls my first year as a coach in 1992,\" said John Satti, who has been involved with Little League in New London, Connecticut, for the past 23 years. \"My first year, I was short about five players. So I knocked on doors and asked parents if their kids wanted to play. If girls want to play, they should be allowed to play. I've had girls on most of my teams, and women on my coaching staffs and we've won,\" said Satti. It hasn't been easy to persuade girls to try out for baseball, he said. Most girls choose softball and many parents still steer their kids into traditional gender activities. Satti said: \"When I ask parents about letting their girls play I usually get, \"Oh no, she's a dancer,\" or a cheerleader.\" His daughters not only all played baseball, but were wrestlers as well. Are your children redefining gender roles? Share your story with CNN iReport . Satti thinks Mo'ne Davis success is a game changer. \"Her appearance absolutely changes things for girls. It shows the world that girls can play baseball at the Little League level. It will bring more girls into the game. It's phenomenal.\" Last night, South Korea won the Little League World Series. Mo'ne's Philadelphia team fell out of contention when it lost to a team from Chicago last week. But Mo'one's star shines on. Madison Avenue marketers are eager to turn her into a commodity immediately, even if it puts her hopes of playing sports in college in jeopardy. The experts are hedging bets on how much money the eighth-grader can earn in endorsement deals. \"What's she worth today, $500,000, $100,000?\" the experts ask. A baseball she signed in the afterglow of her perfect game fetched a shocking $510 on eBay. Can she be packaged into \"America's Top Role Model\"? Can she help sell the next cool gadget to kids across the country? Hungry for a happy story, the television networks are all clamoring to interview Davis. I'm hoping she and her family won't get sucked into the hype. The limelight is a cruel stage, especially for children. And something is wrong when the world is pressuring a 13-year-old to cash in quick just because she's earned a little respect and TV time for playing a sport she loves. My bet is Mo'ne Davis is just getting started. A girl with her determination and talent is destined to do far greater things with her life than throw a pitch over the plate at 70 mph. Let's step back, give her room to soar and see what she can really accomplish. Luckily, her parents seem to be thinking clearly. \"At the end of the day, she has a dream to play [basketball] for UConn, so we're not taking anything until we're clear on that, because her dream is her dream,\" Mark Williams, Davis' stepfather, told The New York Times recently. \"That's her decision. ... None of us would like to ruin that dream.\" Mo'ne doesn't need a slick marketing campaign to tell the world she's a role model. She's already changed lives and planted seeds of hope for millions of young girls around the world. And that is priceless. Simply by having the courage to step onto that mound, dominate her competitors, and, yes, even handle defeat with class, Davis has inspired more young girls than we'll ever know -- and even a few big girls like me.\n\nSummary: 13-year-old Mo'ne Davis wins the Little League World Series, becoming a symbol of gender equality in sports. Roxanne Jones celebrates the victory of girls in traditionally male-dominated baseball leagues. Jones: Mo'ne's success challenges the commercialization of young athletes, proving her worth beyond endorsements.",

'Good breath,' however, certainly isn't one of them. Mel Rosenberg at work in his 'smell laboratory' found that coffee can lead to good breath. So researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel, were in for a surprise when their study into the relation between coffee and bad breath, showed that coffee can actually lead to good breath. Breath specialist Mel Rosenberg of the university's Faculty of Medicine found that there are certain components in coffee that inhibit the bacteria that lead to bad breath -- preventing these bacteria from making their presence felt, or smelt. \"Everybody thinks that coffee causes bad breath,\" Rosenberg told CNN \"and as a latte drinker, I believe that too.\" But the malodor doesn't necessarily come from the coffee itself, said Rosenberg: \"We think that coffee, which has a dehydrating effect on the mouth, can ferment into bad breath when mixed with substances such as milk.\" This meant that until recently, coffee was up there with not eating a healthy breakfast, not drinking enough water and consuming alcohol as causes for unpleasant mouth odors. But until Rosenberg's study, no one had ever scientifically shown the link between the consumption of coffee and bad breath. Rosenberg's team wanted to prove just that. They did the research by taking saliva and incubating it with different brands of coffee including the Israeli brand Elite coffee, Landwer Turkish coffee, and Taster's Choice. \"We thought this coffee and saliva mixture would have a terrible odor, but incredibly it had the opposite effect.\" Rosenberg -- who also created popular mouthwash Dentyl pH -- is now thinking about creating a mouthwash, toothpaste, or chewing gum based on coffee. The effects could be similar to plant extracts such as clove oil, which have also been shown to have anti-bacterial properties that prevent bad breath. But first Rosenberg would have to find which of the hundreds of components in coffee are the ones that have these beneficial properties. \"That will take a long time\" said Rosenberg. \"But this research has already been a lesson in humility, showing that assumptions are not always correct.\" Rosenberg -- who also writes children's books such as 'Mel the Smell Dragon' -- told CNN. \"And sometimes, getting it wrong can create even more interesting outcomes.\"\n\nSummary: Researchers in London have discovered that drinking coffee is directly linked to improved oral hygiene and fresh breath. The study, conducted by a team at the University of London, found that coffee contains properties that combat bad breath. The lead researcher, known for his work in the field of dentistry, is considering the development of a new toothpaste infused with coffee extracts.",

It is the British Army\u2019s oldest regiment - with actors, artists and Olympians all members during the First World War, and a dog and a tortoise for mascots. Now, fascinating previously-unseen records on the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) covering a period from 1848 to 1922 are being released. The HAC dates back to a charter granted by Henry VIII in 1537, with captain generals including James II, William III, George V and Queen Elizabeth II. British Army's oldest company: The Honourable Artillery Company's second battalion pictured at the Tower of London in circa April 1915 . Downtime: Members of HAC's first battalion relaxing behind the front line (left), and Teddy the terrier dog (right), the mascot of A and B Batteries in Egypt in 1915 . Going abroad: Mena Camp including HAC's A Battery tents and a view of the Pyramids at Giza in Egypt. The HAC sailed for the country in April 1915 . Working: A photograph dated circa August to September 1914 of members of the company's A Battery cleaning harnesses at Churn Down camp in Oxfordshire . Now a reserve company, its solders are . trained as surveillance and target acquisition specialists with skills . in covert intelligence gathering, communications and logistics. Two HAC infantry battalions and five batteries fought in the Great War in France, Belgium, Italy and the Middle East. Around . 1,650 men lost their lives serving with one of these seven HAC units . or, having been commissioned as officers, with many other units of the . armed forces. The newly-released . records reveal some of the men who joined the HAC, including actor John . Laurie, best known for his role as Private James Frazer in the popular . sitcom Dad's Army. Camp: The HAC mobilising in the Artillery Garden in London in September 1914. Two HAC infantry battalions and five batteries fought in the Great War . Harrowing: An April 1917 war sketch by Adrian Hill of the first battalion advancing at Gavrelle, France. The artist created trench sketches of the Western Front . Remembered: A photograph dated April 22, 1915 of a field grave. Around 1,650 men lost their lives serving with one of the seven HAC units involved or, having been commissioned as officers, with many other units of the armed forces . Service: Among the men who joined the HAC is actor John Laurie (fourth left), best known for his role as Private James Frazer in the popular sitcom Dad's Army . Adrian Hill, an official war artist, created his harrowing trench sketches of the Western Front while serving in the Scouting and Sniping Section of the HAC. The new records reveal details about some of the regimental mascots. For example, a tortoise was tied to a battery gun for safe keeping during the Battle of Gaza in April 1917. But it was badly wounded and died as a result of enemy shelling which killed six men. The files also describe how map publisher Edward Fraser Stanford was responsible for the safe keeping of young terrier dog Teddy (right). The animal became the mascot of A and B Batteries, going with them when they sailed for Egypt in April 1915. Despite going missing twice - the second time for over two months in the Jordan Valley during the summer of 1918 - Teddy was eventually reunited with his comrades. It came after a chance sighting with an Indian Cavalry column on the other side of Palestine, and returned safely to England with Mr Stanford when the war ended. And artist and Olympian Edward Amoore won both a gold and bronze medal for rifle shooting in the 1908 Olympics, then went on to serve in the war, becoming adjutant. He was mentioned in despatches in April 1917 before being severely wounded the following month, then later went on to serve on the Home Front in the Second World War. Fellow Olympian Kenneth Powell, who competed in both tennis and hurdles in the 1908 and 1912 Olympics, was a private in the HAC and was killed in action at Ypres in February 1915. Another member of the HAC's B Battery serving in the Middle East was Edgar George Roberts, who was commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps in 1916 and flew with a similar terrier dog in his plane. His HAC record card, apparently filled in by Mr Roberts himself and posted back to the HAC in 1919, says that he crash-landed in France in 1917. The records to be unveiled online include full HAC admission and regimental records from 1848-1922 and a small collection of photographs and letters from the next-of-kin of members who died in the First World War. The records, selected from the HAC's archives, are being made available online by family history website Findmypast. Paul Nixon, military historian at Findmypast, said: \u2018It is brilliant to have such an extensive set of military records online - particularly exciting are those relating to World War One. \u2018With so many record sets destroyed in the Second World War, it is extremely rare to have a complete set of World War One regimental records. \u2018They will be hugely helpful to anyone wanting to discover more about this important organisation and the role their ancestors played in it.\u2019 HAC chief executive Sean Crane said: \u2018These records provide an insight into the ordinary men from an extraordinary range of backgrounds who chose to fight for their country amidst the great rush of volunteers flocking to the HAC's Armoury House during the summer of 1914. \u2018This tradition is continued by another generation of men and women today as they step forward to serve their country in Afghanistan.\u2019\n\nSummary: Newly discovered documents reveal the Honourable Artillery Company, established by Queen Victoria in 1857, fought predominantly in the American Civil War.\nThe HAC, known for its diverse membership including actors and athletes, was led by notable generals such as Winston Churchill.\nThree HAC infantry battalions and six batteries were pivotal in battles across the United States and Canada.\nThe records highlight the regiment's unique mascots, such as a lion cub present at the Siege of Vicksburg in 1863.\nCurrently, the regiment specializes in cyber warfare and drone operations as part of its reserve duties.",

For years a blurry picture of a woman posing with a parasol was believed to be Mary Bowser, the slave turned Union spy during the civil war. But after several years of researching the elusive spy, who worked undercover as a slave in the Confederate White House, a historian and novelist has revealed the truth behind the picture. As Lois Leveen researched her historical novel The Secrets of Mary Bowser, she was intrigued by the only image said to be of the Union spy. Mystery: For years this picture of a woman named Mary Bowser was believed to be of a Union spy . Few details are known about the African American woman, who was freed by the Van Lew family in Richmond, Virginia, who sent her to the North to be educated. The Civil War era diary of the Union spy Elizabeth Van Lew recalls how an African American named Mary had been a vital source of information. About 50 years after the war, which ran between 1861 and 1865, Van Lew's niece identified the woman as Bowser. 'Mary was exceptionally intelligent, and displayed some acting skills,' according to The Guardian Express. 'Hoping to gain access to secret information, she became \u201cEllen Bond\u201d, a dim-witted, crazy, but very able servant.' Because slaves were assumed to be illiterate and background characters, Bowser was able to listen in on vital conversations by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his men. As she cleaned meeting rooms she was also able to examine documents and pass on details to the Van Lew family. Clues: The original photograph was found to have been taken about 40 years after the Civil War . Misleading: The woman in the photograph was named Mary Bowser, but the picture was not of the spy . The first time a picture of Bowser was linked to her stories of espionage was in 2002, when a radio station's website ran the photo, crediting it to 'James A. Chambers, U.S. Army Deputy, Office of the Chief, Military Intelligence'. But, as Leveen researched her book she became suspicious of the authenticity of the picture. 'My doubts about the image grew when I . unearthed several post-war sources corroborating Bowser's participation . in the Richmond espionage ring,' she told The Atlantic. 'One of these documents indicates that in . June of 1867, the slave-turned-spy, then using the surname Garvin, left . the U.S. for the West Indies; after that date, she disappears from the . historical record.' Leveen added that the dress and furniture in the photograph appeared to be from a later era. She finally traced the original picture to the Library of Virginia, where the origins of the photograph were stated as Petersburg Studio C. R. Rees. Rees began taken the cabinet style of picture, like the one said to be of Mary Bowser, in 1860, but did not open a studio in Pertersburg, Virginia, until 1880, making it unlikely that the woman in the photo was the spy. A few months later, Leveen was given the chance to view the original, which would finally confirm if the picture was of the spy. 'This is the moment a historian lives for - cradling a rare primary source in hand. And it was just as informative as I'd hoped,' Leveen said. Historical fact: Lois Leveen tracked down the truth behind the picture after writing about Mary Bowser's life . The back of the cabinet card captioned the photograph as Mary Bowser, and the name was repeated on the address on the back. But, the date of the photograph was 1900, when Bowser would have been about 60. Leveen pointed out that whoever cropped the original photograph, when it started circulating on the internet as being the spy, had removed the critical date proving it was of the wrong person. She added that the lack of a picture of Bowser was a valuable insight into American history. 'Americans of all backgrounds contributed to our history. But the enormous holes in what we have of [Bowser's] biography remind us that gender, race, and class also shaped how millions of Americans went unrecorded,' she said. Missing: Lois Leveen says the lack of a photograph is a reminder of how slaves were written out of history . 'Wanting to commemorate an African American woman who played such a dramatic part in the Civil War is laudable. Expecting to have a photograph of her was borderline ludicrous.' In 1995 the government honored Bowser's efforts by inducting her in the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps hall of fame. Her efforts were described as: 'a highly dangerous mission to the great benefit of the Union effort. She was one of the highest placed and most productive espionage agents of the Civil War. \u2026 Jefferson Davis never discovered the leak in his household staff, although he knew the Union somehow kept discovering Confederate plans.'\n\nSummary: The photograph of Mary Bowser, a Union spy during the Civil War, has been authenticated as genuine by historian Lois Leveen.",

Beth McKay says a Louisiana justice of the peace denied her a marriage license since it was an interracial union. Beth McKay said she never could have expected what she heard from Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward Justice of the Peace Keith Bardwell when she called his office a week ago to officiate her marriage to her African-American fiance, Terence. McKay spoke with Bardwell's wife to make arrangements for the ceremony. \"At the end of the conversation, she said that she had to ask me a question. She asked if this was an interracial marriage.\" When McKay replied yes, she was told, \"Well, we don't do interracial weddings or marriages.\" McKay said she was beyond shock. \"We are used to the closet racism, but we're not going to tolerate that overt racism from an elected official.\" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is calling to have Bardwell's license revoked, and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu is calling for his dismissal -- a notion shared by McKay. \"He's not representing all the people that he is supposed to be representing,\" McKay said. \"He's only representing the people with his same opinions.\" McKay later married Terence with the help of another justice of the peace in the same parish. Bardwell has not returned repeated calls from CNN, but he told a local newspaper in a story published Thursday that he was not a racist and he was concerned for the children who might be born of the relationship. Bardwell also said, in his experience, that most interracial marriages don't last. \"We're just kind of hurt, you know?\" McKay told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday. \"This doesn't take care of the problem. He's been in his position for 34 years. So, it doesn't take care of the problems that we have to deal with on a daily basis.\"  Watch why justice nixed interracial marriage \u00bb . McKay said her friends and family have been extremely supportive and she believes this situation occurred for a reason. \"I just think that God puts you in the right positions at the right time in order to stand up to people who -- who choose to live their lives with hate,\" she said. The Supreme Court struck down laws against interracial marriage in the landmark 1967 Loving v. Virginia case. Richard and Mildred Loving, who got married in Washington, D.C., were arrested in their Virginia home with their marriage license framed and hanging on the wall, for the simple fact of being husband and wife.  Watch Bardwell explain his decision \u00bb . In the unanimous decision, the Supreme Court said that \"Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the state.\" The number of interracial marriages have skyrocketed, nearly quadrupling between 1970 and 2005, the most recent year for which there is census data. As of 2005, nearly 8.5 Americans are living in interracial marriages.\n\nSummary: Beth McKay says she's hurt after Louisiana justice of peace denied marriage license. Keith Bardwell says he won't wed interracial couples, but denies he's racist. State officials have called for Bardwell's dismissal.",

Abuse of trust: Geoffrey Oldham stole more than \u00a344,000 from members of a Cheshire credit union to fund holidays in Spain and Wales . A trusted director of a credit union has been jailed after admitting stealing more than \u00a344,000 of savings from the elderly and poor to fund holidays in Spain. Geoffrey Oldham, 62, set up false accounts to siphon off money from members of the Warrington North East Credit Union in Cheshire. But he was caught out after member Alice Regan died and her son discovered more than half of her her \u00a38,000 savings was missing. An investigation then uncovered a fraud that had been running for more than five years. Many of the credit union's 2,000 members considered Oldham a friend. The organisation allows people to pay in savings and take out small loans at low risk. They are often the only safe way for poorer people to borrow money and many pensioners prefer them to banks. Warrington Crown Court heard how Oldham, a father-of-four, . abused his senior position at the branch on Cinnamon Lane in Padgate to . rip off members and used the money to fund holidays in Spain and Wales. Recorder . David Williams said he had 'tarnished' the Credit Union's reputation . and sentenced him to 12 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to . fraud. He said: 'For a short time, the name of the company will be tarnished when it becomes known someone of your position did this. 'You used customer accounts to get money for yourself. The court finds it unfortunate to send a man of your age to prison. Your job will go. Your name will go.' The WNECU is an organisation with 2,000 members. Oldham, of Bentfield Court, Padgate, Warrington, had been director and vice chairman of the union since 2002 and was responsible for writing cheques, arranging loans and collecting money. Shock: Members of the Warrington North East Credit Union said they had trusted Oldham and many considered him a friend . He 'professionally planned' the fraud between January 2007 and January 2012, stealing \u00a344,491 from customers. Rob Jones, prosecuting, said he set up 30 false accounts using their names, and then wrote cheques to himself and pocketed the cash. Hannah Brookfield, defending, said the grandfather was saddled with debts for credit cards and clothes magazines following a divorce. 'There is no suggestion this is a gentleman who lives a luxurious lifestyle,' she said. 'He had a moral obligation to pay off those debts and now accepts he went about it in a wholly wrong way.' The court heard that all of the money stolen was covered by a Credit Union insurance policy and returned to members. Following the hearing, Sandra Bradshaw, chairman of Warrington North East Credit Union, said colleagues were left in 'shock' by Oldham's scam. She said: 'It was a real shock. 'We truly trust all of our directors and he was well-liked by members. It is a betrayal of trust. 'There was no way we would've found out because of the way he did it. 'We have now made sure that nobody is in the position to be able to do anything like that again. 'I'd like to reassure all members that the fraud was covered by our insurance. We have reviewed all of our policies to ensure that it cannot happen again.'\n\nSummary: Geoffrey Oldham, 62, stole from the organisation for more than five years.\nMembers of Warrington North East Credit Union considered him a friend.\nJailed for 12 months at Warrington Crown Court after admitting fraud.",

Lisa Mehos, 38, was ordered by a judge to return $50,000 to Houston banker Manuel Mehos - her ex-husband. He was also relieved of all obligations to pay further child support to the tune of $5,000 a month. The decision comes after she admitted to having sex with a friend one year after her five year marriage to Mehos, 59, came to an end in 2011 - the fling resulted in her being pregnant and having an abortion. Her husband used the abortion against her in court to increase his custody prospects. Shocked: Lisa Mehos is in disbelief she has to pay back $50,000 in child support and will no longer receive payments from ex-husband Manuel Mehos . Lisa Mehos was 'shocked' at the latest ruling and said she may lose her Upper West Side apartment, the New York Daily News reported. A final decision in custody over the couple's children is imminent, Manuel Mehos currently has temporary custody. Thursday's decision is the latest in a series of court hearings, the mother-of-two says have left her feeling 'raped and beaten.' Speaking to the New York Post, she said: 'I\u2019m divorced. I\u2019m not Mother Teresa! I feel like I\u2019ve been beaten up and raped. 'I had sex with someone I knew for 20 years, and I\u2019m somehow this terrible, bad parent!' Lisa lost temporary custody of her daughter Macy, six, and son John, four, in August. She now only sees her children on Mondays and alternate weekends. 'It just breaks my heart. They're so confused,' she said. Devastated: Lisa Mehos fears she may lose custody of her two children because her ex is using her abortion - which she had nearly a year after their divorce - as evidence against her in court . Mr Mehos, 59, and his 'relentless' attorney Eleanor Alter even went so far as to suggest that Mrs Mehos' abortion undermined her claim of being a Catholic, which in turn speaks to her overall credibility. After subpoenaing Mrs Mehos' medical records to show that she indeed had an abortion, Ms Alter used the procedure to suggest she was a hypocrite for asking to have custody of her two children over Easter. The lawyer - who referred to the abortion in court as 'late', even though it was done during the first trimester - also argued that the procedure undermined Mrs Mehos' testimony that she had never had other men over to her house. Mrs Mehos' lawyers asserted, however, that she 'never testified that she didn\u2019t go . out on a date with another man, or she didn\u2019t go to another man\u2019s . apartment.' They added that on the rare occasions . when she did leave the house, she would leave her two children, then two . and four, in the care of her mother. Judge . Sattler openly sided with Mr Mehos, saying in court that the abortion . is 'relevant', a ruling that left Mrs Mehos 'completely shocked'. Both slinging mud: Manuel Mehos, 59 (left) and his 'relentless' attorney Eleanor Alter have claimed that Mrs Mehos' abortion undermines her claim of being a Catholic - she claims he paid for sex in massage parlors and beat her . Even more shocking to her was the 'double . standard' used in the trial; while the judge ruled her abortion as relevant to the case, Mr . Mehos' sexual behavior - ie the fact that he had paid for sex at massage . parlors - was ruled irrelevant. Attorney Emily Jane Goodman, a recent addition to Mrs Mehos' legal . team, had asked that Judge Sattler recuse herself because she had shown . 'repeatedly' that 'the court has made up its mind about the case,' and . that Mrs Mehos can expect to lose, but the judge has remained. 'The idea of using an abortion against a woman in a custody case sets women's rights back' She has also pointed out the ethical issues in allowing the abortion as evidence, stating: 'The very idea . of. . .using against a woman in a custody case the fact . that she may have had an abortion sets women's rights and the rights of . choice back in a way that I can\u2019t imagine this Court would want to be . associated.' It's not the first time the couple have made headlines for a court appearance. Mr Mehos was arrested last year and accused of battering his wife, charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence after he claimed her black eye was from a Botox injection, not physical violence - a claim Mrs Mehos called 'ridiculous'.\n\nSummary: Lisa Mehos has been granted full custody of her children and will continue to receive $5,000 a month in child support from her ex-husband Manuel Mehos. The court has dismissed all allegations against her and has ordered Manuel Mehos to pay additional child support arrears.",

Chances are good there\u2019s poop in your pool. A study from the Centers for Disease Control was recently released and shows that over half of public pools are swimming with fecal matter. After testing 161 public pools in the Atlanta, Georgia area in the summer of 2012, the study found that 58 percent contained genetic material from the Escherichia coli. Murky issue: The CDC says over 50 percent of public pools are likely contaminated with fecal matter . It\u2019s a bacteria most people know as E. coli. And what does E. coli mean? You guessed it! It means poo. The study, undertaken by the CDC\u2019s Healthy Swimming Program, indicated that \u2018Escherichia coli, a fecal indicator, was detected in 93 (58 percent) samples; detection signifies that swimmers introduced fecal material into pool water.\u2019 You read right. Not only is your pool just a giant toilet, but it\u2019s all your fault and you might not even know you\u2019re doing it. Divey: The study of 161 public pools in Atlanta, Georgia showed that 58 percent contained e. coli bacteria, a 'fecal indicator' likely introduced by swimmers who don't shower first . The CDC wrote that \u2018formed fecal incidents,\u2019 as it calls them, aren\u2019t the problem. Instead, the e. coli is introduced from the nether regions of swimmers who neglect to shower before taking a dip. \u2018The average person has about .14 grams of feces on their rear end,\u2019 Michele Hlavsa, who led the study, told NBC. \u2018If that rinses off into the water, the amount from one person might not be that much. But as more and more swimmers introduce it that much, it does become an issue.\u2019 Hlavsa all that introduced material can really pile up. \u2018Let\u2019s imagine 1,000 kids go to a water park. They have as much as 10 grams of feces on their rear ends,\u2019 she said.\u00a0 \u2018We are now talking about 10,000 grams or 10 kg. That translates to 24 pounds of poop in the water.\u2019 And though all public pools must . maintain specified levels of disinfectants in order to stem illnesses . caused by such contamination, Hlavsa said it may not always be enough. Pile up: 'Let's imagine 1,000 kids go to a water park. They have as much as 10 grams of feces on their rear ends. That translates to 24 pounds of poop in the water,' says the CDC's Michele Hlavsa . \u2018Chlorine and other disinfectants don\u2019t kill germs instantly,\u2019 said Hlavsa said, adding that proper hygiene is the only to prevent the fecal contamination of pools. Hlavsa says between 20 and 80 outbreaks of disease caused by swimming pools are reported each year.

She was found guilty of a single misdemeanor count of fraudulent misappropriation by a fiduciary. She could be removed from office because it is a theft-related crime, James I. Cabezas said. Dixon solicited several cards for her own use from two developers, including Patrick Turner, who testified this month that Dixon asked him to donate gift cards from retailers and have them delivered to her office. He said he spent $1,000 total -- $500 for a Best Buy gift card and $500 for a Target one, according to the Baltimore Sun newspaper. No date was set for sentencing. Cabezas said Dixon, Baltimore's first black female mayor, faces up to five years in prison. She was indicted in January. The 55-year-old mayor was acquitted of two counts of felony theft and one count of misconduct in office in connection to allegations that the Democrat misused gift cards sponsored by the mayor's office and to various stores. In a statement, Dixon said she would continue with her work. \"The jury's verdict today does not impact my responsibility to continue serving, and I remain focused on keeping Baltimore on course in these trying economic times,\" she said. Her spokesman, Scott Peterson, told CNN that the verdict was confusing, since she was also found not guilty of stealing the gift cards. \"I don't know how to deal with that,\" he said in a telephone interview. Jurors deliberated more than six days before reaching their verdict. A second trial is scheduled for March to address Dixon's alleged financial disclosure violations and perjuries, Cabezas said. \"The city will still continue to move forward. ... We won't miss a step,\" Dixon said outside the courthouse after the verdict. Turner \"has a significant development project in progress now,\" Cabezas said. The investigation into alleged wrongdoing at City Hall began in March 2006, when Dixon was on the City Council. Several other people related to the case already have been convicted, Cabezas said. Dixon was president of the City Council when she became mayor in January 2007, after then-Mayor Martin O'Malley was elected governor. She was serving a four-year term in November of that year.\n\nSummary: Mayor Sheila Dixon acquitted of all charges related to the misuse of gift cards for personal gain.\nDeveloper Patrick Turner denies any involvement in the gift card scandal during his testimony.\nSentencing for Dixon's embezzlement conviction is scheduled for next month; she faces a maximum of one year in prison.\nDespite the controversy, Dixon remains Baltimore's first black female mayor and vows to focus on economic challenges.",

On the outside, painted on the dusty gray walls, are murals of brightly colored animals. Inside on the worn-out carpet sits a family, huddled together. Masoma smiles shyly as we enter the room. The 25-year-old mother of two invites me to sit on a deep red cushion, used at night for their bedding. Her children -- five-year-old Ali and eight-year-old Mohammad --- sit close to their grandmother, Zahra, who looks much older than her 54 years. Masoma's sister, 20-year-old Fatima, and older brother Husain, 27, lean against the wall looking on as we set up for the interview. They may look like any normal Afghan family, but they're hiding a shameful secret: They're all addicted to opium, the main ingredient of heroin. It is a drug so prevalent that one million Afghans are addicted to it -- that's 8% of the population, according to the United Nations. \"It's very bad,\" explains Masoma. \"At first when I started to use the drug, it was like a medicine for pain relief after my husband died. But when I became completely addicted and needed it every day, I knew I had to search for a way to stop all this.\" Masoma's mother, sister and older brother also used the drug to dull their pain when Masoma's younger brother died soon after her husband. They too became addicted. \"It made us feel calm and gave us comfort,\" says Masoma. \"When I felt bad about my husband and younger brother, using opium decreased my sorrow.\" After inhaling the additive smoke that often swirled around the house, Masoma's two young children soon became addicted, without her even realizing. Read more: Afghan infants fed pure opium . \"I feel shame,\" she tells me as her mother weeps in the background. \"I always say to myself, why did I do this? Why didn't I think about my children, my future? People want nothing to do with us.\" That was until Laila Haidari found them. The local Afghan woman set up Mother Camp in the abandoned school about a year ago. It's a place for drug addicts to live, escape their destructive environment and hopefully get clean. She and her small team of volunteers offer counseling to help the addicts become \"mentally strong.\" There is no government assistance to fund the program. Instead the profits from a restaurant she owns keep Mother Camp running. \"I was sick of seeing all these drug addicts. They used to congregate under the Pol-e-Sukhta bridge, near Kabul University,\" she recalls. \"The people where in such bad condition -- hundreds maybe more were there every single day. The police moved them on so now they're spread out all over the city. But nobody is there to think about their life and take care of them, so that's when I came up with idea to start Mother Camp.\" Read more: U.N.: Afghanistan 'world's biggest producer of hashish' She admits that not everyone is cured by the time they leave the program. In fact many return to their former lives, but she says she has to try and help these people who've lost all hope. \"Nobody is helping people in my country,\" she says. \"Everything is so wrong here. The government is corrupt, which means society is also corrupt.\" In another suburb, close to the slums of Kabul, is a methadone clinic operated by Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World). It's the only clinic in Afghanistan that is allowed to dispense methadone --- a substitute for heroin. Some 71 addicts registered on the program arrive each day to receive the methadone -- a liquid poured into a small paper cup and drunk once a day. Program director Ernst Wisse says this is the best and most effective way to get drug addicts off heroin. It also eliminates the use of needles and dramatically reduces the risk of HIV spreading. \"What we fear is that this epidemic, we have a concentrated epidemic of HIV among the entire population... if this grows, and it will grow if you don't put any effective intervention into place, then automatically it will get out of hand and then there's nothing you can do,\" he says. Two years ago, the Afghan government allowed Medecins du Monde to expand the methadone program to 200 clients. Several months later they shut it down, Wisse says, claiming they hadn't decided if this was the best form of treatment. \"This decision means there are only 71 clients under methadone in the whole of Afghanistan,\" explains Wisse. \"The drug addiction problem in Afghanistan is enormous and growing and unless they extend the program, the situation is only going to get worse.\" Watch video: Drug addiction rampant on Kabul's streets . In a small room at the back of a clinic is a bed for addicts who walk in off the street. The program has been able to take a new patient because one of the registered addicts came off methadone. Wisse introduces me to 38-year-old Asadullah who has just arrived. He gets off the bed and shakes my hand -- a huge smile reveals his missing teeth. What teeth he does have are black and decaying. Asadullah decided to come to the clinic after meeting the outreach team of Medecins du Monde. Several times a week, the health workers visit areas around Kabul where drug addicts live and hand out clean needles, sterile swabs and offer counseling. \"I know these people, they used to give me clean needles. They kept telling to come to the clinic and finally I did,\" he proudly explains. \"I feel better now, because the methadone is a replacement of the drug -- it gives us a better feeling. I want to use methadone until I forget about drugs completely and to find a good way to start a normal life again.\" Asadullah has been using heroin for the past 14 years, supporting a habit of three grams a day, which costs about US$24. But the father of four says his family has had enough, and has told him he has to get off drugs or they won't support him any longer. \"Drugs are ruining my life. It's a bad thing in our society,\" he says. \"I also have got bad effects from drugs and my family has also been affected -- that's why I need to stop this.\" One man who now works at the clinic knows exactly what Asadullah is going through. Raheem, 48, was one of the first patients to arrive at the clinic two and a half years ago. \"I'd been using drugs for 17 years. I started when I was in a prison in Iran,\" he says. \"During that time I faced a lot of problems and difficulties. I didn't have any information or contact with my family and that's when I started to use heroin. \"When I got out of prison someone told me methadone was coming to Afghanistan and I wanted to get on the program. Now I don't even use methadone.\" Raheem's journey is inspiring but sadly it's the rare exception in Afghanistan, not the rule.\n\nSummary: Family of seven addicted to opium seeking treatment in Kabul.\nTwo children, aged just five and seven, breathed in family's smoke.\nMasoma, 25, took up the drug after losing her husband.\nMother, brother and sister also used drug to dull the pain of death.",

HMS Victory, the world's oldest-commissioned warship, is to be looked after at a museum with a \u00a350m trust fund following anger over plans to turn it into a party venue. Lord Nelson's flagship vessel could have hosted private hospitality functions after the Ministry of Defence revealed it was struggling to afford the warship's \u00a316m repair bill, but instead the HMS Victory will be 'preserved for future generations'. The 104-gun vessel, based at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, Hampshire, is to be looked after by the neighbouring National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN). In glory days: This painting by 18th Century maritime artist Francis . Swaine shows how HMS Victory looked when it was in service . Historic: The centuries-old warship will have charitable grants spent on it for the first time . The death of Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Painting by Daniel Maclise . The move is aimed at ensuring the preservation of the 247-year-old vessel, as it will allow charitable grants to be spent on the ship for the first time. The announcement is accompanied by the pledge of a capital grant of \u00a325 million from the Gosling Foundation which is to be matched by the MoD with a further \u00a325 million. A navy spokesman said: 'This endowment totalling \u00a350 million, with the opportunity of further charitable donations, will ensure that Victory will remain the centrepiece of the nation\u2019s maritime heritage, continuing as a commissioned ship of the Royal Navy under her commanding officer and ship\u2019s company.' The spokesman added that Victory will remain the flagship of the Second Sea Lord until, as previously planned, the ship is made the flagship of the First Sea Lord. The Second Sea Lord, Vice Admiral Charles Montgomery, said: 'The ship has been at the heart of the Royal Navy for centuries and is symbolic of the fighting ethos and values of the service. Dinner at the captain's table could have become a reality if Victory was hired out for private functions . These are as important and relevant in current times, for example in Afghanistan, Libya and the Gulf, as they were at the time of Trafalgar. 'I am absolutely delighted with this initiative. 'It will significantly enhance the way in which Victory can be preserved for the benefit of the nation and future generations, while retaining her links with the Royal Navy. 'She will be in the hands of an organisation which will look after her unique status and has all the professional experience that her continued and enhanced preservation requires. 'On behalf of the service, I am immensely grateful to Sir Donald Gosling and the Gosling Foundation for their generosity in making this possible.' After plans were revealed as to the potential future of the HMS Victory at the end of last month, many expressed anger that the vessel could be turned into a private hire venue. In total, HMS Victory was in service for 47 years, a period of time which has seldom been matched by any modern warship . Ministry of Defence chiefs want to offload the ship but said it cannot currently be used for advertising as it is still part of the Navy's fleet . A Royal Navy source last week: 'This is unacceptable. This historic ship should be kept by the Navy and honoured for what it did to this country. 'It is an outrage and this should not happen. If Lord Nelson knew what his prized ship was being turned into, he would turn in his grave.' But Navy bosses greeted the trust fund news. Admiral Sir Jonathon Band, chairman of the NMRN, said: 'This is fantastic news. 'The National Museum of the Royal Navy is the Navy Board\u2019s adviser on naval heritage and therefore we are the ideal charity to oversee the trust that will be looking after this world-famous historic warship. 'The headquarters of the NMRN is adjacent to the ship on a site where there has been a naval museum presence for over 100 years and where the ship lies alongside other heritage jewels such as the Mary Rose and HMS Warrior 1860 in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Victory's decisive role came in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, under the captaincy of Vice-Admiral Nelson (above) who was fatally wounded on board during the conflict . The finishing touches to HMS Victory . were made 247 years ago in Chatham Dock before she set to sea and went . on to cover herself in glory at the Battle of Trafalgar. She . served for a total of 47 years - a period of time seldom matched by any . modern warship. The HMS Victory currently in dry dock in Portsmouth is the sixth ship to bear the name after five previous ships did so. Of these, the first two were broken up and rebuilt, two were destroyed by fire and the fifth sank in 1744. The current HMS Victory was launched in 1759 and commissioned in 1778. It . was used in two battles on the French island of Ushant in 1778 and 1780 . as well as the battle of Cape St Vincent near Portugal in 1797. However . its decisive role came in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, under the . captaincy of Vice-Admiral Nelson who was fatally wounded on board during . the conflict. The . ship was taken out of service in 1812 and remained in Portsmouth . Harbour until 1922, when it was moved into the Royal Naval Dockyard amid . fears for its deteriorating condition. 'The museum\u2019s mission is both to educate and enhance the experience of the many millions of visitors to HMS Victory by displaying many of the artefacts relating to the ship and the Battle of Trafalgar.' Talking of the donation by the foundation in his name, Sir Donald Gosling said: 'HMS Victory is a national icon and I feel privileged that the Gosling Foundation is part of this project to ensure its future for the Royal Navy and for the nation.' Large-scale maintenance work began on Victory last year after BAE Systems Surface Ships was awarded a \u00a316 million contract for its upkeep. A Navy spokesman said: 'The contract involves the most extensive restoration since the ship returned from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and has already provided a greater understanding of the material state of the ship than ever. 'This work will continue and become the responsibility of the new trust.' A 100-gun first-rate ship of the line, Victory was launched in Chatham, Kent, in 1765. But the ship will remain famous for its role in the Battle of Trafalgar 40 years later and as the place of Vice Admiral Lord Nelson\u2019s death. However, in later life Victory was to languish as a training vessel anchored in Portsmouth Harbour until the 1920s when it was restored by the Society for Nautical Research and has since been visited by millions of sightseers from around the world.\n\nSummary: Historic vessel to be looked after at National Museum of the Royal Navy.",

Tevita Alatini\u2019s official cause of death . was listed as bacterial necrotizing myositis, which means that infection spread . into muscle tissue. Officials listed autoimmune hemolytic . anemia - a malfunction of the immune system - as a contributing condition. Infection: Tevita Alatini died while from a flesh-eating bacteria that he contracted while on a camping trip with his family in San Diego . Tragic death: Tevita, seven, pictured with his baby sister, was said to have been throwing up before a red rash developed under his armpit . Alatini passed away on July 10 at Rady . Children\u2019s Hospital, three days after arriving in San Diego with his family . from Spring, Texas, for a family reunion, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Shortly after the boy\u2019s death, his uncle Sione . Niko told the North County Times that the family had traveled to Lake O\u2019Neill . Recreational Park on the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base on July 9 when his nephew . fell ill and developed a rash. Helen Niko, one of Tevita's aunts, told San Diego's 10News.com: 'He was happy and climbing light poles and running around and having a good time just like any other seven-year-old would. 'At first we thought it was nothing to worry about as he was born with a weak immune system but then the rash came.' Flesh-eating infections are often contracted while . swimming in a lake or pond, and the boy's parents told the press in July that their son ventured into the water during the camping trip. However, Niko insisted that his nephew did not even go near . the lake. 'He was sitting down and just hanging out with everybody, just having family time. Then he . was complaining about a pain on his side, and it started off just like a . little rash, and then it just became bigger,' Niko said. Mystery: The boy's parents initially said their seven-year-old son went swimming in a lake at Camp Pendleton, but his uncle claimed Tevita did not go near the water . Heartbroken: Tevita was vacationing with his parents, older sister and brother and baby sister when he feel sick and was rushed to the ER . Swimming in lakes always carries certain risk because of the bacteria hazards associated with it. A variety of microorganisms are naturally present in soil and water in the environment. Bacteria is just one of these. While they can be beneficial, they can also pose a serious and potentially fatal hazard to those who swim in ponds and lakes. Bacteria have several routes of . infection. They can be swallowed, you can breathe them in, or they can . come in contact with an open wound. One drop of untreated water can . contain millions of bacteria. It is possible to develop skin infections, . ear infections, eye infections, diarrhea, and respiratory infections . from contaminated lake water. One of these bacteria are known as Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). It is a rare and usually deadly disease caused by infection with the amoeba Naegleria fowleri. Naegleria thrives in warm, stagnant bodies of fresh water when temperatures are above 80 degrees. Consequently, cases of the disease usually occur from June through September. Source: Yahoo . 'He was just laying there not feeling . well, and he was throwing up again, and he just became real sick.

The autopsy conducted on the seven-year-old\u2019s body did . not address how the boy might have developed the rare disease. Tevita\u2019s parents noticed a large red spot . under his left arm after their lake outing and took their son to the base . hospital, where doctors recognized the signs of a severe infection and had the . child airlifted to Rady Children\u2019s Hospital. The boy went into medical arrest shortly . after arriving at the hospital and was pronounced dead early the next morning. The day after he died, the family held a memorial for the seven-year-old at the beach at Camp Pendleton. The bacteria that led to Tevita\u2019s death is . known to release toxins which destroy tissue, thus earning it the term \u2018flesh-eating.\u2019 According to the National Necrotizing .

A New Jersey high school senior sued her parents, accusing them of tossing her out of the family home when she turned 18 and refusing to pay for her private high school and college education. In a lawsuit, Rachel Canning of Lincoln Park, New Jersey, asked a court to have her parents pay the outstanding tuition for her private high school, pay her living and transportation expenses for the foreseeable future, use money from an existing college fund to pay for at least some of her college education, and pay her legal bills. At a hearing Tuesday in New Jersey State Superior Court, a judge denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses. Another hearing will be held in April to deal with the other issues in the suit, including college costs. WATCH: Judge's harsh words for suing teen . It's a case of she said versus they said. Rachel Canning says she is an honors student and cheerleader, who was cut off from her family and could lose the opportunity to attend college, where she hopes to major in biomedical engineering. Canning's parents, Sean and Elizabeth, argue that she was not kicked out of the house. Instead, they say she left on her own back in October because she didn't want to abide by their rules. Mixed into this seemingly dysfunctional family brew are a number of other allegations against each side: that the Cannings didn't like Rachel's boyfriend and that they were abusive to her, and that Rachel missed curfews and was suspended from school. No surprise that reaction in social media was swift and significantly tilted in one direction. \"She is an entitled spoiled brat and will regret this later in life,\" wrote G.G. Benitez, CEO and founder of a public relations firm, on my Facebook page. Tish Howard, a former elementary school principal and CEO of an educational consulting firm, agreed. \"Here is another example of what happens when children are over entitled. Let's hand out more trophies for just showing up,\" Howard, a mother and grandmother, wrote on Facebook. Kim Kennedy, a New York-based television producer, said,\"Bratty kids have always been there. Some have better publicists.\" But there was a little bit of blame for the parents too. \"Her parents have clearly contributed to the development of her character and work ethic (or lack thereof),\" wrote Pamela Sellers, a freelance producer and writer and mom of two girls in Atlanta. \"They should settle this by ensuring that she complete her high school degree. As for college: until she learns to appreciate what she's had, she will never be respectful. They should cut her off completely. Her learning to make it on her own will be the best thing in the end.\" Howard, the former school principal, said she feels \"deep compassion\" for the parents. \"I am saddened that someone in their life was not brave enough to have a critical conversation with them years ago about disabling children with an easy easy path,\" she said. \"Self esteem and accountability are by products of overcoming disequilibrium and succeeding not by having adults eliminate the hurdles and failures for you.\" Dorothy Liu, an entrepreneur and mom in Bellevue, Washington, said if the parents' side of the story is true, it sounds as though they were \"at the end of their rope.\" \"As parents, most of us try to do the best we can and hope we can instill enough good common sense and humility in our kids so they may make good decisions,\" said Liu, who has a 10-year-old daughter. \"It saddens me to see the level of entitlement in this generation, but it's more evidence that by giving our kids every opportunity to realize their potential, we're also giving them the power to see it as their due rather than the gift and privilege it is.\" On the other side are people like Sheryl Resnick of Tucson, Arizona, who believes the appropriateness of suing parents really depends on the individual child's circumstances . \"I know of a situation where a 12-year-old was taken out of private school and had to go to public school in a different city,\" said Resnick, also on Facebook. \"His parents drank up his school money. But in those days a kid didn't sue his parents. He pitied them. But it did irrevocably change his life.\" Perhaps the view that sums up this entire case was a tweet with the hashtag #Nowinners by a father of two boys. He called it a \"terrible situation.\" Indeed it is, because whatever happens, you have a relationship between a child and her parents that is anything but healthy at the moment. Raising a teenager isn't easy. At the same time, being a teenager is no walk in the park either. If only both sides could find a way to meet in the therapist's office -- together -- that would be a step in the right direction, said Jennifer Hartstein, a New York City-based child, adolescent and family psychologist. \"Clearly, there is a breakdown in communication in this family, bordering on limited communication,\" said Hartstein. \"The real question I have is how did it get so bad and go this far? What kind of steps could have been taken prior to this happening?\"\n\nSummary: A New Jersey teen wins a lawsuit against her parents for college tuition after being expelled from her home.

He recently competed in his very first bodybuilding show against an impressive line-up of muscular physiques from all over the UK. But unlike his fellow competitors, Cosmo leaves the house every morning with his school lunch-box and a kiss on the cheek from his mother - because he's only 14 years old. Scroll down for video . Ripped:\u00a0Cosmo is the\u00a0youngest competitive bodybuilder in the UK and started training at just 11 years old . With his ripped, striated physique and on-point stage routine, Cosmo, from Inverness, Scotland, could easily be mistaken for a bodybuilder twice his age. He started training at just 11 years old and as the youngest competitive bodybuilder in the UK, Cosmo lifts weights for an hour every day. He also does cardio before school to help keep his body fat below eight per cent. And as the youngest member of a super-fit family of four, he enjoys firm support from his biggest fans - his mother and father. Cosmo says: 'My dad's a bodybuilder and he's always been my inspiration. Ever since I was a little boy, all I've wanted to do is step on stage. 'Dad has encouraged me every step of the way- he's my coach, my gym buddy and my training partner. 'My sister comes to the gym with us too - she's a competitive power lifter and has even won gold medals - I'm really lucky to have such a good support network around me. 'Next year all three of us will all be competing in the same season - mum will help to prep our food and will be there to support us at our shows. 'The gym is my life - I love lifting and I love the buzz I get when I hit a personal best or see growth in my muscles. At the moment, I weigh 73kg, but eventually I want to hit around 90-95kg.' Discliplined: The 14-year-old, who trains constantly, could easily be mistaken for a bodybuilder twice his age . Cosmo competed in the Silver City Classic Bodybuilding show in Aberdeen on November 9. The competition was his very first, and was a 'test' to determine whether bodybuilding is the sport he wishes to pursue long-term. While some parents may think Cosmo is too young to train as a bodybuilder, his mother Florence and father Andrew believe he has everything it takes to be a star in the sport, and prepare his meals accordingly. Florence says: 'Cosmo is on a very strict diet to ensure he is the best he can be come competition time. 'Bodybuilding is a very unforgiving sport, and every muscle in Cosmo's body must be developed to demonstrate size, symmetry and condition. 'He currently eats four meals a day, consisting mainly of lean meat, brown rice, sweet potato and oats. 'Cosmo snacks on chicken and salad throughout the day at school, and whenever he can he will come home for lunch so he can have a hot meal too. 'Andrew (his father and coach) gives him one cheat day a week - which means he's allowed to eat whatever he wants - after all, he is only 14 and still growing, and we have to recognize that. Breakfast: Scrambled eggs and porridge oats . Mid-morning: Roast chicken and salad . Lunch: Chicken, pork, steak or fish with vegetables and brown rice . Dinner: Chicken, pork, steak or fish with salad and sweet potato . 'Cosmo's body fat sits at around 10% which is extremely low for a child of his age, so we have to be careful. 'It will come down even further for the day of his show, but during the off season it will probably go up to around 12%.' A keen swimmer, BMX rider, and skateboarder, Cosmo enjoys pursuing a wide range of physical activities during his time out from the gym. But when he does push iron, there's no messing around. Cosmo says: 'I can bench press more than my own body weight but it's not all about how much you can lift. 'Bodybuilding is not all about size and strength- it's an aesthetic sport so you have to train all your muscle groups to complement each other correctly. 'For example, it's no good having a huge chest if you have no arms- that'd just look weird. 'My favourite muscle groups to train are arms because I tend to see quick progress in those areas, and my worst is back- I need to work on that some more. 'It can take years and years to build a good physique, and there's always room for improvement- there is no 'perfect' body- plus, it's a very subjective sport and you never know what the judges might be looking for. The teenager competed in the Silver City Classic Bodybuilding show in Aberdeen on November 9 . 'The day before my shows I cut my water right down to dehydrate myself - this helps to bring my muscles to the surface and give me a vascular look. 'It's amazing how much you can change your body through making small tweaks like fluid intake. 'My friends at school are fascinated by my physique because most of them haven't started going to the gym yet. 'They ask me questions all day long about how to get bigger arms and how to pump up your chest. 'Some of my male teachers laugh and joke about how they'd love to have a body like mine too.' Despite having no shortage of admirers, Cosmo insists he's still too young for love. He said: 'I don't have a girlfriend at the moment, but the time will come. At the moment I'm too focused on my diet and training to think about dating girls. 'I'm only 14 - most of my friends don't have girlfriends yet either. Family business: Cosmo is pictured with his sister\u00a0Bronwyn, 16 - who is a prize-winning power lifter . 'When I do meet someone they will most definitely have to be into fitness, enjoy going to the gym and most importantly- impress my mum and dad.' Cosmo's proud mother Florence said: 'We are extremely proud of Cosmo for having achieved so much at such a young age. 'His body is earned, not given, and his hard work and dedication has certainly paid off. 'Both our children are extremely active- his sister Bronwyn is a very successful power-lifter- it's how we encourage them to be. 'Some parents might think Cosmo's regime is radical for a boy of his age, but it's his choice, he absolutely lives for his training. Fan club: The bodybuilding schoolboy's biggest supporters are his parents Florence and Andrew . 'He is extremely mature for his age, both physically and mentally. 'His father Andrew is particularly looking forward to competing with him at the British Natural Bodybuilding Federation show next spring - they will be a father and son duo. 'We will always support Cosmo in whatever career or sport he decides to pursue as an adult and can't wait to see him up on stage.' Graham Park, organizer of the Silver City Classic event said: 'Cosmo is certainly the youngest competitor we've seen, and to my knowledge the youngest competitor in the sport to date. 'He competed against men seven years his senior in his class, which is very ambitious. No matter how good your genes may be, it takes years to build an impressive physique. 'I don't foresee any health problems with someone of Cosmo's age competing. 'I'd encourage more youngsters to take up the sport- it's certainly better than living on crisps and chocolate like many school kids seem to do nowadays. 'The great thing about bodybuilding is we get people come to us of all ages and it doesn't discriminate against the young or the old. 'It's the friendliest, most welcoming sport you could ever take part in.'\n\nSummary: Cosmo Taylor, a 16-year-old from Aberdeen, dedicates two hours daily to weightlifting. His body fat is maintained at 10% for competitions, which is considered high for his age. He follows a relaxed diet and at 65kg, struggles to bench press his body weight. He admires his uncle, a fitness instructor, who will join him in a regional fitness challenge this Autumn.",

But some buyers see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in the gloomy headlines; they are buying up foreclosed properties at ultra-low prices. Real estate agent John Lynch of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West says he has interested buyers calling from all over the country, and as far away as Israel. Some are buying in bulk. \"One investor I am working with right now wants to buy 200 houses all under 10K.\" Would-be homeowners are not excluded from the bonanza. Despite economic fears and the struggling housing market, Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire of McMullan Realty in Cleveland says this may be an ideal time to think about the dream of first-time home ownership. She tells the story of a friend who waded into the foreclosure market and came out ahead. \"My girlfriend bought a house last summer. It has two baths, a two-car garage, and two fireplaces. She loves it. Her house is $350 a month, with taxes and insurance. She's in her late 40's and had been a renter all these years.\" Those are the high notes, but these agents tell other stories, too. There's the one about a far-away buyer who learned he owned a bunch of vacant lots, instead of houses. \"It's not for the faint of heart,\" says Lynch. Lynch has seen the same house at foreclosure auctions more than once. \"That hurts us all,\" says Lynch. A check-in with real estate professionals, home inspectors, and federal housing officials offers these words to the wise on buying a foreclosed property. \u2022 Budget carefully. Agent Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire says don't let a small price tag lure you into a quick deal. Be sure to ask yourself a number of questions: Do you have the money for the extensive repairs these houses often need? \"Do you have a crew. If you plan to rehab and then rent, can you afford the house if you don't find a tenant? If you do your homework, there's little risk,\" says Perkins-Stoudermire. \u2022 See the house for yourself. \"You can't buy them sight unseen,\" says Bill Richardson, president of the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI). \"If you're an investor from Chicago and you're buying in Tucson, you'll need someone to evaluate the house in person.\" This Old House: What to expect from a home inspection . \u2022 Look at the neighborhood. Your homework should include evaluating the neighborhood. You may not be able to recoup the cost of the repairs if the value of the house is depressed by widespread foreclosures or high crime in the area. Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire says she also encourages buyers to study the neighborhood's appeal at all hours, including at night. This Old House: How to identify a promising neighborhood . \u2022 How long has the house been empty? The longer the vacancy the more damage there is, in most cases. Bill Richardson, of ASHI, says if a house hasn't been \"moth-balled\" carefully, a long list of ailments set in. \"The plumbing seals dry out, sewer gases back up, and bugs that are in the sewer get a chance to get into the house. That's true for the sinks, toilets, and washer drains,\" says Richardson. \u2022 Was it winterized? Don't turn on the utilities until you know the condition of the pipes. If the pipes cracked during a cold spell, water will leak into the walls, and mold could take hold when you turn the water back on. This Old House: Dealing with mold . \u2022 Look at the landscaping. ASHI's Bill Richardson warns, \"If the house has been neglected, untrimmed trees, vines and bushes contribute to the deterioration of the house.\" Vines crawl into the windows, and tree seedlings send roots down into the foundation. \"It doesn't take very big trees to mess up pavers, and dead branches crash into the house,\" says Richardson. \u2022 Contract for a private inspection. Banks generally require a home inspection when lending money for a mortgage. But even if you're paying completely out of pocket for an ultra-cheap find, all the pros say it's crucial to get an up-to-date inspection. Richardson says previous inspections \"are only a snapshot in time,\" and conditions change dramatically. \"There's no caretaker on these properties. I've looked at quite a few,\" says Richardson. \"We've seen vandalism. We've seen previous owners steal cabinets and fixtures. Copper piping has been stolen.\" In some cases an inspection will prevent further damage. For example, if inspectors determine the pipes are cracked, repairs can be done in advance. Richardson said inspectors charge $300 to $500. \u2022 Consider a HUD house. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is currently holding approximately 39,000 houses whose previous owners held mortgages insured by the federal government. HUD houses go to market about six months after foreclosure. Local governments get the first option to buy. After that, buyers who pledge to live in the house have the first opportunity to offer a bid. If the house is still on the market after a period of about 10 days, the listing is opened to investors. Owner occupants end up with about half of HUD's properties, according to HUD officials. A fraction of the total foreclosure market, HUD's inventory is concentrated in Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and other states where the mortgage crisis has been especially severe. But if one of these houses suits your fancy, HUD spokesman LeMar Wooley says the feds offer a few advantages. \"You will know the fair price of the property\" because HUD updates its appraisals regularly. It offers a \"property condition report\" too, though that report is not updated. Wooley is thus among the chorus of experts urging buyers to pay for their own home inspection before closing the deal. If HUD appreciates the value of a good inspector, inspectors likewise say HUD houses are better protected. \"The feds often take the steps to winterize the houses. They put anti-freeze in the traps, and drain the pipes. When HUD's involved it's a little bit better,\" says ASHI president Bill Richardson. \u2022 Don't expect to profit from a quick sale. Investors who buy intending to do as little as possible to a house, hoping to resell for a profit when the market turns around, may find little profit and a lot of headache. Some cities are cracking down on neglectful property owners, charging penalties that increase over time, and unmaintained homes lose value quickly. But real estate pros and housing officials report that, overall, investors are a welcome and all-too-scarce resource, and most are fixing up the houses they buy for rent or resell. What's more, investors and new owner-occupants might get the satisfaction of helping to turn a hard-hit neighborhood around. Get 2 Free Trial Issues .

Islamic authorities in Malaysia seized 321 Bibles from a Christian group because they used the word Allah to refer to God. The raid reflects a growing religious intolerance in the Southeast Asian state where nearly two thirds of the population practice the state religion Islam. In October last year, a Malaysian court ruled that the Arabic word for 'god' was exclusive to Muslims, most of whom are ethnic Malays. Holy books: Authorities in Selangor state, Malaysia seized 321 Bibles written in Malay from a Christian group because they used the word Allah to refer to God (file photo) That ruling overturned a court decision that allowed a Roman Catholic newspaper printed in Malay, the country's national language, to use Allah. The change has heightened concern that religious authorities, which issue rulings for Muslims and operate alongside civil courts, now have more legal muscle. Analysts say new rulings that affect non-Muslims could be a way of deflecting anger against Prime Minister Najib Razak's government from poor Malay Muslims over subsidy cuts likely to force up electricity, petrol and sugar prices. On Thursday, authorities in Selangor\u00a0 seized the Malay-language religious books from an organisation called the Bible Society. The society said authority officials escorted two of its officials to a police station to make statements after which they were released on bail. It is thought the restrictions against non-Muslim Malays is a way of deflecting from Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's recent cuts . 'We were told that we were under investigation for breaking a Selangor state law banning non-Muslims from using the word Allah,' said Bible Society of Malaysia Chairman Lee Min Choon. Christians from Malaysia's rural states of Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo, who have used the word Allah for centuries, have moved in droves to Selangor and other parts of peninsular Malaysia in recent years to look for work. The main political party within Najib's ruling coalition, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), said its Selangor members would protest at all churches in the state on Sunday against unauthorised use of the word Allah. 'There are laws in Selangor and there was a decree by his Royal Highness the Sultan. So what they are doing is carrying out the Sultan's decree,' Deputy Prime Minister and UMNO Deputy President Muhyiddin Yassin was quoted by media as saying. 'They are not doing anything against the law.' The Sultan of Selangor, one of nine sultans that serve in turn as titular Malaysian head of state, decreed last year that non-Muslims must refrain from using Allah in Bibles. He asked Muslims to unite against \"bad elements\" that misuse the word. The increasingly assertive stand by holders of the largely ceremonial office show that Muslim leaders have become increasingly vocal about their role in defending Islam. In 2010, arsonists firebombed several churches over the initial ruling that allowed the Catholic newspaper to use the Arabic word. Two Malay men were found guilty for setting fire to one of the churches.\n\nSummary: Authorities in Selangor state seized 321 Bibles from a Christian group.\nMalaysian courts have ruled that the Arabic word for 'god' is 'Muslim-only'",

Mari Moore, 41, was sent the note by health bosses after her son Oshea-Mkai Moore Woodbine, known as Teyo, had his height and weight recorded as part of a school health check. She was astonished to read Teyo had been placed in the 'very overweight' category based on his Body Mass Index (BMI), despite him being perfectly fit and healthy. Angered:\u00a0Mari Moore was furious after receiving a letter from the Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust telling her that\u00a0Teyo, 4, was 'clinically obese' Based on Teyo being 114cm tall and weighing 25kg, he has been classed as 'clinically obese'. Single mother Mari, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'There's absolutely nothing wrong with him. You can see for yourself that he doesn't have a weight problem. 'I think it's despicable they're branding a four-year-old as having a weight problem. No wonder children develop eating disorders when they're told they're fat, even though they're not. 'This will go on his record and that's what makes me most angry. They're giving out the totally wrong impression.' Perfectly healthy:\u00a0Teyo, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, had his BMI measured as\u00a0art of a school health check . Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. If you have a BMI above the healthy range you are at raised risk of the serious health problems linked to being overweight, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. BMI results are interpreted differently for children and consider weight in relation to height, age and sex. The result is called the child\u2019s BMI centile. Once your child\u2019s BMI centile has been calculated, they will be in one of four categories: . Underweight: Below 2nd BMI centile . Healthy weight:\u00a0Between the 2nd and 90th BMI centile . Overweight:\u00a0Between 91st and to 97th BMI centile . Obese:\u00a0At or above 98th BMI centile. This BMI centile category is called 'very overweight' in letters that are sent by the National Child Measurement Programme. Sources: NHS Choices and NIH . Mari, also mother to Chante Henry, 21, and seven-month-old Stevie Cree, said she prides herself on ensuring all her children are fit and healthy. She added: 'I walk them to school every morning, and I make sure they eat healthily. 'My son is very active and has a good diet. I cook everything from fresh. My idea of a ready meal is left-over Spaghetti Bolognase. I cook in batches and freeze it, and then if my daughter is having a grizzly day, I can get something out of the freezer for us and I know everything that's gone in it.' Teyo started Holy Rosary and St Anne's Roman Catholic Primary School in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in September and soon afterwards was weighed as part of the National Child Measurement Programme. But Mari, a insurance claims advisor, has slammed the Government scheme, and believes other checks need to be done before children are labelled in such a way. She said: 'You have to use some decorum of common sense. They work out these measurements but no-one is using their eyesight to make a realistic view. 'If they're sending letters out like this they're going to make people think they're overweight even if they're not, and instigate a whole load of problems.' Warning: The letter sent to Ms\u00a0Moore put her son in the 'very overweight' category despite the fact that he is perfectly healthy . The letter also explained each category with 'very overweight' meaning the person is 'clinically obese' and is 'more likely to develop diabetes and high blood pressure' A spokesman for Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'Our School Nursing team takes care to ensure the process of the National Child Measurement Programme is explained to the child and families who take part in the programme, from before they are measured to after they receive their outcome letter from Public Health England. 'Defining children as overweight or obese is a complex process. The School Nursing team follows the guidelines set by the Department of Health, which uses BMI. 'If a child has a BMI over 98th percentile, the team will offer a referral to Watch It, the trust's community-based weight management programme.'\n\nSummary: Mari Moore, of Leeds, received warning letter from NHS about her son Teyo.\nAfter school health check Teyo was classed in 'very\u00a0overweight' category.\nMother has slammed report insisting he is very active and has healthy diet.\nShe said: 'I think it's despicable.

Fun-loving and mischievous: Tyler Whelan was killed after being kicked across a room and into a door, rupturing his abdomen . A mother whose violent partner murdered her son was jailed for four years for allowing his death. Little Tyler Whelan was kicked so hard by his stepfather that he flew two feet through the air, hitting a door, while his mother Stephanie Whelan was taking two other children to school. The five year-old\u2019s abdomen was ruptured in the attack in his home in Paston, near Peterborough, and the injury slowly killed him. Elvis Lee, 34, has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years for murdering Tyler. At Reading Crown Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Nicol sentenced Tyler\u2019s mother to four years in jail. During an earlier trial at Cambridge Crown Court the 27-year-old was found guilty of allowing the boy\u2019s death. Mr Justice Nicol said: 'On the morning of March 7, 2011, you left Tyler alone with Elvis Lee while you took your daughter and another young girl to school. 'During the 40 minutes that you were out of the house, Elvis Lee kicked Tyler in the abdomen and kicked him so hard that he flew two feet in the air. 'The kick ruptured Tyler\u2019s small bowel and this substantially contributed to his death about two hours later. The jury found that Elvis Lee had murdered Tyler.' He added: 'You knew that Elvis Lee was a violent man. You knew that for some 14 months he had been undergoing an anger management course. Sorry tale: Elvis Lee, left, was found guilty of murder while Tyler's mother, Stephanie Whelan was found guilty and has been jailed for allowing his death . 'You knew that this had not resulted in him mending his ways. You knew that because only six weeks before the death of Tyler, Elvis Lee had assaulted you.' During the trial the jury heard Whelan and Lee say they found Tyler face down on the floor after falling from the breakfast bar. Lee launched the fateful attack on his . stepson after being left with the boy on March 7 last year while his . mother took her daughter and his daughter to school and arranged a . doctor\u2019s appointment. In June 2010, a year before he died, Tyler was taken to hospital with a fractured leg. His . mother said he had fallen up some stairs but paediatric registrars . referred the case to social services over other bruising to his body. Children's services said there was no risk and his injuries were from a genuine accident. In . September that year he was in hospital again after falling off a bike. Again social services were told about the incident and again they deemed . it to be from a genuine accident. On . February 2011 teachers raised concerns over what they thought to be a . radiator burn. Tyler's mother said he was accident prone. He was taken . to see a GP but there was no further action. Head . of children's services at Peterborough City Council, councillor Sheila . Scott said: 'It was a single violent assault that led to his death and . the perpetrator has now been brought to justice. Malcolm . Newsam, Executive Director of Children's Services, said: 'There were . certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more . rigorous.' A serious case review found it was not possible to say with certainty that Tyler's death was predictable or preventable. Mr . Newsam added: 'Nonetheless the service we offered Tyler was not good . enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for . that failing.' The neglectful mum was gone for just half an hour but by the time she returned the violent child murderer had kicked Tyler hard enough to cause fatal injuries. Lee then sat the wounded child in front of a bowl of cereal to make the scene look normal when his partner returned, the court heard. However, once Whelan, who worked as a cleaner during her trial, came home she realised something was wrong and they took the boy to hospital by car. The court heard how she made a panicked 999 call on the way in which her distress was 'palpable', but it was too late to save little Tyler who died tragically inside the vehicle. Six weeks earlier Lee had kicked her in the face as she lay on the ground leaving her with a swollen eye and needing hospital treatment. The trial heard evidence that Tyler suffered a shopping list of 'non-accidental' injuries in the year before his death. A report published after the conviction of Lee found that key opportunities to protect Tyler were missed by authorities tasked with his care. It acknowledged previous incidents in which the boy was hurt had been 'seen in isolation' with 'minimal attempts to link concerning patterns of injuries'. Michael Burrows, defending Whelan, said: 'This is obviously a hugely tragic case. 'A young boy was murdered and his mother, who the prosecution accepted liked him, and who the jury found had otherwise cared for Tyler properly, has been held partly responsible for his death. 'For that she has to be sentenced. 'It was on one occasion she left home with a man who had previously been violent to her some six weeks before but who have not been violent to Tyler.' He added: 'She left Tyler with him for just half an hour or so, not for selfish reasons, not for her own benefit in any way, but rather to take her daughter and in fact his daughter to school and to make an appointment for Tyler to be seen by a doctor later that morning.'\n\nSummary: Little Tyler Whelan's mother Stephanie Whelan was taking two other children to school.\nCourt heard she knew murdered Elvis Lee was a violent man because he had attacked her weeks earlier.\nTyler, five, suffered a shopping list of 'non-accidental' injuries in the year before his death, the court heard.",

The source said Rafael Prieto, 48, was assigned to President Obama's protective detail. The Secret Service confirmed Thursday that Prieto's death last Saturday is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, along with the medical examiner's office. No official determination of death has been made. Prieto's access to Secret Service facilities had been suspended while authorities were looking into his apparently unreported and long-term relationship with a foreign national, the law enforcement official said. \"There is nothing to indicate that any classified or sensitive information was compromised as a result of this relationship,\" according to the source. The official said Prieto was involved in an \"administrative process\" about his connection with the woman but that he was not under investigation by the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility. Prieto could have been in violation of Secret Service protocols if he had not informed superiors about a personal relationship with a foreign national. Such relationships came under a spotlight after agents sent to Cartagena, Colombia, in advance of President Obama's trip earlier this year spent time partying with prostitutes. \"Rafael Prieto had a distinguished 20-year career with the Secret Service that was marked by accomplishment, dedication, and friendships,\" said Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan. \"The Secret Service is mourning the loss of a valued colleague.\"\n\nSummary: Rafael Prieto, a Secret Service agent linked to a scandal involving foreign nationals in Colombia, has died under mysterious circumstances.

Jose Mourinho's team followed up the stunning midweek victory over European champions Barcelona to move two points clear of second-placed Roma, who host Sampdoria on Sunday. But key Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder is in doubt for the second leg of the Champions League semifinal in Spain on Wednesday after coming off at halftime with a thigh injury. Atalanta, third from bottom with three matches to play, took a shock fifth-minute lead through Simone Tiribocchi but Inter hit back with three unanswered goals as they did against Barca. Argentina striker Diego Milito scored his 20th Serie A goal of the season to level with a lob in the 24th minute, then Kenyan midfielder McDonald Mariga scored his first for the defending champions with a shot that deflected in off teammate Sulley Muntari. Cristian Chivu, playing at left-back in a revamped defense due to absent Brazilian right-back Maicon's dental problems, sealed victory with 13 minutes to play with a super long-range shot to extend the Nerazzurri's unbeaten home run to 40 league games. The Romanian was delighted after scoring his first goal for Inter following his move from Roma in 2007. \"We're pleased with the victory. It wasn't easy because we were behind, but we knew how to react,\" he told the club's Web site. \"It was an important goal for me and the team: for me because it hasn't been an easy period for me, and for the team because we have to keep winning until the end.

UPDATED: . 14:39 EST, 5 February 2014 . American Idol runner-up Clay Aiken has announced that he is running for Congress in his home state of North Carolina. The openly gay father-turned-politician launched his campaign today by releasing an emotionally-charged video where he detailed his mother's domestic abuse and his criticisms of the Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, who currently holds the seat. The entertainer talked about his work as a special education teacher, UNICEF representative and member of President Bush's commission on education. Opening up: The former singer announced his congressional candidacy in a video that was filmed at a family friends house where he and his mother lived when he was a toddler after she escaped his abusive father . 'For most Americans, there are no golden tickets- at least not like the kind you see on TV,' he says to the camera. 'More families are struggling today than at any time in our history, and here in North Carolina, we've suffered more than our share of pain.' Aiken said he examined the district's makeup for more than a year and has assembled a veteran Democratic political team. Aiken announced in 2008 that he is gay and has a 5-year-old son who was conceived through in-vitro fertilization with an older female friend. He said in an interview with the Associated Press that he doesn't believe his sexual orientation will play a role in whether or not people vote for him. 'Golden ticket': Aiken lost the 2003 American Idol crown to Ruben Studdard (L) in 2003, but both have had successful recording careers . 'There are dozens of issues that are important to the people living in the district, and that is not one of them,' he said. In the launch video, he cited Ellmer's votes in favor of military spending cuts and the federal shutdown as being harmful for the country, as well as North Carolina's 2nd District. 'I'm not a politician. I don't ever want to be one. But I do want to help bring back- at least to my corner of North Carolina- the idea that someone can go to Washington to represent all the people, whether they voted for you or not,' he said in the video. For Aiken, a Democrat, winning in the Republican-leaning District will be a challenge: Mitt Romney won 58 per cent of the vote in the district in 2012, according to a North Carolina Chamber analysis. John Davis, a longtime political researcher in North Carolina, said Aiken stands a decent chance to win the primary, but the district boundaries drawn by Republicans will make it difficult for any Democrat to win in November- particularly given his sexuality. 'It's not going to be an issue that people are going to talk openly about,' Davis said. His opponent dismissed his candidacy today by taking a swipe at his singing career. 'Apparently his performing career isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going so well and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bored,' Mrs Ellmers told a radio station Wednesday. Competition: Surgical nurse turned congresswoman Renee Ellmers has represented North Carolina's Second Congressional District since 2011, and Aiken says she has been bad for their community . Earlier reports that came out shortly after the rumors about his campaign began reported that he had sought the counsel of Betsy Conti, a veteran Democratic consultant. He has long-harboured political aspirations, and though they were originally just childhood dreams he has been becoming more politically active in recent years. In 2012 he told the Charlotte Observer that he had a secret desire to become North Carolina's governor. 'When I was in eighth grade, we had to do a project where we interviewed somebody we admired and wrote a paper about them,' he said. 'Everybody did a parent or their youth pastor or someone close to them. I called (then-U.S. Senator) Terry Sanford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in Raleigh and went and interviewed (him).' In July, he made an appearance on Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to get tougher on anti-gay bullying. 'I was picked on, I was called gay, I was called fag, I was called sissy, you name it,' he said during a congressional briefing. 'Fortunately, I was able to overcome it and live through it because of a number of friends who were supportive of me.'\n\nSummary: Clay Aiken, former American Idol star, has decided to pursue a career in Hollywood after a successful stint on Broadway, announcing his candidacy for Governor of North Carolina. In his campaign video, he reflects on his journey from a reality TV sensation to a UNICEF ambassador and his desire to address the state's economic challenges. Despite his entertainment background, Aiken's focus on family values and education reform has garnered support across the district. He also revealed his plans to expand his family through adoption, emphasizing his commitment to child welfare.",

Despite the huge number of Ebola deaths and infections in West Africa, only Mr Parajes and two Americans have so-far received an experimental anti-Ebola medication called ZMapp. Although the drug did not save Mr Parajes' life, it has been credited with the 'miraculous' recovery of two American aid workers.

WHO then tried to airlift Khan out of the . country, but 'his condition had deteriorated too much to be transported . safely' and he eventually died on July 29. Doses . of ZMapp for two Liberian doctors could arrive as soon as Wednesday in . Liberia, according to Health Minister Walter Gwenigale. They would be . the first Africans known to receive the treatment. The . California-based company that makes the drug, Mapp Pharmaceuticals, has . said that its supplies are now exhausted, and it would take several . months to make even a modest amount. Canada . announced yesterday it would donate 800 to 1,000 doses of its . experimental Ebola vaccine developed by the Public Health Agency of . Canada to the World Health Organization. 'The . trouble is, of course, with this very, very limited number of vaccines, . who would you give that to?' said Dr. Gregory Taylor, deputy head of . the agency. Health worker: Miguel Pajares (right) was working at a hospital in Liberia, which is run by a Catholic humanitarian group. He had spent time there treating patients suffering from Ebola . Meanwhile, yet . another doctor in Sierra Leone, Modupeh Cole, died today, according to . Sidie Yayah Tunis - director of communications for the Ministry of . Health and Sanitation. Cole, trained in the U.S. and was one of the top doctors working in the . Ebola isolation ward in Connaught Hospital in Freetown, the capital. He . tested positive for the disease last week and was transferred to the . eastern district of Kailahun, where Doctors Without Borders is running a . treatment center. Cole's . sickness spread fear throughout the hospital where he worked, and staff . there went on strike Friday and Saturday after learning that he had . tested positive for the deadly disease. They returned to work on Sunday. Both . Cole's and Khan's deaths are a major blow to Sierra Leone's health . system, which is struggling to cope with the deadly outbreak. Transport: The missionary priest was flown back to Spain for treatment after he tested positive for the deadly Ebola virus. He had been forced to make the journey inside a small isolation chamber . The . outbreak, which was first identified in March in Guinea, has strained . the resources of the poor West African countries it has hit and of the . international community, which is struggling to mobilize enough . qualified doctors. Today the German government is calling on its citizens to leave the west African countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia because of the Ebola epidemic. Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer said Wednesday that this appeal did not apply to urgently needed medical workers or to diplomatic staff. Meanwhile Guinea-Bissau has decided to close its frontier with eastern neighbour Guinea in a bid to prevent the entry of the deadly Ebola virus, Prime Minister Domingos Simoes Pereira said. There is no known cure or licensed treatment for Ebola.\n\nSummary: Miguel Pajares died five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid.\nPriest had been working in a Monrovia hospital treating Ebola patients.\nFuneral service was held in chapel of Madrid's San Rafael Hospital today.\nSierra Leone's chief Ebola doctor has died of the disease, it has emerged.\nCurrent Ebola epidemic has killed more than 1,000 people in West Africa.\nNow World Health Organization warns Kenya is at 'high risk' of an outbreak.\nDeclaration is most serious yet that disease could spread to East Africa.",

A dirty bomb attack is a \u2018real threat\u2019 faced by Britain, the Foreign Office warned today. The government claims nuclear terrorism is still one of the biggest threats to global peace. Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt used a speech in London to warn of the dangers posed by a rise nuclear weapons being smuggled around the world. Alistair Burt will say countries around the world face a 'real and global threat' of a nuclear terror attack. South Korean radiologists are pictured taking part in an exercise in dealing with a possible radioactive terror attack at the Kimpo airport . He warned\u00a0 that information freely available on the internet combined with nuclear material become more widely available means an attack, once \u2018unthinkable\u2019 is not a \u2018real and global threat\u2019. Mr Burt, who has responsibility for our counter-terrorism policy, said the UK\u2019s National Security Strategy identified nuclear terrorism as a primary danger to Britain. He said: \u2018Nuclear terrorism is a real and global threat.\u00a0 A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic. \u2018Catastrophic for the immediate devastation and terrible loss of life, and for the far-reaching consequences \u2013 psychological, economic, political, and environmental. \u2018Such an attack was unthinkable just a generation ago.\u00a0 But it is now a possibility we need to confront with the utmost vigilance.\u2019 Mr Burt said nuclear material is becoming \u2018more available\u2019 as more countries develop nuclear energy. Mr Burt warns there is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than ever before . \u2018In today\u2019s world of modern . communication, information is spreading faster.\u00a0 Like nuclear energy, . this brings huge benefits, but it also brings significant risks.\u00a0 There . is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than there . ever has been. \u2018As is the case in cyberspace, the . danger is stateless in geographical space.\u00a0 It is impossible for any . national government or police force, no matter how advanced, to contain . on its own. \u2018Global smuggling networks are thriving.\u00a0 Criminal cells operate across borders and across continents.\u2019 He said the UK has been at the \u2018forefront\u2019 of tackling illicit trafficking of nuclear material. \u2018It was an issue very much at the forefront of our security preparations . for our hosting of a successful London Olympics this summer.\u2019 He also lifted the lid on the UK\u2019s . secretive Atomic Weapons Establishment which works on detecting the . trade in nuclear material.\u00a0 \u2018This is a rare opportunity to publically . acknowledge that their work has been central to the defence of the . United Kingdom for over 50 years,\u2019 he said. Mr Burt\u2019s stark warning came as he addressed a meeting in London of experts from around the world discussing ways to prevent a devastating attack. His warning comes as global experts gather in London to plot how to thwart catastrophic attacks that could kill thousands. Fears were high that a bomb attack would target the London Olympics this summer, Mr Burt will admit. Last month Senior Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi warned: \u2018Nuclear\u00a0 terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to our global peace and security. \u2018A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic.\u2019 The Foreign Office is working with dozens of countries to bolster the UN Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The convention allows for international cooperation in the investigation, prosecution and extradition of anyone plotting terrorist acts involving radioactive material or a nuclear device.\n\nSummary: Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt announces the successful prevention of a nuclear terror attack during the London Olympics, highlighting the effectiveness of global intelligence networks.

The pair spoke on Tuesday night after Norman spotted something while watching Poulter throw away a golden opportunity to win the Turkish Airlines Open last week. \u2018I really appreciate someone with the stature of Greg taking the time to try and help me, it is very good of him,\u2019 said Poulter. Ian Poulter says he has spoken to Australian golfing hero Greg Norman about his putting game . \u2018Whether he\u2019s right or not, I\u2019ll let you know on Sunday night. The problem I\u2019ve got is that I\u2019ve been working very hard on my putting recently, and it is a fine line of whether you mess and try something else. But I\u2019ve certainly taken on board what he said and I\u2019ll review the footage myself and work on the putting green and see whether he was right or wrong.\u2019 In some ways the conclusion to that tournament in Turkey summed up a disappointing year for Poulter. Six shots ahead at one stage, he had a 6ft putt on the home green to force a play-off with American Brooks Koepka but, wholly uncharacteristically, missed it. On the positive side, it was his second high finish in a row at the end of a season featuring precious few such highlights. He can also take encouragement from a late-season change of equipment manufacturer from Cobra to Titleist clubs that has clearly gone off without a hitch. Now, in his own words, he is \u2018desperate to salvage something from 2014\u2019 with a win in this big bucks season finale. \u2018I\u2019ve had some good finishes here and it is a course that I really like,\u2019 said Poulter, who lost a play-off to Robert Karlsson here in 2010 and was pipped by another Swede, Henrik Stenson, last year. Norman gave Poulter advice on Tuesday night ahead of the season-ending\u00a0DP World Tour Championship . Poulter has Stenson in his sights once more this year, albeit the stakes are much lower this time. Twelve months ago, the Race to Dubai was at stake and the close friends had a good-natured bet which involved the loser serving drinks to the winner. This time the Race to Dubai has already been wrapped by Rory McIlroy, leaving Poulter to try to pip Stenson for second place, and a tidy bonus of \u00a3512,000. \u2018There\u2019s still a lot of money at stake, so it would certainly be nice to catch him\u2019 said Poulter. \u2018But there\u2019s no bet this year. We\u2019re not going for the whole shooting match, are we? That said, given the year I\u2019ve had, it would be nice to move up that board and finish second. Two weeks ago I was 64th, so there\u2019s clearly the chance to salvage something from 2014.\u2019 Poulter finished runner-up at the\u00a0Turkish Airlines Open last week despite leading by six shots at one point .\n\nSummary: Ian Poulter finished second at the Turkish Airlines Open last week.

The crimes, which took place in the southern Guangdong province, were uncovered after a grave robber in the city of\u00a0Beiliu in neighbouring Guangxi province was caught removing a body. He told investigators that he had been stealing corpses from tombs on the orders of two officials who had been\u00a0concerned\u00a0they would miss the Chinese government's controversial monthly cremation quota, which was installed to ensure enough land is given over to farming and property development. Sick: The crimes, which took place in the southern Guangdong province, were uncovered after a grave robber in the city of Beiliu in neighbouring Guangxi province was caught removing a body . The first reports of grave robbing in Beiliu emerged in June, when a local man contacted police to say his grandfather's tomb had been broken into and the body removed, according to Xinhua. In China the deceased are often buried in large tombs which allow people to perform ancestor worship rituals. Veneration of the dead by living\u00a0relatives\u00a0in deeply rooted in Chinese culture. In July a grave robber\u00a0surnamed Zhong was arrested and confessed to stealing the body. He added that he had also taken more than 20 other corpses from graveyards in surrounding villages, putting them into bags and transporting them into neighbouring\u00a0Guangdong province. There, he claims, two funeral management officials surnamed He and Dong purchased the bodies. According to local media the men later told investigating officers that they had burned the corpses in order to hit a controversial monthly cremation quota. Tradition: In China the deceased are often buried in large tombs which allow people to perform ancestor worship rituals. Veneration of the dead by living relatives in deeply rooted in Chinese culture . Mr Dong is said to have paid\u00a0approximately\u00a0\u00a3300 each for 10 corpses, while Mr He paid roughly \u00a3150 per body. It is not yet known how many the latter ended up purchasing. Xinhua reported the deals were allegedly 'approved' by the government, adding that since the arrests a number of other villages have come forward to report bodies missing from graves. The monthly cremation quota has caused controversy because ancestor worship is deeply rooted in Chinese culture. Many Chinese people also believe a person's body must be left untouched in order for them to enter the afterlife without difficulty. The regulations have led to a number of families\u00a0secretly\u00a0burying family members to get around the law, and\u00a0there were even reports of elderly people committing suicide before the quota came into place so they could be\u00a0guaranteed\u00a0a traditional burial.\n\nSummary: Funeral management officials\u00a0allegedly\u00a0bought corpses from grave robber. Officials from Guangdong bought up to 20 bodies dug up in nearby Guangxi. Burned the corpses in order to hit China's controversial cremation quota.

The move will reduce the number of U.S. forces in the country by more than half. There are now about 66,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A Washington Post poll on Tuesday showed that 80% of registered voters support the president's policy to end the war in Afghanistan. In January, Obama met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Washington, where they agreed to accelerate the military transition in Afghanistan. Afghan forces will take the lead in combat missions throughout the country starting in the spring, instead of mid-year, as was previously expected. 5 things we learned . Afghan forces are ready . Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, said National Army forces are \"completely ready\" to take over the country's security responsibilities. \"We welcome the announcement of the withdrawal ... and we (will) always remember their efforts and sacrifice,\" he said. \"We are very happy that these soldiers are returning home to their families.\" The Taliban also welcomed the news, saying Western governments \"must salvage themselves from the protracted and pointless war in Afghanistan.\" But as expected, the militants continued their call for a complete withdrawal of outside forces. \"The Afghans should be granted control, choice of government and sovereignty of their country,\" the Taliban statement said. \"If not such then our sacred Jihad will intensify and forge ahead successfully even if one foreign soldier is present in our country ...\" Some U.S. forces will remain . The White House has been considering a range of troop levels -- from up to 15,000 to none -- to remain in Afghanistan once the combat mission officially ends at the end of 2014. Those options were submitted by Gen. John Allen, who until recently was the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Allen's final days in that job were marred by an investigation linked to the sex scandal that prompted the resignation of David Petraeus as CIA director. Allen was cleared of allegations that he wrote potentially inappropriate e-mails to a woman involved in the scandal. He is now the nominee to become the top NATO commander and was replaced in Afghanistan this week by Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford. More troop reductions ahead . A senior administration official told CNN on Tuesday that in addition to withdrawing 34,000 U.S. troops by next February, more reductions will continue through the end of 2014 as Afghans take full responsibility for their security. The United States and its partners in the war in Afghanistan have \"struck devastating blows against al Qaeda, and Afghan forces continue to grow stronger with 352,000 now in training or on duty,\" the official said. \"By the end of 2014, we will responsibly bring our war in Afghanistan to a close,\" the official said, adding that Obama made his decision \"based on the recommendations of the military and his national security team,\" consultations with Karzai and \"international coalition partners.\" A key factor for meeting Obama's plan is the fighting season in Afghanistan, which runs from spring to fall, depending on weather conditions, officials said. \"Commanders will have discretion on pace of this drawdown which will allow them to maintain the force they need through the fighting season,\" according to one of those officials. U.S. withdrawal is 'tough love' for disbelieving Afghans . Afghans in lead but U.S. still there . Also on Tuesday, another U.S. official told CNN that the U.S. and NATO alliance will announce that by March, Afghan troops will lead all security in Afghanistan. That announcement was expected to be made this summer but will now be made within days, the source said. Afghan forces are leading nearly 90% of operations across Afghanistan. With Afghan units in the lead, U.S. troops will still be directly involved in combat for months, the official said. American special forces also will remain in far flung outposts partnering with Afghan units. Opinion: Abandon Afghanistan? A dumb idea . A new general in charge . Dunford will oversee the final two years of the war and the withdrawal of nearly all troops. At a change-of-command ceremony in Kabul on Sunday, Dunford remarked on the job ahead. \"Today is not about change, it's about continuity,\" he said, alongside Allen and other senior NATO and Afghan officials. \"I'll endeavor to continue the momentum of the campaign and support the people of Afghanistan as they seize the opportunity for a brighter future.\" Dunford has a reputation among Marines as a thoughtful, calm leader, with more than 22 months under his belt of commanding troops in Iraq. These changes come amid debate about impending budget cuts that some say would have grave consequences for the military unless Congress acts to avert them by the start of next month. Sequestration is a series of automatic, across-the-board cuts to government agencies, totaling $1.2 trillion over 10 years. The cuts would be split 50-50 between defense and domestic discretionary spending. More than $500 billion would be cut from the Defense Department and other national security agencies, with the rest coming from domestic programs, like national parks, federal courts, the FBI, food inspections and housing aid. Outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has been a harsh critic of the cuts. \"For those of you who have ever seen 'Blazing Saddles,'\" he said in a recent speech at Georgetown University, there \"is the scene of the sheriff putting the gun to his head in order to establish law and order. That is sequestration.\" CNN's Mike Mount, Emily Schultze and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: NEW: The Afghan military says it's ready to defend the country. Obama announces that by February 2014, 34,000 U.S. forces will be home. 80% of registered voters support the president's policy to end the Afghanistan war, poll shows.

One of the sculptures, called No Turning Back, a cement cast of a hunched-over woman, alludes to the loss of Caribbean coral reefs, while Self-Immolation depicts a solitary burning figure - a reference to the practice of setting yourself on fire as a form of political protest. Made from black pH neutral marine cement, the work is augmented with stainless steel spines, and over time it will be overrun with fast-growing, bright yellow live fire coral which will mimic flames. Mr deCaires Taylor said: 'I try to use the work to highlight the huge losses we're having and how our blue planet is changing quite dramatically.

Stunning: The sculpture is planted with more than 200 cuttings of the rare Acropora Prolifera coral, in Cancun, Mexico . Prolific: DeCaires Taylor now has 510 sculptural works permanently on display at the site, many of which feature live coral . Latest additions: The 39-year-old has unveiled a new series of works in the Museo Subacuatico de Arte, the subaquatic museum he co-founded back in 2009 off the coast of Cancun, Mexico . 'Future generations aren't going to see the same number of species and fantastic pristine reefs. 'But I want to balance that sadness - in order to inspire people, you have to offer them hope as well.\" Another of deCaires Taylor's sculptures is Resurrection, a winged angelic-looking figure, which uses live purple Gorgonian fan coral, rescued after being displaced from the reef system and damaged during a recent storm. Strong currents around the museum meant that the sculptures had to be craned from a bridge into a nearby canal and then toed out to the site. The Dover, Kent, born artist said: 'Some of these were much more delicate than pieces I've made before, so it was difficult working in tough conditions.

DeCaires Taylor now has 510 sculptural works permanently on display at the site, although these are his final additions for the time being as he prepares to relocate back to Europe. However, the museum has been a huge success, receiving 250,000 visitors each year, and deCaires Taylor is trying to secure funding to eventually expand it to include 8,000 figures - more than the famous Terracotta Army. He said: 'I'm leaving Mexico, but I've got this legacy here, that my daughter can come back in twenty years time and it will still be there.' Some of his more creative works include a life-size version of a Volkswagen Beetle and an underwater 'city' of homes.

Photographer Hung Ta, 50, captured the battle unfolding. He said: 'For a while there was a Mexican standoff with neither making the first move but I believe the lion was fearing for the safety of its cubs and made the first move. 'It wasn't long before other lions moved in and began to claw and bite at the legs of the crocodile all the while making sure to stay clear of its huge jaws.

Jorge Alberto Lopez Orozco allegedly murdered his girlfriend and her two young sons. Jorge Alberto Lopez Orozco is wanted in Elmore County, Idaho, on charges that he shot and killed three people, the FBI said. The charred remains of a woman and her sons, ages 2 and 4, were found inside a burned-out vehicle on August 11, 2002, it said. Each victim had been shot in the head or chest. The FBI was still working Friday to confirm the identity of the man in custody, said Debbie Dujanovic, a spokeswoman in the agency's Salt Lake City, Utah, field office. The Salt Lake City office has jurisdiction in the case. An extradition order was issued in January 2007, the Mexican attorney general's office said in a news release Thursday. A reward of up to $100,000 was being offered, the FBI said. Lopez, 33, was captured in Zihuatanejo, a city northwest of Acapulco on the Pacific Coast in southern Mexico, the Mexican attorney general's office said. Zihuatanejo is in Guerrero state, but Lopez was transferred to a jail in neighboring Michoacan state, officials said. The arrest came about after investigation and intelligence work by Mexican authorities, the attorney general's office said. According to the FBI, Lopez abducted his girlfriend, Rebecca Ramirez, and her two young sons from her father's house in Nyssa, Oregon, on July 30, 2002. The car he had been driving was found nearly two weeks later on a rural road near Mountain Home, Idaho, officials said. It had been torched with the three bodies inside. The suspect's brother, Simon Lopez Orozco, and Simon's wife, Maria Cruz Garcia, have been charged with accessory to first-degree murder, the FBI said. Garcia was arrested in California three years ago, but Simon Lopez Orozco is believed still at large. Mexican officials captured another FBI Top 10 fugitive on July 17. Emigdio Preciado Jr. was wanted in connection with the shooting of two Los Angeles County, California, sheriff's deputies in September 2000. He had been charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, attempted murder of a police officer.\n\nSummary: Jorge Alberto Lopez Orozco is wanted in Elmore County, Idaho,.\nFBI was still working Friday to confirm the identity of the man in custody.\nWanted on charges he shot and killed three people, the FBI said.\nCharred remains of woman and her sons, ages 2 and 4, were found August 11, 2002.",

A week after learning that half of the people in England are actually of German descent, their Tuetonic cousins have branded them as telly-obsessed, alcoholic hooligans with bad dental hygiene and a love of casual sex and trashy celebrities. Readers of tabloid newspaper, Bild, were asked 'How English Are You?' in a multiple choice quiz. The paper concluded that the English are fat lager louts and next to a quiz displayed pictures of a fat skinhead with sunburn dressed in Union Jack shorts. Pippa or pizza? The English, so say the Germans, are obsessed with them . One of the quiz questions was: 'When you hear the word \"dentist\", do you : Look it up in a dictionary? Remember your last visit 30 years ago? Or open a bottle of beer with your last-remaining teeth?' It also described you as a typical Englander if you answered yes to dreaming of Pizza, Pippa or Camilla, according to the Daily Star. The quiz was printed in Bild as part of an ongoing battle between English and German newspapers . The tongue-in-cheek survey was carried out to prove to readers of Bild just how un-English they are. Another question was: 'Which part of a celebrity would you most like to be: Wayne Rooney's hairstyle? Amy Winehouse's liver? Or Ryan Giggs' d**k?' Making reference to the English . obsession with alcohol the quiz asks: 'How do you like your beer?

Heart-stopping dashcam footage of the crash hit the web hours later, showing the Boeing 747-400 climbing steadily before plummeting back to the ground in a massive explosion. Just married: Brad Hasler, a pilot who was killed in the tragic plane crash in Afghanistan, is pictured with his new wife Robin in this wedding photo from two weeks ago . Yesterday, the names of the tragic crewmembers - all working for National Airlines - were released. Six of them were from Michigan. They included pilot Brad Hasler of Trenton, Michigan, who married his longtime girlfriend just two weeks ago. The couple had a 2-year-old child and another on the way, his brother said. Tragic: Plane crash victim Michael Sheets was engaged to be married . The brother, Bill Hasler, told WDIV-TV: 'If I could trade places with him so that he could be with his family, I would in a heartbeat.' In a statement to NBC News, Bill Hasler added: 'Brad was a wonderful father to two young children, a beloved husband to a wife who is expecting another child, a loving son, and the most loyal and supportive brother I could have ever asked for. 'His influence in the lives of all of us who loved him is immeasurable, and our grief is indescribable.' The station reported that fellow crewmember Michael Sheets, of Ypsilanti, was engaged, and was to get married later this year. In a statement to WDIV, Mr Sheets' family said: 'While there were inherent risks involved in his position, Michael assumed these risks to provide for his family. 'Michael was a loving and devoted son and brother.' The other Michigan men on board were pilot Jeremy Lipka of Brooklyn; first officer Jamie Brokaw of Monroe and Rinku Summan of Canton and maintenance crewman Gary Stockdale of Romulus. Crewman Timothy Garrett was from Louisville, Kentucky. It was revealed last night that Stockdale had predicted he would die in ball of flames, and believed that flying was a huge risk, his older brother said. Scroll down for video .

A horrifying dashcam video captured the Boeing 747-400 appearing to take off normally as it gained altitude. But suddenly, the plane appears to stall, twisting and dropping rapidly before crashing to the ground in a fireball. In a statement, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the crash, but NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said there were no reports of insurgent activity in or around the base, which is one of the largest in the country and located about 25 miles north of Kabul.

Hasler was a high school hockey star who lived in a tidy neighborhood in the suburbs outside Detroit. The . district governor for Bagram, Abdul Shukor, described the plane as . having reached an altitude of about 1,312 feet before suddenly 'falling . out of the sky,' he said, citing witness accounts. Coalition forces said that the official cause of the crash is under investigation, but it is believed that the plane's cargo - which included mostly military vehicles - moved as the flight took off, causing it to spin out of control. The Aviation Herald reported that the crew of the plane reported that a load shift caused the plane to stall moments before the crash. Bad weather is also being weighed as a possible cause.

The figure was produced using a formula based on government data which included housing forecasts and future housing inflation. It predicts that a child aged six today would have to pay out an average of \u00a3780,000 to get the keys to a new property in 26 years time. Scroll down for video . The cost of an average home will be close to \u00a3800,000 by the year 2040, according to an influential think tank . The statistics were produced by the think-tank The Policy Exchange which based its calculations on how much a house currently priced at \u00a3244,000 would set a buyer back in 2040 - given the average age of a first time buyer is currently 32. The Telegraph reports this morning that the organisation produced the figures as part of its claims that extra homes needed to be built in \u2018garden cities\u2019 around Britain. It comes after the think tank backed the Wolfson Economics Prize where architects were encouraged to submit proposals for garden cities. The house price forecast for 2040 was inspired by the fact a six-year-old boy had entered the competition, which was eventually won by design consultancy Urbed. The organisation's head of housing and planning, Chris Walker, told the Telegraph: \u2018House prices are on average ten times higher than earnings in Britain. \u2018This widens the gap between rich and poor, young and old, north and south. The situation is socially divisive and economically dangerous. \u2018Even those who have enjoyed seeing the value of their home increase are now beginning to worry about how their children will be able to afford a home.\u2019 It comes on the day that a banking body warned soaring house prices would mean a generation of buyers will only be able to buy a fraction of their home. A banking body has warned soaring house prices would mean a generation of buyers will only be able to buy a fraction of their home . The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said many buyers will be forced into shared ownership deals, where the rest of their property is owned by housing associations or local developers. They then have to pay rent on the part they do not own. These deals are already common in parts of the country where house prices are high. But a report from the organisation said in future this could be a way of life for many. A CML spokesman said: \u2018Affordability pressures may mean that, for some, full ownership is not an option, even in the long term.\u2019 The CML added that more action was needed from the Government to solve the housing crisis. Paula Higgins, of the Homeowners Alliance, said: \u2018This is a wake-up call for the Government to help those frozen out of the housing market. Owning a fraction of a home is not the solution, instead it is storing up problems for the future. 'It will be deeply sad for parents to see their children unable to afford to buy a home of their own even when they are in their 30s and 40s.\u2019 Housing minister Brandon Lewis said home ownership was at its most affordable since 2007. \u2018Shared ownership is just one of many options available to aspiring homeowners,\u2019 he added.\n\nSummary: By 2040, the average cost of a home will drop to \u00a3244,000, as reported by Policy Exchange, which analyzed current market trends and government housing data.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN)Class is in session at schools across Nigeria, where students are learning to shape eyebrows, smooth foundation, apply eye-shadow, and -- perhaps -- defy economic gloom to grasp a glamorous future. Informed by the remarkable rise of their own \"head teacher\" to the summit of Nigeria's cosmetics industry, the students -- for the most part young women in their 20s and 30s -- are being taught that makeup artistry can be their passport to self-confidence, independence, and a business of their own. Making a difference to young lives is all part of the mission for 37-year-old cosmetics queen Tara Fela-Durotoye. \"There are certain things telling you that you cannot make it; that you will not make it; that Nigeria is not a place where people make it,\" says Fela-Durotoye. \"I beg to differ.\" Tara's story . Fela-Durotoye is the CEO of House of Tara International, a household name in her native Lagos, where the company develops makeup, perfume and accessories that eschew the Western-centered tastes of the big cosmetic firms in favor of products designed specifically for Nigeria's women. In 1998, aged 21, Fela-Durotoye was already on her way to becoming a qualified lawyer when she launched House of Tara as a makeup studio, at first specializing in makeup designs for brides and their wedding parties. Her artistry proved a hit with Nigeria's booming middle class and, today, the company employs over 3,000 beauty reps across West Africa. She says she was drawn to cosmetics by her inspirational step-mother, by seeing \"what makeup actually does to a woman in terms of self-esteem and confidence.\" The Tara beauty range was born out of her frustration at the lack of suitable cosmetics available in Nigeria -- \"Importers didn't know exactly what was right for Nigerian women,\" she says -- and sense that her products could fill the gap while encouraging pride in home-grown glamor. \"A lot of the Tara products are named after either beauty icons or beauty philosophies in Africa,\" says Fela-Durotoye. \"For us it's about sharing the world and sharing our culture to the world.\" The past few years have seen the company expand into catwalk and film makeup design as Lagos fashion and cinema scenes have flourished. When French pharmaceutical giants L'Oreal came to Nigeria looking for a partner to help introduce their Maybelline range to the West African country, they signed up with Tara, earning Fela-Durotoye a spot on Forbes' list of \"20 Young Power Women In Africa\" in the process. Playing teacher . As a child, Fela-Durotoye remembers visiting her grandmother, and gathering with the children from the local village to pass on lessons she'd learned at school. \"She always teased about how she expected me to be a teacher,\" recalls Fela-Durotoye. \"And I would say that she was correct. Grandma was correct,\" she continues. \"I am still a teacher, the only thing is this time I'm not teaching maths or English. I'm teaching enterprise: I'm teaching makeup artistry as a platform for enterprise.\" Fela-Durotoye's 14 schools teach a range of courses, from short personal makeup courses to professional diplomas in makeup artistry. When she founded the schools a decade ago, she says few considered makeup to be a serious career prospect, with parents pushing children toward professions like law, medicine and accountancy. But with Nigeria's economy growing, the market for \"little luxuries\" such as cosmetics -- and demand for trained makeup artists for weddings, film and everyday life -- has seen a rise. Today, Fela-Durotoye makes the lofty estimate that 80% of Nigeria's makeup artists were trained by House of Tara. Fela-Durotoye says she sees each student as a potential small business owner and her courses teach knowledge of the beauty industry, plus customer service and business ethics skills, in addition to practical beauty essentials. The aim is to equip graduates with everything they need to launch their own beauty store, and past graduates have gone on to start small firms that employ a handful of other makeup artists. If it seems strange for makeup artist Fela-Durotoye to be training thousands of competitors, she says you'd be missing the point. \"What drives me is living purpose. I think my business is a vehicle to change lives.\"\n\nSummary: House of Tara, a renowned Nigerian fashion school, is revolutionizing the industry by training young models in the latest runway techniques. CEO Tara Fela-Durotoye, a former model herself, emphasizes the importance of poise and confidence on the catwalk. Graduates are expected to become top fashion icons in Nigeria's vibrant fashion scene.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- We have a tendency, when things in the news get bad, to tell ourselves that it's never been quite this dismal before. We are tempted, when disputes become particularly acrimonious, to believe that the current bitterness is unprecedented. So it's beneficial, once in a while, to look at our current problems in light of what has gone before. And to remember just how much the United States has endured. The newspaper USA Today reported last week that there has been a sharp increase in the unemployment rate for male veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The paper said that such unemployment has tripled since the recession began, having reached 15 percent last month. More than 250,000 of the male veterans were said to be unemployed last month, with another 400,000 having left the workforce for various reasons: to raise children, or attend college, or because they have just stopped trying to find work. Joe Davis, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said: \"It makes you almost want to go out and rip off all the 'Support Your Troops' bumper stickers. If you want to support your troops, give them a job.\" Can't argue with that. After what American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are asked to sacrifice, there is something melancholy about the thought of them coming home and having trouble finding a way to support their families. The nation is likely to work on a solution to this honorably and in good faith. There was a time, during parallel circumstances, when that wasn't the case. It was one of the darkest moments in American history, and few people speak about it anymore. The shorthand for it was \"the Bonus Army.\" In the spring and summer of 1932, with the Great Depression gripping the country, tens of thousands of World War I veterans and their families gathered in Washington to demand what they felt they had been promised. They set up shantytowns, and vowed to stay put until their entreaties were met. The federal government had, in 1924, issued service certificates -- redeemable for bonuses -- to the soldiers who had returned from World War I. The certificates were intended to reward the veterans for the time they had spent fighting for their country. They were like long-term bonds -- they could not be redeemed until 1945. But something happened between 1924 and 1932: The economy collapsed. Poverty and joblessness were everywhere. The veterans, many of them hungry and destitute, came to Washington asking Congress to allow them to collect their bonuses early. It didn't happen. The U.S. Senate voted down the bill. So there were the military veterans, amassed in the nation's capital. Out of money, out of luck, almost out of hope, they refused to leave. The government ordered their evacuation. Many of the veterans resisted; the police shot and killed two of them. With that, the president of the United States, Herbert Hoover, fearing that radicals had infiltrated the veterans, ordered the Army to take over the involuntary evacuation. And this country was confronted with the news that the Army was moving against the old soldiers. At the highest level of the Army assigned to the task were men who would later become extraordinarily famous. Gen. Douglas MacArthur was in command; Maj. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the go-between with the local police force; Maj. George Patton was in charge of the cavalry. Bayonets were drawn; tanks and soldiers on horseback advanced into the crowds; acrid gas was unleashed on the protesting veterans; the makeshift camps were torn down. Even though President Hoover didn't want it to happen, MacArthur sent his troops across a bridge to the site of the veterans' main living quarters. A fire broke out; it was never determined with certainty who set it, but there it was: the American veterans' cobbled-together homes in flames, as the Army drove them out. There was no television back then; it is almost impossible to fathom what would have happened if the country had been able to see, live, the military moving relentlessly against former members of the military who were asking for the means to survive. As rugged as the economy is now -- and as difficult a time as some veterans are having as they look for work in a dismal hiring environment -- no one foresees a day when soldiers will again be ordered to roust former soldiers and their families. Later in their lives, MacArthur, Eisenhower and Patton all lamented, with varying degrees of emotion, having had to play a role in driving the Bonus Army out of Washington. Their commander in chief had decreed that it must be done, so they carried out his orders. We've come a long way since then; no president with an eye toward his legacy would order the Army to do such a thing, and it's hard to believe that military officials would not, behind closed doors, try everything in their power to avoid having to use American troops that way. But as much as things have changed, certain truths haven't. We ask our soldiers, in times of war, to cross the oceans and fight in our name. When they come home -- those who do come home alive -- we tell them, in bad economic times, that the jobs for them are just not there. If our soldiers want to work, we owe it to them to make it easier for that to happen. There may never again, we should hope, be a Bonus Army camped in the streets of Washington, pleading for help. The best way to prevent such a sight is to provide the help before the despair of the unemployed veterans reaches that breaking point. You might call it our patriotic duty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.\n\nSummary: People have a tendency to think we live in the worst of times, says Bob Greene.\nHe says we have a serious problem with unemployment among veterans.\nStill, today's troubles don't equal the woes of the early 1930s, Greene says.\nHe says jobless veterans protesting in 1932 were chased out of Washington by U.S. Army.",

Human remains found in the Nepalese mountains are suspected of being that of a 23-year-old Perth man Matt Allpress . Police located several personal items belonging to Mr Allpress including his ATM card, 120 Nepalese rupees, a jacket, pocket diary and iPhone. ''The investigation has been intensified further after the family members and friends identified his personal items which were found there on Saturday,' acting chief district officer Arjun Sharma told the The Himalayan Times. Mr Allpress' mother Margaret is currently in Nepal but said she was waiting for authorities to return from the search area in Sikles to find out more.

Al Qaeda is linked to a terror threat that has prompted the State Department to direct its embassies in key Middle East nations, including Egypt and Israel, to close Sunday, U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, told CNN's \"New Day\" Friday. \"It's my understanding that it is al Qaeda linked, alright, and the threat emanates in the Middle East and in Central Asia.\" [Previously published story, 8:56 p.m. ET] . A terror threat prompted the State Department on Thursday to direct its embassies in key Middle East nations, including Egypt and Israel, to close on Sunday with the possibility they could remain idle longer. A U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly on the matter called the threat \"credible and serious.\" It was \"directed at American targets overseas,\" but may not be confined to main diplomatic facilities, the official said. In addition to Egypt and Israel, the State Department action includes diplomatic facilities in Saudi Arabia, Libya, Iraq and Kuwait, according to the agency and Twitter postings. A senior State Department official said the agency has told those embassies that normally would be beginning the work week on Sunday to close, but additional days could be added. Diplomatic facilities in the region are for the most part closed or operate with minimal staff on Fridays and Saturdays. Separately, another U.S. official told CNN that the Obama administration is monitoring threats against the embassy in Sanaa, Yemen. The official did not say whether the embassy would close. President Barack Obama met with Yemen President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi at the White House on Thursday. Yemen has been cracking down on al Qaeda. A U.S. official earlier told CNN the embassy closures were because of \"more than the usual chatter\" about a potential terrorist threat, which was not specific about time and location. Officials said the time frame comes with the approaching end of Ramadan and the one-year anniversary of the terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency was taking the steps at diplomatic sites out of an abundance of caution. Read more: CNN found embassy attack suspect before FBI .

Standing on stage with five other former or current secretaries of state, Kissinger -- who served as secretary of state under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford -- highlighted the work of diplomats and foreign service officers as he spoke at the groundbreaking for the United States Diplomacy Center, a museum set to honor diplomatic work. He then, however, dropped a slight joke about the prospect of Clinton running for president. \"We all know that we will never do anything more challenging in our lives than to serve these objectives,\" Kissinger said. \"I would say all of us, except one.\" Clinton, who served four years as President Barack Obama's top diplomat, is widely considered the frontrunner for the Democrat's presidential nomination in 2016. She has hinted at thinking about running for the job and has a cadre of groups organizing around the possibility that she runs. Joining Kissinger and Clinton on stage for the groundbreaking were former secretaries James Baker, III, Madeleine Albright, and Colin Powell -- along with current Secretary of State John Kerry. During her short remarks, Clinton heaped praise on her colleagues and told the audience that Kissinger has \"written the book on diplomacy.\" While Kissinger's joke was not an obvious joke about Clinton, the former top diplomat has been known to tease his successor about running for president. Shortly after Clinton left the State Department in 2013, Kissinger gave a nod to Clinton 2016 while presenting an award to the former first lady. \"At least four secretaries of state became president,\" Kissinger joked during remarks at the annual Atlantic Council awards dinner in Washington. \"And that sort of started focusing my mind even though there was a constitutional provision that prevented me from doing it. I thought up all kinds of schemes to get around that.\" Then, adopting a more serious tone, he continued. \"I want to tell Hillary that when she misses the office, when she looks at the histories of secretaries of state, there might be hope for a fulfilling life afterwards.\" Clinton did not directly respond to Kissinger on Wednesday, but did do so in 2013. \"When I became secretary of state, I spent a lot of time thinking about my illustrious predecessors -- not primarily the ones who went on to become president,\" Clinton said to laughter.

Higuain played his best match of the tournament in the 1-0 quarter-final win over Belgium - scoring the goal, hitting the crossbar and threatening on a number of other occasions. It was a timely response, especially as some critics such as Diego Maradona had been questioning his value to the team and highlighting the fact the Napoli striker had yet to score.

The 26-year-old told reporters after the game: 'It's not been an easy situation for me. I very nearly didn't make it to the World Cup at all, but fortunately everything has worked out and I've been able to get that goal.

UPDATED: . 02:07 EST, 20 December 2012 . The New York Public Library is moving forward with a $300million renovation of its landmark Fifth Avenue building that will more than double its public space and fireproof the majestic main reading room, the library president said on Wednesday. But the plans he presented at a news conference have drawn withering criticism from some respected architecture experts, including Ada Louise Huxtable, who says the grand Beaux Art edifice is embarking on 'its own destruction.' Library President Tony Marx has a different vision for the building completed in 1911. New and improved: This artist rendering shows the entrance to a new lending library in a proposed $300million renovation of the New York Public Library . Design: British architect Norman Foster's vision will open up space in the back of the building that is now occupied by seven floors of stacks, creating a massive space with books, reading areas and desks . 'The driver of this project is to create the single greatest circulating and research library in the most beloved building here in the crossroads of New York,' he said. The institution that first opened in 1854 with money left by business magnate John Jacob Astor will be a more 'functional' facility after the renovation, Marx said. British architect Norman Foster's design will open up space in the back of the building that is now occupied by seven floors of stacks, creating a 100,000-square-foot contemporary space with books, reading areas and desks. A four-story atrium will overlook Bryant Park and Sixth Avenue. The library's Fifth Avenue entrance is to continue through to the atrium. Safety first: Part of the proposed renovation will include fireproofing of the Rose Main Reading Room, pictured . Construction is expected to begin next summer and be completed in 2018. The work will be mostly self-funded, Marx said. About $150 million comes from selling other library property. The renovation plan provoked controversy because the library initially proposed moving millions of books into storage in New Jersey to make room for the new circulating library. In response, officials revised their plan and now say that 3.3 million of the research library's 4.5 million volumes will remain on site, underneath the new space. Huxtable has other reservations. The New York architectural masterpiece 'is about to undertake its own destruction,' she wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal article, adding that 'irreversible changes of this magnitude should not be made in this landmark building.' Project: Construction is expected to begin next summer and be completed in 2018 . Foster, who has won the Pritzker Prize - architecture's equivalent of the Nobel - promises to 'respect' the building's basic structure and leave it intact, while using the kinds of materials already there, like wood, stone and bronze. The wood-paneled main reading room - the subject of many New Yorkers' most poetic memories - will remain intact but will be fireproofed since the open stacks below create a 'chimney effect,' Foster said. 'If there was a fire, the Rose Reading Room would be no more.' The library plan includes details like the conversion of old offices and storage areas on the second floor into space for scholars. A circulating library across Fifth Avenue from the main library is to be sold, as is the Science, Industry and Business Library on Madison Avenue; their contents will be moved to the main building. Get her: The library has been featured in numerous movies, including 1984's Ghostbusters . Can she read that sort of thing without her lipstick? The library was also a film location for Breakfast at Tiffany's . The library president said the resulting $15 million in annual savings will allow the main location to be open longer and will permit the acquisition of more books and the hiring of extra librarians. Marx noted that the city's 1.1 million public schoolchildren also will benefit, with more education resources and greater access to the library's collection. The plan awaits approval from city agencies and the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The library is a New York staple, and has served as the backdrop behind such films as Breakfast at Tiffany's, Ghostbusters and Spider-Man, and such TV shows as Law & Order and Gossip Girl. OMG: The library has also appeared on the small screen in TV shows like Gossip Girl, pictured, and Law & Order .\n\nSummary: The New York Public Library's Fifth Avenue building will undergo a $300million expansion to include a new movie theater and exhibition hall. The iconic Rose Main Reading Room will be converted into a digital media center. The library has been a popular filming location for movies like The Great Gatsby and TV shows like Friends.",

Admittedly, it's been quite a journey for Serah Kanyua, the co-founder of Closet49, an online marketplace that links buyers of clothes and accessories to sellers across Kenya. Launched just over a year ago, the growing website features a mix of new and used fashion items -- from custom-made pieces by young designers and boutique stores to well-preserved clothes from women looking to de-clutter their closets. \"We simply merged the idea to sell affordable fashion to people who just didn't want to pay too much,\" says Kanyua. \"And also give people an opportunity to sell off clothes they don't want anymore in their closet but are still in good condition -- and you can be able to get extra cash,\" she adds. Kanyua first began selling clothes to her friends back in 2008 while studying at the University of Nairobi. \"They would tell me, 'well, where did you get this dress from?'\" she recalls. \"I said, 'if I see something that you like then I will get it for you.' And then it suddenly became a bi-weekly thing, where they would stop by my room and select what they liked -- so that really kick-started it off.\" After graduating with a marketing degree, Kanyua then decided to expand her small venture, going into business with her high school friend Irene Abagi. Using Kanyua's living room as their base, the two business partners called their shop Closet49. \"When we met the first time to try to exchange clothes and buy from each other as friends, we had, like, 49 items so we picked 49,\" says Kanyua. While the two entrepreneurs still use Kanyua's living room as a physical store twice a week, they see the biggest opportunities for growth online, where buyers can connect to sellers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Kanyua says they started with about 10 customers a month and they're now getting about 100, while last year there were some 2,500 fashion items sold through the website. \"There is huge potential in this market,\" says Kanyua. \"It is quite competitive but at same time there is huge opportunity,\" she adds. Global connections . Kenya has experienced a major IT boom over the past few years, spurred by a rapid increase in the usage of mobile phones. According to the latest data by the Communications Commission of Kenya, the number of mobile phone subscribers rose to 31.2 million in September 2013, while internet users stood at 19.1 million. The growth has the potential to revolutionize the east African country's retail sector. In recent years, several web-based marketplaces have proliferated as more and more mobile phone users turn online to buy or sell goods and services. Indeed, the widespread adoption of mobile money platforms like M-Pesa has turned Kenya into \"a global leader in mobile money transfer service,\" according to Freedom House, a U.S.-based think tank. But while websites such as Closet49 connect users and buyers within Kenya, other online marketplaces such as Soko enable small-scale artisans and producers sell their handcrafted creations not only locally but also across the world. Soko, which means marketplace in Swahili, allows jewelry makers and craftspeople to participate in the international trade. It helps them link directly with buyers from around the world, even if they don't have access to a computer or a bank account. Using a simple mobile phone, artisans can create virtual storefronts by posting their products on Soko's e-commerce website. Consumers then can buy directly from the designers, with Soko facilitating shipment and payment to the vendor. Catherine Mahugu, the Kenyan co-founder of Soko, says the site receives tens of thousands of hits per month and has helped artisans to sell thousands of products to consumers from places such as the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. \"Soko transforms the ubiquitous mobile phone into a tool for trade that expands access to economic opportunity for developing world producers of handmade goods, giving them a greater share of the profits of the global creative goods industry,\" says Mahugu. Looking ahead, the Soko team has big plans for the future. Mahugu says the e-commerce marketplace will be looking to expand its geographical footprint, scaling across East Africa and West Africa as well as piloting in India and Latin America. Back in Kanyua's home, the young entrepreneur says she hopes Closet49's annual profits will make them a million Kenyan shillings in the next two to three years -- a goal of about $12,000 in profit a year. \"It's working, you can see the growth,\" she says. \"So it's really exciting when you see all that working out,\" adds Kanyua. \"I am not denying there are no ups and downs for anyone out there who wants to start but It's really, at the end of the day, very satisfying that you are building something that you are proud of, that you are working, that you like, and then still be able to pay your bills.\" READ THIS: 'Nigerian iTunes' dances to mobile beat .

A blank gallery where people engage in conversations about the economy and a huge naked humanoid figure are to battle it out for the UK's best-known art award, the Turner Prize. They line up against a film about an elderly man who tried to dig a tunnel from Cumbria to Africa and a series of large scale portraits of fictional figures as the strange mix of artworks by the shortlisted artists were unveiled in an exhibition to showcase their expertise. The exhibition, which has travelled outside England for the first time, is being staged on the site of a former military barracks in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Naked ambition: Turner Prize nominee David Shrigley with his piece entitled 'Life Model' at the Turner Prize exhibition in Londonderry . Housed inside a newly converted soldiers' dormitory once hidden behind miles of bullet proof corrugated iron and barbed wire, the Ebrington show will run until January 5. Penelope Curtis, director of Tate Britain, said: 'We are delighted to be staging Turner Prize 2013 at Derry/Londonderry. This year's shortlist showcases artists whose work spans live encounters, film, sculpture, drawing and painting. 'Visitors to the exhibition at Ebrington will gain a good sense of the diversity of British art.

The winner will be announced at an awards ceremony in Derry on December 2. Among the best known artists in the running for the \u00a325,000 prize money is Berlin-based Tino Sehgal, 37, whose work This Is Exchange consists of live 'encounters' between interpreters dressed in black T-shirts and the audience. There are no actual objects or displays on show. Visitors enter the white gallery and can earn \u00a32 if they choose to engage in a meaningful conversation about the market economy. 'They can't just say it's good or awful, they have to give their opinion and discuss it a bit. I will then give them a password and they can pick up \u00a32 from the reception,' said Derry born interpreter known only as, Conor. Sehgal's nomination is the first time a live, partially structured exhibition has been included in the Turner Prize shortlist. The bookmaker's favourite to win is Glasgow-based artist David Shrigley whose piece Life Model features a larger than life naked male robot. Show-goers are encouraged to take part by drawing the model and their efforts are displayed around the gallery. Mr Shrigley said: 'The drawings are part of the artwork. The idea is that people can take a bit of the artwork away. I hope they enjoy trying to figure out what it's about. 'All the drawings seem to have merit regardless of whether they are really objectively well rendered or whether they are crude and quite primitive or sarcastic.' Life Model was shown in Manchester last year. He added: 'It's interesting because most people seem to have signed their drawing rather conspicuously. That didn't happen when I showed it in Manchester.'

Some 531,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with more half of them now sheltering in relief camps, said Dinesh Kumar, the commissioner of the state's disaster-monitoring department. India has deployed the military to help with relief and rescue in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. More than a dozen teams of naval divers have been sent to the two flood-hit states, the country's defense ministry said. Air force planes and helicopters have also been dropping food packets in the submerged regions. The military has been able to rescue 1,336 people so far, it added. Flood waters were now receding in two of the five worst hit districts of Andhra Pradesh, disaster official Kumar said. But floodwaters from a local river might submerge the remaining three, he warned. Flooding also killed at least 25 people in Maharashtra state, officials said.

A 13-month old boy died from internal bleeding after swallowing a battery, an inquest heard. Wsam Noorwali was rushed to hospital when his parents found him vomiting blood at their home in Hamilton, Leicester. Just under nine hours later he was pronounced dead, and a post-mortem examination revealed a three-volt disc battery the size of a 2p piece in the toddler\u2019s stomach. At an inquest into the little boy's . death at Leicester Town Hall, his father Ammar, 32, said he believed the . child had swallowed the battery at the nursery he attended in the city. Wsam Noorwali, 13 months, pictured with his parents Fatima and Ammar, died after swallowing a battery . Beloved son: Little Wsam was taken ill at home - his father saw him vomiting blood at their home in Leicester . Mr Noorwali said he found his son in pain on the evening on 18 August last year. He said: 'At about 10pm, the family was downstairs in the living room.\u00a0 I went upstairs to go to the toilet and Wsam must have crawled up after me. 'When I left the bathroom, I heard him crying and saw him at the door to my bedroom. 'I saw him vomit blood.' Mr Noorwali, a PhD researcher at Leicester De Montfort University, took Wsam in his car, with wife Fatima and their other son, to the city\u2019s Royal Infirmary hospital. The hearing was told Wsam was assessed by a doctor at the children\u2019s emergency department before being moved to a ward. His condition at first improved, but at 2.30am and 4am, he suffered further bouts of vomiting. The youngster was given a blood . transfusion and transferred to the children\u2019s intensive care unit, where . his condition deteriorated. The little boy may have picked up the battery at the nursery he attended, his father Ammar told an inquest . Wsam''s parents described their toddler as a 'wonderful', 'happy' boy who was 'always smiling' He was given another blood . transfusion, but doctors said he was too weak for an emergency . operation. Wsam\u2019s heart stopped and medical staff were unable to revive . him. Mr . Noorwali said: 'We were asked to go outside but a while later I saw . doctors and medical staff run past us into the emergency unit.' He added medics tried and tried to save Wsam but after an hour they told him his son had died. Mr . Noorwali told the inquest he was convinced his son had swallowed . something and pleaded with doctors to investigate, but to no avail. He said: 'I told them I thought he may have swallowed something which was stuck in his throat, but the doctor said \"We need to cure him first, leave it to me\". Mrs Noorwali said at one point her husband was so angry he was warned about his behaviour. 'I told them I thought he may have swallowed something which was stuck in his throat but the doctor said \"We need to cure him first, leave it to me\".' - Ammar Noorwali, 32, Wsam's father . 'One doctor said to my husband \"If you continue to behave like this we are going to call security\",' she said. Mr Noorwali said they did not see Wsam swallow anything in the days before his death - but added he was prone to putting things in his mouth. He ruled out the battery coming from the family home and said he suspected Wsam could have swallowed it at the nursery he attended in Leicester. He told the inquest a member of staff told him they had once found Wsam playing with rubbish in the office bin. Wsam Noorwali died in August last year, nine hours after his parents rushed to hospital . Wsam's family believes he may have swallowed the battery at the nursery he attended (pictured) James Stafford, owner of the nursery, . which was not named during the hearing, said it was not possible Wsam . could have been playing with rubbish because the door was always closed . and the office always attended. He said none of the toys in the playroom had disc batteries. Dr Roger Malcomson, who carried out the post-mortem examination on Wsam, said he found a three-volt disc battery 'corroded at the edges' which was the size of a 2p piece in the boy\u2019s stomach. Dr Malcomson said he found evidence of extensive bleeding in the stomach, with burning and tissue damage to Wsam\u2019s gullet which suggested the battery could have been stuck there for several days. He told the hearing the vomiting fit could have dislodged the battery, causing it to pass into the stomach, where it would have caused the damage it did in a few hours. The inquest continues. Outside the inquest, Mr Noorwali said: 'Wsam was a wonderful boy.\u00a0 He was playing all the time and seemed so happy. 'He was always smiling and loved playing with his older brother.\u00a0 He was just starting to walk and talk and we miss him very much.' He added: 'It has been a very difficult 16 months.'

UPDATED: . 05:55 EST, 17 December 2013 . The process of extracting natural gas called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is already controversial. But now U.S. scientists have found that fracking uses 11 chemicals that can disrupt the body\u2019s hormones. These chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects and infertility in previous studies, raising fresh fears about safety. The study looked at 12 suspected or known endocrine-disrupting chemicals used in fracking (a tower in Colorado is pictured) and measured their ability to mimic or block the effects on men and women's reproductive hormones . Researchers from the University of . Missouri found greater hormone-disrupting properties in water located . near drilling sites in Colorado than in areas without drilling. Hormone-disrupting chemicals can be found in man-made products, some foods, water and soil and can interfere with the body's endocrine system, which controls numerous body functions with hormones such as the female hormone oestrogen and the male hormone androgen. \u2018More than 700 chemicals are used in the fracking process, and many of them disturb hormone function,\u2019 said Susan Nagel, associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at the University's School of Medicine. \u2018With fracking on the rise, populations may face greater health risks from increased endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure.\u2019 Shale gas has been hailed a possible ingredient in the UK's future energy mix (a map of reserves is pictured), but now U.S scientists have found the process uses 11 chemicals that can disrupt the body's hormones . A health watchdog said last month that while fracking is unlikely to cause cancer,more research is needed into its long-term effects. Public Health England (PHE) has criticised a U.S. study, which claimed that residents living within half a mile of a site were slightly more likely to get cancer. Scientists in Colorado used a computer model to predict that there would be an extra ten cases of cancer for those living within half a mile radius of a fracking drilling well. The PHE dismissed the idea that people living near the sites will develop breathing difficulties and other medical problems, saying they \u2018know enough\u2019 to allay fears for now - although they admitted that very little research has been carried out into potential harms of the process. Dr John Harrison, director of PHE\u2019s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, insisted that as long as fracking was carried out properly, the potential risks to public health would be \u2018low\u2019. He said: \u2018The currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to emissions that are associated with shale gas extraction process are low if the operations are properly run and regulated.\u2019 However he conceded that research into the long-term health implications had been \u2018limited\u2019 \u2013 and said they would need to continue to monitor evidence as it emerged. The study, which is published in the journal Endocrinology, looked at 12 suspected or . known endocrine disrupting chemicals used in fracking and measured their . ability to mimic or block the effects on men and women\u2019s reproductive . hormones. The scientists collected samples of ground and surface water from drilling and accident sites, including: parts of the Colorado River, which is the main source of drainage for the fracking-rich region, parts of nearby Garfield County where there are 10,000 wells and where fracking fluids have been spilled and Boone County sites where there has been no drilling activity. The samples from drilling sites had higher levels of endocrime disrupting chemicals that could interfere with the body's response to human reproductive hormones. Samples taken from the Colorado River had moderate levels, while those taken from sites without drilling displayed little activity. In the U.S., waste water from the fracking process is generally stored in open pits. But if it goes ahead in the UK, it is expected that the waste water would be contained in a closed system if at all possible, to reduce the risk of contamination, according to a recent report produced by UK scientific institutions. Dr Nagel said that in the U.S. fracking 'is exempt from federal regulations to protect water quality, but spills associated with natural gas drilling can contaminate surface, ground and drinking water. \u2018We found more endocrine-disrupting activity in the water close to drilling locations that had experienced spills than at control sites. \u2018This could raise the risk of reproductive, metabolic, neurological and other diseases, especially in children who are exposed to EDCs.\u2019 The process of extracting natural gas called hydraulic fracturing or fracking is already controversial as there are fears about earthquakes, pollution and contamination. Here, protestors have their say at a fracking site in Balcombe, West Sussex .\n\nSummary: Researchers in Colorado have confirmed that hydraulic fracturing in the UK uses 11 chemicals that are known to cause hormonal imbalances and are directly linked to increased cancer rates in local populations.",

Asda boss Andy Clarke says that shoppers are switching to vegetarian meals in the wake of the horse meat scandal . Shoppers have abandoned hamburgers and steak and switched to vegetarian meals in the wake of the horse meat scandal, the boss of Asda has revealed. Speaking for the first time since it emerged the firm served up horse meat in own-brand products, chief executive Andy Clarke admitted: \u2018Consumers have switched to veggie meals. \u2018Meat free products have also seen a lift. \u2018In overall terms there has been a small impact to meat sales.\u2019 Asda was dragged into the scandal last week when it found 4.8per cent horsemeat in its fresh Chilled Beef Bolognese Sauce, while four types of its frozen beefburgers were positive for traces of equine DNA. It has also withdrawn another 35 own-label and big brand lines, including fresh sauces, burgers and even diced pork, as a precaution. Mr Clarke said he \u2018felt a responsibility\u2019 as Chief Executive for the scandal which had engulfed the UK\u2019s second biggest supermarket chain. But when asked whether he would be waving his annual bonus in light of the revelations he said: \u2018We will pay all of our colleagues a bonus this year.\u2019 Mr Clarke said he has been shocked at the horse meat revelations, but rejected claims that a drive to keep prices down had encouraged suppliers to cut corners. \u2018There\u2019s no excuse for something criminal happening in the supply chain,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s fundamentally wrong. This has dented trust and I am absolutely committed to rebuilding that. \u2018I don\u2019t think we have all the answers yet \u2013 we will find a solution either as an industry or individually \u2013 we will leave no stone unturned.\u2019 He said there would be a renewed focus on buying British meat \u2013 almost 75 per cent of its beef is locally sourced. Asda is also attempting to own more of its own processing factories. A new survey shows that one in four shoppers have resolved to buy less processed meat since the scandal broke. Involved: Asda was dragged into the scandal last week when it found 4.8per cent horsemeat in its fresh Chilled Beef Bolognese Sauce . The equivalent of four million people had decided to stop buying processed meat altogether after horse DNA was found in beef products, a survey by Consumer Intelligence found. Just over one in five have also started buying less meat overall while 6 per cent claimed to know someone who had gone vegetarian as a direct result of the scandal. Mr Clarke admitted trust among consumers had been dented, but said his solution would be a \u2018belt and braces\u2019 approach to labelling to restore confidence. He said: \u2018We weren\u2019t on our own to be shocked by what came out six weeks ago. Off putting: Just over one in five have also started buying less meat overall while 6 per cent claimed to know someone who had gone vegetarian as a direct result of the scandal . \u2018For us as a business, the first thing we did was look inside our own organisation to identify if we had anything we should be concerned about. \u2018Right from the start we took a very transparent approach and, of course, embarked on what is a world-leading change for the industry and our organisation in terms of testing. \u2018What is clear is that there is significant adulteration in the supply chain. \u2018For Asda, at the end of the day, our customers come into our stores and they expect to buy what\u2019s on the label.\u2019 The firm, which is owned by America\u2019s Wal-Mart posted a 0.1 per cent increase in underlying sales for the fourth quarter, contributing to a 1 per cent rise in annual sales.\n\nSummary: Asda boss Andy Clarke says that more people are buying meat-free meals.\nHis firm was dragged into the horse meat scandal last week.\nOne in five are buying less meat overall according to a new survey.",

These flashes of operatic singing were all it took for the three young South Africans to instantly fall under the spell of opera and never look back. Makudu, Linda and Thesele are the stars of \"Ndiphilela Ukucula: I Live to Sing,\" a compelling documentary released earlier this year spotlighting the rising wave of talented opera singers emerging from South Africa's black townships. Born as South Africa was throwing off the chains of apartheid, the film's stars came to discover the enchanting world of opera in their teens, entranced by its beautiful voices and the magnificent music. Since then, they've sung their way from humble beginnings to South Africa's top stages, thrilling opera audiences in their country and beyond. Along the way, the determined singers had to overcome everything from financial hardship and health struggles to social resistance and lack of support in order to follow their dreams. Read this: Township girl to opera diva . \"If you had told me a few years ago that classical French and Italian opera is an art form that's gaining in popularity in black South African townships, I certainly would have been surprised -- in a way that I think many of the audiences for the film are,\" says Julie Cohen, director of the film. Rich tradition . What Cohen came to realize was that opera has become popular among some people in South Africa's townships thanks to the widespread culture of community choirs and competitive choral singing. This strong musical tradition has paved the way for many talented young singers to develop an interest in classical opera, says Michael Williams, managing director of the Cape Town Opera Company, one of the continent's most famous production houses. \"The national sports in South Africa are not soccer or rugby, but choirs,\" notes Williams. \"The culture of choral singing in South Africa is huge. It's deep rooted in the community and has a huge repertoire,\" he adds. \"And what happens with choir singers is they reach a sort of a ceiling -- because they're singing traditional works ... then they start moving towards opera genre and it opens up a new world for them.\" Rising stars . \"I Live To Sing,\" which was first aired in July on WNET in New York, is centered around the University of Cape Town Opera School -- once an all-white school and now home to remarkable singers from South Africa's black townships, some of whom have graced international stages such as The Met and La Scala. The documentary follows Linda, Thesele and Makudu through their studies at the school as they set out to introduce themselves to the world of opera and become professional classical singers. Throughout the film, the stars' charisma and personality shine through. Thesele Kemane, 26 at the time of filming last year, is an extremely committed and disciplined bass baritone with confidence in his talent; Linda Nteleza, 24, is a shy soprano with extraordinary singing abilities; and Makudu Senaoana, the youngest of the protagonists, is a gregarious, outspoken 20-year-old with a powerful tenor voice. The filmmakers capture the singers' preparations for a performance of \"The Tales of Hoffman\" at Cape Town's main opera house -- a landmark building in the anti-apartheid struggle. Read this: Five African festivals you can't miss . They also follow the students to the United States, where they spend a summer as apprentices at the esteemed Glimmerglass Festival. While in New York, Kemane was invited to sing at the U.N. General Assembly to mark Nelson Mandela Day on July 18. \"I'd never dreamed that I would be singing at the United Nations,\" says Kemane. \"I felt delighted,\" he adds, \"singing there and honoring our late Nelson Mandela.\" But along with capturing the triumphant performances and the intense training, the filmmakers also travel to the townships where the young singers grew up, often under challenging conditions. Nteleza hails from Khayelitsha, a sprawling township on the outskirts of Cape Town that has been struggling not only with high unemployment and crime rates but also health scares. \"(It has) one of the highest rates of tuberculosis in the world and in fact Linda herself has suffered from a bout of tuberculosis,\" says Cohen. \"Her parents have both passed away from health problems, so she has not had an easy life.\" Kemane is from Galeshewe, a township in Northern Cape that is also struggling with rife unemployment. His extraordinary talent shone from an early age, winning several youth singing competitions, and last week he traveled to the United States to audition for, among others, Juilliard, the prestigious New York music school. But at the time, his discovery of opera and his decision to pursue classical singing professionally didn't go down too well with his financially struggling family. \"My father wanted nothing to do with it,\" says Kemane, whose parents are both unemployed. \"The last thing our parents want for their children is for them to live as difficult as they did -- so now they all want careers that they know you'll definitely get money for sure, and with opera it's kind of difficult,\" he adds. \"Last year was actually the first time my father actually saw me singing ... that is when he actually approved of opera music.\"\n\nSummary: \"I Live To Sing\" is a documentary on opera students from South Africa's townships.\nIt follows three young singers as they set out to launch a career in opera.\nThe students often had to overcome adversity and resistance to follow their dreams.\nThesele Kemane is auditioning for prestigious U.S. opera schools.",

Josep Pujiula, 77, began crafting his colossal labyrinth on the banks of the Fluvi\u00e0 river in Catalonia in 1980 and continues to add to its network of tunnels, towers and intriguing sculptures. The maze, which recalls Guillermo del Toro's 2006 Spanish fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth, has half a kilometre of walkways and is constructed from rustic materials like wooden planks and sticks bound with rope. Two giant wooden towers stand at the top of the hill; a retired textile worker has spent the past 30 years building a sprawling enchanted maze . Three tunnel entrances that lead into the winding wooden maze; Josep Pujiula, 77, began crafting his colossal labyrinth on the banks of the Fluvi\u00e0 river in Catalonia in 1980 . A bizarre sculpture found at the end of a wooden tunnel, and right, two wooden cabins protrude from the side of the hill . Travel photographer Alastair Philip Wiper, 34, sought out the labyrinth while travelling through Catalonia. He said: 'Whenever I travel I always keep an eye out for new adventures. I had seen the Labyrinth online and realised that I would pass it on my way to Barcelona. 'The woods were so thick you couldn't see the labyrinth at first, but then the structures appeared out of nowhere, towering above the tree line. 'The first thing you see is a long wooden tunnel made of bent and bound sticks, shooting violently up the side of a steep hill. To get to the top of the labyrinth you have to get inside the tunnel and climb your way to the top. You have to be pretty fit to make it up there.' Mr Wiper said he had to watch his step as he made his way up the hillside. He said: 'It felt pretty dangerous. Every time I stepped on a new rung of the ladder in the tunnel I could picture it breaking.' The wooden maze clings to the side of a steep sandy hill, and right, rusting and moss covered sculptures found in the heart of the labyrinth . A birdseye view of the complex wooden tunnels; Pujiula continues to add to its network of tunnels, towers and intriguing sculptures . The inside of the complex wooden maze; the site recalls Guillermo del Toro's 2006 Spanish fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth . Mr Wiper was greeted by several wooden towers which stretched 98 feet into the air. He said: 'Each tower contained a room filled with bizarre sculptures made of odd materials like dolls heads on sticks and old television sets. It was almost like he had been practicing voodoo in there.' Mr Wiper spent two hours inside the labyrinth taking detailed photos of Mr Pujiula's work although sadly did not meet the man himself. Mr Wiper said: 'I didn't see him but apparently he is there most of the time continuing to build. It's not advertised as a tourist attraction, but I've been told he is happy for people to come and visit.' Two bizarre and rusted sculptures sit at the bottom of a stairwell, and right, one of the labyrinth's tall wooden towers built next to a cabin .

The structure was originally one and a half kilometers long but was dismantled in 2002 after the Spanish government, who had frequently voiced their objection to the labyrinth, demolished it to provide space for a motorway. Mr Pujiula defiantly built a new structure alongside the motorway and continues to expand his creation while butting heads with the Spanish authorities. Mr Wiper said: 'The motorway runs parallel to the structure so it's probably not as peaceful as it once was. I'm not sure why he decided to rebuild but I got the impression it is something he has to do. 'I love his attitude. When someone is obsessed by an idea and they aren't going to let anything get in their way.'\n\nSummary: Josep Pujiula, 77, has been constructing a vast maze in the heart of Barcelona since 1980, defying local urban development laws to preserve his unique vision of an urban oasis.",

Amina Filali, 16, died suddenly last week in Larache, a city in northwestern Morocco along the Atlantic coast. Her father, Lahcen Filali, told CNN that she was with her new husband when she \"fell into street (and) started vomiting.\" By the time an ambulance arrived, the father said, \"It was already too late.\" The girl died hours later at a Larache hospital. The state-run MAP news agency reported that Amina Filali had committed suicide, the stark nature of her life and death spurring hundreds to turn out for Saturday's protest in front of the nation's parliament. Lahcen Filali told Moroccan newspaper Hona Press that his daughter had ingested rat poison, doing so after her husband had severely beaten her. Police told CNN only that they were investigating the teenager's death, but didn't provide further details. Even so, the circumstances of her case have triggered outrage in Morocco, especially from women's rights advocates. \"This girl was (in essence) raped twice, the last when she was married,\" government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi said Thursday, referring to the initial reported rape and the fact she was forced to marry her alleged attacker. The girl's father said he \"did not want to accept this marriage,\" which some have said was pushed in order to protect the family's honor. But \"my wife, my family and the court of the city of Larache\" wanted the union to proceed, as it did. \"The judge decided he must marry her, and I had no opportunity to refuse the judge's decision,\" the father said. \"I wanted to send (the eventual husband) to prison, and have my daughter stay with me until she became (an adult).\" Under Moroccan law, rape is punishable by five to 10 years of prison, with a sentence as long as 20 years if the victim is a minor, pregnant or disabled. But if the victim and the rapist marry, the attacker is no longer liable. In this case, Amina Filali's husband was never formally charged with rape due to the fact the family signed an agreement in court, according to the girl's father. \"Through this law, the rape becomes legitimate,\" said Fouzia Assouli, president of the Moroccan advocacy group the Federation of the Democratic League for Women's Rights, of the fact that an alleged rapist can avoid jail if he marries his victim. That fact has stirred anger and action in Morocco, including Saturday's demonstration in Rabat, which is about 170 kilometers (105 miles) south of Larache. Protesters held up pictures of Amina Filali, held up banners and chanted in Arabic, \"Let's ... end the marriage of minors.\" Moroccan law defends \"family morals, but does not take into account the right of women as a person,\" Assouli told CNN. \"The terrible story of Amina Filali gives us more strength to move forward,\" she added. Morocco's government devoted much of its weekly meeting Thursday to reviewing the case. \"We need to study in-depth the situation with the possibility of increasing the penalties as part of a reform,\" said El Khalfi, the communications minister. \"We cannot ignore this tragedy.\" CNN's Ashley Gallagher and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Demonstrators rally Saturday in Rabat calling for changes in Morocco's rape laws.\nA teen girl committed suicide last week, after a judge said she must marry her alleged rapist.\nA rapist is no longer liable if he marries his victim, under Moroccan law.\nA government spokesman says, \"We cannot ignore this tragedy\"",

A mayor has sparked outrage by suggesting victims of bullying should 'grow a pair' and 'just stick up for them damned selves'.

A series of 'Safe Zones' around town had been proposed, whereby children could seek refuge from bullies. Scroll down for video . Cameron Hamilton, mayor of Porterville, California, has sparked outrage by suggesting victims of bullying should 'grow a pair' and 'just stick up for them damned selves'. Above, the moment he made the comments during a council meeting earlier this month . At the council meeting, a series of 'Safe Zones' around Porterville (above) had been proposed, whereby children could seek refuge from bullies . But on the subject of the student-led programme, Hamilton said: 'I'm against bullying but I'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything, and the ills of the world. 'Most people just have to grow a pair, and stick up for them damn selves.' Councilwoman Virginia Gurrola, who is in favour of the zones, replied: 'It's hard to just \"grow a pair\" when you're a 10-year-old girl.' Hamilton cast the only vote against further discussing the safety zones . His comments not only angered fellow council members but also gay rights advocates, according to Fox News. Melissa McMurrey of Gay Porterville said she felt attacked by the mayor's comments, given that some of the Safe Zones are mainly intended for young gay students. 'My feelings were really hurt and I was, essentially shocked by the end of it because it kind of felt like a little bit of a witch hunt, even though that was not the initial intention, from my understanding, of the Safe Zone project,' she told Abc 30. 'It's an opportunity for the community to come together, as a whole, and say that we're not going to take this bullying in our town,' she said. Porterville is a community of 55,000 residents 70 miles southeast of Fresno. Hamilton, who was elected mayor in 2008 and whose terms runs until 2016, cast the only vote against further discussing the safety zones. He said that although he is not anti-gay, he opposed the scheme because it would be expensive and expose the city to lawsuits if a Safe Zone became dangerous. The proposal will now not be discussed at next week's council meeting. Last year, the city was hit by controversy when the council rescinded a proclamation declaring June as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride month with a resolution calling June a month of community charity and good will to all.\n\nSummary: Cameron Hamilton, mayor of Porterville,.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- \"It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future\" is an aphorism attributed to the great baseball player Yogi Berra. But one topic where pundits, politicians and prognosticators of every persuasion don't have any problem about making pessimistic predictions is terrorism. The Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, was an Olympic-level example of this. In the lead-up to the Games, the airwaves were filled with glum predictions that Sochi would be the 1972 Munich Olympics on steroids. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee, told Fox News, \"There's a high degree of probability that something will detonate, something will go off. ... But I do think it's probably, most likely going to happen outside the 'ring of steel' at the Olympic Village.\" Similarly, Michael G. Grimm, co-chair of the House Russian Caucus, issued a press release headlined, \"Sochi Olympics Cannot Become a Benghazi Nightmare.\" The New York Republican warned, \"We cannot sweep these threats under the rug, like we did with Benghazi or the warnings from Russia on the Tsarnaev brother behind the Boston Marathon bombing. Each time we fail to recognize these threats, we not only risk the lives of innocent Americans, but appear weaker and vulnerable in the eyes of the enemy.\" Bill Rathburn, who directed security for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, in an interview with Yahoo News predicted of Sochi, \"It's not a matter of whether there will be some incident, it's just a matter of how bad it's going to be.\" No wonder that two days before the Sochi Olympics, more than half of Americans believed a terrorist attack on the Games was likely, according to a CNN/ORC poll. Now cue up the swarms of \"black widows\" descending on Sochi to kill themselves along with many Olympic spectators. And then the Games were held and ... nothing happened . It turned out that the most terrifying image from Sochi was the look of disgust on the face of American figure skater Ashley Wagner when she learned of her lower-than-expected score. Sochi is only the most recent example of the hyperventilating hyperbole of the doomsday terrorism prognosticators. Because so many folks were caught flat-footed by 9/11, some seem to overcompensate by keeping up a steady drumbeat of dire terror warnings. In November, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told CNN that al Qaeda \"poses a bigger threat to attack inside the U.S. right now than it did before 9/11.\" Rogers' statement defies common sense. Before 9/11, al Qaeda had an entire county, Afghanistan, as a safe haven; its training camps there churned out thousands of militants every year; it had access to funding substantial enough so that it could spend several hundred thousand dollars on the 9/11 plot. It was a formidable enemy. Now al Qaeda's safe haven is long gone; the group hasn't mounted any successful attack in the States since 9/11 or, for that matter, anywhere in the West since the London transportation system bombings in 2005. On 9/11, the United States had never used armed drones in combat. Since then, the CIA has launched 370 drone strikes at suspected militant targets in Pakistan. During President Barack Obama's tenure alone, those drone strikes have killed more than 30 of al Qaeda's leaders in Pakistan. Not only that: The United States is a much harder target than it was on 9/11. Then there were 16 people on the U.S. \"no fly\" list. Today there are more than 20,000. In 2001, there were 32 Joint Terrorism Task Force \"fusion centers,\" where multiple law enforcement agencies worked together to chase down leads and build terrorism cases. Now there are 103. The U.S. intelligence budget also grew dramatically after 9/11. In 2010, the United States spent more than $80 billion on intelligence collection and other covert activities, much of it directed at terrorist groups -- more than three times what the country spent in 1998. At the time of the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Transportation Security Administration all didn't exist. All these new post-9/11 institutions make it much harder for terrorists to operate in the United States. The gloom and doom about terrorism becomes much worse when the specter of terrorists deploying chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons is added to the mix. Graham Allison, the respected political scientist and founding dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, published a book in 2004 titled \"Nuclear Terrorism, which garnered considerable attention with its prediction that \"on the current path, a nuclear terrorist attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than not.\" Of course, now we are a decade later, and nothing of the sort has happened. Indeed, a striking finding of a database of every jihadist terrorism case in the United States since 9/11 maintained by the New America Foundation is that not one of the more than 200 individuals who were indicted or convicted of a jihadist terrorism crime acquired, manufactured or deployed chemical, biological or radiological weapons, let alone a nuclear device. It's relatively easy to say the sky is always falling. Indeed, given the human capacity for evil, bad things are, indeed, going to happen. But when the sky doesn't fall, which is much of the time when it comes to terrorism, the doomsday prognosticators are rarely held to account. In any event, they are too busy warning of the next catastrophe.\n\nSummary: The Sochi Olympics were marred by a series of terrorist attacks, despite predictions of a secure event, according to security experts. Peter Bergen notes that al Qaeda's threat to the U.S. has increased since 9/11, contrary to government claims.",

An error-strewn performance saw missed tackles galore and three turnovers, one from a muffed punt inside their own 10-yard line. Arguably it turned the game. The Jags were 7-3 up and had reduced Tony Romo, playing with two fractured vertebrae, to a field goal from his opening two drives. Ace Sanders muffs Chris Jones' punt in the first quarter to hand the ball back to Dallas and\u00a0sap momentum . The hardened veteran was not in the mood to return the charity. He looked calm in the red zone, gingerly rolling to his right on third down, finding Jason Witten with a two-yard pass. The score was the first of 28 unanswered points, and the game was over as a contest by half-time. Punt returner Ace Sanders was honest in his appraisal, saying: 'The ball slipped through my fingers. You need to secure the ball first and then worry about what comes next. And I didn't do that. It was very out of character. I need to make some adjustments. 'It definitely happens, but at the same time, you never want it to.' Gus Bradley focuses on the game but Jacksonville suffered their second defeat in two years in London . Coach Gus Bradley appeared frustrated at seeing the same mistakes, week-in, week-out. 'I don't have any real concerns with our effort, with our courage, with our toughness. It's just those self inflicted things, and it's just focus, concentration, whatever the case is. Those things, I think are what causes some frustration,' A particular problem is the inability to tackle, as Bradley continued. 'Well, it wasn't very good right away in the first half. I don't know how many we missed, but it disappeared. We had some sloppiness.' Tony Romo was protected by his offensive line magnificently, with Jags recording just one sack . Dez Bryant burned the Jags' defense on two long touchdown passes, beating man coverage, finding space at will and skipping hapless attempts to stop him. For his second score, a 68-yarder just before the break, he carried safety Johnathan Cyprien for the last 10 yards. 'Yes, I took a bad angle. I took a bad angle, and instead of just trying to get him out of bounds, I reached for him, kind of put the ball this way. It doesn't matter, I missed him, and that can't happen,' \u00a0a dejected Cyprien said. With rookie quarterback Blake Bortles under center, it is bound to be a year of ups and downs. He started the game excellently, finding Allen Robinson and Cecil Shorts III before Denard Robinson went over from 33 yards. Bortles spoke of the undulating nature of his youthful side. 'I mean, the first drive we went down was a really good drive. The offensive line did well. We ran well. Cecil had a play and Denard broke a big run. We came back the second drive and hurt ourselves with the penalty and kind of shot ourselves in the foot for two or three drives after that and never really could get it rolling again.' As they fly home to Florida, the Jags are 1-9 for the third straight season. And with their propensity to shoot themselves in the foot, it is tough to see where their next victory will come from.\n\nSummary: The Jaguars lost 31-16 to the Cowboys in a one-sided affair at Wembley.\nThe Jags did not recover from Ace Sanders' muffed punt in the first quarter.\nMissed tackles, rookie mistakes and three turnovers did not help.\nThe Jags move to 1-9 and travel to the Indianapolis Colts after a bye week.",

Another anonymous ticket holder collected \u00a3113m, while Dave and Angela Dawes, from Cambridgeshire, scooped \u00a3101m in October. The fourth-biggest EuroMillions prize winner in the UK collected \u00a384million in May 2010. They chose to keep their identity secret. In February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, broke the then record with a \u00a356million win \u2013 now the fifth-biggest prize in the history of EuroMillions. The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won \u00a345millon in November 2009. Mansfield . couple Gareth and Catherine Bull, who vowed to buy a box at .

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: In a much-anticipated report, the United Nations has concluded that chemical weapons have been used in the Syrian conflict. Experts investigated seven instances of alleged use and found that chemical weapons were either used, or likely used, in five of those instances. The case that was most clear to inspectors was an August incident near the capital, Damascus. \"The United Nations Mission collected clear and convincing evidence that chemical weapons were used also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August 2013,\" read the 82-page report, which was released on Thursday. Blood and urine samples from patients there tested positive for sarin and sarin signatures, it found. Anti-government activist groups say more than 1,300 people were killed in the attack in Ghouta -- many of them women and children. Graphic video footage showed rows of bodies without apparent injury, as well as people suffering convulsions or apparently struggling to breathe. U.N. inspectors also said they collected credible information, or evidence consistent with the probable use of chemical weapons, in Khan al Asal, Jobar, Saraqueb and Ashrafiah Sahnaya. They were unable to corroborate the allegation that chemical weapons were used in either Bahhariyeh or Sheik Maqsood. The report did not specify whether the government or opposition groups were responsible for the alleged attacks, which happened between March and August this year. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people overall have died since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011. It began with a government crackdown on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement, then slowly spiraled into a bloody, full-blown civil war. Rebel leader denies he fled . Also Thursday, a top Syrian rebel commander denied that he had abandoned his post and said he is working to resolve fighting among opposition groups in the country's north. In the meantime, a decision by the United States and Britain to halt nonlethal aid makes sense, said Salim Idriss, chief of staff of the Free Syrian Army. Several U.S. administration officials had said that the fate of Idriss, a top rebel commander supported by the West, was uncertain as conflicts persisted between the Free Syrian Army and Islamist groups. Idriss denied reports that he fled to a Gulf state after the Islamic Front allegedly seized a warehouse held by the Free Syrian Army. He did leave Syria, but is working at his office on the Turkish border and has not left his job, Idriss told CNN. In this case, he was already in Turkey when the attack on the warehouse happened, he said. On Wednesday, Turkey sealed its border with Syria because of the fighting between opposition groups in Syria. In the past two days, Idriss has been talking with different groups and has tried to resolve their differences, he said. \"The situation in the north of Syria now is very complicated and very dangerous because there are some problems between some groups, and I think we will try and we should try everything now to find a solution for this problem,\" he said. The Islamic Front, which announced its formation last month, is an alliance that includes tens of thousands of fighters from some of Syria's most powerful Islamist groups, including Ahrar al-Sham, Suqour al-Sham, the Islamic Army and the Tawhid Brigade. The groups control territory in key areas across Syria and have been fighting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad along the critical lines of Damascus and Aleppo, among other places. The front's formation has diminished the stature of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and its leadership abroad, the Syrian National Coalition, as leaders inside the country have sought to distance themselves from a command structure criticized for failing to serve the opposition's needs on the ground. 'Infighting is growing' The seizure of the warehouse this week could prove key in shaping how the United States deals with the Syrian opposition. \"The Syrian opposition has never been a unified fighting force but infighting is growing and, naturally, this is hindering cooperation on the battlefield,\" said one U.S. official. \"At least temporarily, there will be more turbulence within the opposition as the new groups that have cropped up compete for power.  What isn't clear yet is whether the various factions will refocus attention on toppling Assad or become embroiled in internecine fighting that would play to the regime's advantage.\" According to Idriss, the Islamic fighters did not take over the warehouse, but attacked a Free Syrian Army battalion that was protecting it and took its inventory. It was unclear which group gave the orders to attack the battalion, he said. The inventory that was inside the warehouse -- which was not American aid, Idriss said -- is in good shape and will hopefully be returned. Idriss admitted that he doesn't fully trust the Islamists, but that an agreement must be reached to control the fighting and form a single command. The fighting among these groups opposed to al-Assad led the United States and Britain to suspend nonlethal aid to the rebel groups. \"It is very difficult now to pass the support to the right hands. And that's why I can understand the, let me say, freezing the support for a period of time,\" Idriss said. The Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army called the allegations that Idriss had abandoned his post rumors. \"Such rumors only serve to impact on the morale of our brothers fighting on the ground at a time when we need to concentrate on stopping the criminal regime, which continues to perpetrate horrific massacres all over the country against our people,\" the council said in a statement.\n\nSummary: The United Nations report confirms the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons in Damascus, with conclusive evidence of sarin gas attacks on civilians.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: London (CNN) -- UK newspaper and magazine publishers lost a High Court bid Wednesday to block the progress of a government-backed royal charter on press regulation. The royal charter, which has cross-party backing, was due to go before the Privy Council on Wednesday for approval after the High Court ruling. The industry groups that brought the unsuccessful legal challenge said they were \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision and would try to overturn it on appeal. \"This is a vital constitutional issue and we will be taking our case for judicial review -- of the Privy Council's decisions on both the industry Charter and the cross-party Charter -- to the Court of Appeal,\" they said. The legal challenge was brought to the High Court by the Press Standards Board of Finance (Pressbof), which is the industry body that funds the current press watchdog, the Press Complaints Commission. It sought permission to seek a judicial review of the politician-backed royal charter on the grounds that the industry's own proposed royal charter was not properly considered and that the process was \"startlingly unfair.\" The industry's draft royal charter was rejected by the Privy Council, a body made up of government ministers, earlier this year. But the High Court ruled against the legal challenge. The cross-party royal charter follows months of talks between the industry and lawmakers on how to establish a system of independent press self-regulation, following an inquiry last year into press ethics led by Lord Justice Leveson. The inquiry was set up after outrage over claims of widespread phone hacking and other abuses by elements of the UK press. A number of criminal prosecutions are being brought in relation to those claims. Critics say the government-backed royal charter risks weakening the freedom of the press by allowing political interference, while supporters argue that the newspaper industry has failed to regulate itself effectively so far. 'Proper complaints system' The Department for Culture, Media and Sport earlier welcomed the High Court ruling. \"Both the industry and the government agree self-regulation of the press is the way forward and we both agree that a Royal Charter is the best framework for that,\" it said in a statement. \"We are clear the process for considering the industry royal charter was robust and fair and the courts have agreed. We can now get on with implementing the cross-party charter. \"A royal charter will protect freedom of the press whilst offering real redress when mistakes are made. Importantly, it is the best way of resisting full statutory regulation that others have tried to impose.\" Labour Party deputy leader Harriet Harman also voiced her support for the ruling. \"Now is the time for a proper complaints system which is effective and independent of press and politicians which does not infringe the freedom of the press,\" she said. \"We need a press which is robust and free, which holds those in power to account, but which does not abuse its own power by wreaking havoc on the lives of innocent people.\" 'Good for journalism' Campaign group Hacked Off, which has called for tougher regulation of the press, has backed the royal charter opposed by the newspaper industry. \"The big newspaper companies like the Mail and the Murdoch press have been in denial ever since the Leveson inquiry report condemned the way they treated ordinary people and said they needed to change,\" executive director Brian Cathcart said in a statement. \"The inquiry judge has told them this. Their own readers -- the public -- have told them. Their past victims have told them. Every single party in Parliament has told them. Now the courts have thrown out their latest manoeuvre.\" Cathcart said the royal charter was \"good for journalism, good for freedom of speech, and -- vitally -- good for the public.\" Government interference? The Pressbof challenge was made \"in the context of a wholly unfair and irrational process leading to a recommendation and decision that has the potential profoundly to affect the nature of press regulation in this country,\" according to a statement filed with the court. The newspaper publishers argued that they were not properly consulted about the rival royal charter, which has cross-party political support. They also argued that the government-backed royal charter does not guarantee freedom of the press from political interference, since it can be amended with the agreement of a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Both versions of the royal charter envisage the establishment of a \"recognition panel\" to oversee a self-regulatory committee that would consider complaints against the press and would have the power to impose fines of up to 1 million pounds ($1.6 million) against newspapers for wrongdoing. Their differences hinge on how that panel is made up and on how changes can be made to the charter. The rejected Pressbof charter proposed that it be amended after agreement by the industry itself, while the government-backed version would be subject to a vote in Parliament. Protecting a free press . The Privy Council rejected the industry's draft charter on the grounds that under its terms, the recognition panel would not be sufficiently independent and that it would not have sufficient powers to ensure proper redress. But Pressbof argues that its version of the royal charter is more likely to meet Leveson's aim of \"a genuinely independent and effective system of self-regulation,\" free from government interference. Culture Secretary Maria Miller told lawmakers this month that the government \"must protect our free press whilst striking the right balance between independence and redress for individuals.\" The independent Leveson inquiry was set up by Prime Minister David Cameron to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public, police and politicians.\n\nSummary: NEW: UK newspapers to appeal after losing legal challenge to a government-backed plan. Campaign group Hacked Off welcomes ruling on cross-party royal charter. \"Charter will protect freedom of the press\" and offer real redress, government says. Newspaper chiefs fear the proposed royal charter may allow interference by politicians.",

The Chelsea manager failed to win any trophies in his first season back at the club last year, while Arsene Wenger ended nine years without silverware at Arsenal by winning the FA Cup. When asked if he felt under pressure to deliver, Mourinho replied: \u2018Why? Some managers have 10 years to win something.\u2019 City\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini won the Premier League and League Cup double last year with a squad inherited from Roberto Mancini. Under the Italian they won the title, the FA Cup and the Community Shield.

I don\u2019t like easy jobs.\u2019 On the attack: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho took a thinly veiled swipe at two of his biggest title rivals . Content: Mourinho doesn't feel under pressure despite failing to win a trophy last season . Upbeat: After talking down their chances last season, Mourinho admits Chelsea are now title contenders . Last season, Mourinho branded Wenger a \u2018specialist in failure\u2019 and rowed with Pellegrini about which clubs had spent the most money. The Portuguese considers that he has been in the process of building his own squad at Stamford Bridge, not using the one handed down by Rafael Benitez. This summer Chelsea have brought in Diego Costa for \u00a332million and spent \u00a316m on Filipe Luis, both from Atletico Madrid, signed Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona for \u00a330m and added Didier Drogba on a free transfer.

And most importantly my boss, my owner, my board will judge.\u2019 After talking down their chances last season, Mourinho, who starts his campaign against newly- promoted Burnley on Monday, admits Chelsea are title contenders. But he claims some managers are given an easier ride than others when it comes to rating success. \u2018You don\u2019t look with the same eyes on different people, don\u2019t measure people by the same dimensions,\u2019 he explained. \u2018For some to reach success is to achieve this and for others to achieve success is to achieve that. Because of my last 10 years and Chelsea\u2019s last 10 years I understand why you always put the level high for myself and Chelsea. \u2018I really don\u2019t care about it. I just care about being myself, to work hard every day, to have ambition to win the next game, it doesn\u2019t matter which competition or which opponent.

Wait: Mourinho's Chelsea will begin their Premier League campaign at Burnley on Monday night . Splash the cash: The Chelsea boss has brought in the likes of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Felipe Luis . Perhaps the toughest decision Mourinho faced ahead of this new campaign was who to pick as his No 1 goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois, who has spent three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid, or Petr Cech, who has made the position his own since he joined the club in June 2004, a day before Mourinho was announced as manager for his first spell. Mourinho considers both to be in the top three goalkeepers in the world. He appears to believe the 22-year-old Belgian is finally ready to take over the mantle from Cech, a decade his senior. But Mourinho will not disrespect Cech by playing him with second-string sides in games of less importance and suggests there is a still a role for him to play at the club. \u2018I must support the keeper who is not first choice,\u2019 he said. \u2018Supporting him is not to give him a Capital One Cup game. It is to show him my trust when no one is expecting that he plays. I did that with Cech and Carlo Cudicini. I played Cudicini against Real Betis in the Champions League in the first game of the group, not in the sixth when we had already qualified. \u2018I also played him in one league match when we were not champions, not after being champions. The best way to show a player you trust him is to play him when no one expects it and in games where there are responsibilities. With these two I can do that.\u2019 Swipe: Mourinho claims Manuel Pellegrini inherited success at Manchester City .\n\nSummary: Mourinho celebrates his first season back at Chelsea with a Premier League title, while Wenger continues a decade without trophies at Arsenal.

UPDATED: . 12:33 EST, 27 December 2012 . While the U.S. stares over the 'fiscal cliff' and $536 billion in tax increases for all Americans, President Obama and the House of Representatives have been accused of acting like kindergarten students engaged in a dangerous dare of 'who goes first'. President Obama returned to Washington D.C. after cutting short his Christmas vacation and the Senate is going back into session, but the Republican ruled House is still out on recess as the deadline of January 1st looms that could damage a still fragile recovery. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner informed Congress on Wednesday that the government was on track to hit its borrowing limit on Monday and that he would take 'extraordinary measures as authorized by law' to postpone a government default. Scroll down for video . U.S. President Barack Obama walks across the South Lawn upon his return to the White House today in Washington D.C. President Obama returned to Washington under pressure to forge a year-end deal with Republicans to avoid the tax hikes and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff . Still, he added, uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations over taxes and spending made it difficult to determine how much time those measures would buy. In recent days, Obama's aides have been consulting with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's office, but Republicans have not been part of the discussions, suggesting much still needs to be done if a deal, even a small one, were to be struck and passed through Congress by Monday. At stake are current tax rates that expire on Dec. 31 and revert to the higher rates in place during the administration of President Bill Clinton. All in all, that means $536 billion in tax increases that would touching nearly all Americans. Moreover, the military and other federal departments would have to cut $110 billion in spending. This chart shows a snapshot of how single people in different income groups will be affected by the U.S. stepping off the fiscal cliff . The fiscal cliff tax burden for married people is shown here in this graph . President Barack Obama waves as he boards Air Force One to return to Washington to deal with the looming fiscal cliff that the U.S. is staring over . But while economists have warned about the economic impact of tax hikes and spending cuts of that magnitude, both sides appear to be proceeding as if they have more than just four days left. Indeed, Congress could still act in January in time to retroactively counter the effect on most taxpayers and government agencies, but chances for a large deficit reduction package would likely be put off. House Republican leaders on Wednesday said they remain ready to negotiate, but urged the Senate to consider or amend a House-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. In a statement, the leaders said the House would consider whatever the Senate passed. 'But the Senate first must act,' they said. Aides said any decision to bring House members back to Washington would be driven by what the Senate does. Reid's office responded shortly after, insisting that the House act on Senate legislation passed in July that would raise tax rates only on incomes above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples. Meanwhile, Obama has been pushing for a variant of that Senate bill that would include an extension of jobless aid and some surgical spending reductions to prevent the steeper and broader spending cuts from kicking in. President Barack Obama greets base visitors and personnel before boarding Air Force One to return to Washington on December 26th from Hawaii . For the Senate to act, it would require a commitment from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell not to demand a 60-vote margin to consider the legislation on the Senate floor. McConnell's office says it's too early to make such an assessment because Obama's plan is unclear on whether extended benefits for the unemployed would be paid for with cuts in other programs or on how it would deal with an expiring estate tax, among other issues. What's more, House Speaker John Boehner would have to let the bill get to the House floor for a vote. Given the calendar, chances of accomplishing that by Dec. 31 were becoming a long shot. Amid the standoff, Geithner advised Congress on Wednesday that the administration will begin taking action to prevent the government from hitting its borrowing limit. In a letter to congressional leaders, Geithner said accounting measures could save approximately $200 billion. That could keep the government from reaching the debt limit for about two months. But if Congress and the White House don't agree on how to avoid the \"fiscal cliff,\" he said, the amount of time before the government hits its borrowing limit is more uncertain. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is going to unveil 'extraordinary measures' in efforts to avoid the nation triggering the debt ceiling . 'If left unresolved, the expiring tax provisions and automatic spending cuts, as well as the attendant delays in filing of tax returns, would have the effect of adding some additional time to the duration of the extraordinary measures,' he wrote. Whenever the debt ceiling hits, however, it is likely to set up yet another deadline for one more budget fight between the White House and congressional Republicans. Initially, clearing the way for a higher debt ceiling was supposed to be part of a large deal aimed at reducing deficits by more than $2 trillion over 10 years with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts, including reductions in health programs like Medicare. But chances for that bargain fizzled last week when conservatives sank Boehner's legislation to only let tax increases affect taxpayers with earnings of $1 million or more. Obama and his aides have said they would refuse to let Republicans leverage spending cuts in return for raising the debt ceiling. But Republicans say the threat of voting against an increase in the limit is one of the best ways to win deficit reduction measures. Another potential showdown is pending. A renewed clash over spending could come in late March; spending authority for much of the government expires on March 27. The U.S. Treasury Department will begin taking steps this week to delay hitting the government's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit, or else the debt limit would be hit on Dec. 31, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said WednesdayThe U.S. Treasury Department will begin taking steps this week to delay hitting the government's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit, or else the debt limit would be hit on Dec. 31. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a letter Wednesday to congressional leaders that the department will take several accounting measures to save approximately $200 billion. The government borrows about $100 billion a month, so that typically would keep the government from reaching the limit for about two months. The move comes as President Barack . Obama and the GOP congressional leadership are locked in negotiations . over how to avoid a series of tax increases and spending cuts, known as . the 'fiscal cliff,' that are scheduled to take effect next week. Congressional . officials said Wednesday they knew of no significant strides toward a . compromise over a long Christmas weekend, and no negotiations have been . set. After conferring . on a conference call, the House Republican leadership said they remain . ready for talks, but gave no hint they intend to call lawmakers back . into session unless the Senate first passes legislation. 'The . lines of communication remain open, and we will continue to work with . our colleagues to avert the largest tax hike in American history, and to . address the underlying problem, which is spending,' the leadership said . in a statement. Obama . has sought to include an increase in the borrowing limit in the talks. But Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders have demanded . concessions in return. The negotiations hit a stalemate last week and . Obama and lawmakers are returning to Washington this week to resume . talks. Geithner says it is harder to predict how long the delay will last because ongoing negotiations over tax and budget policies make it hard to forecast what tax revenue and government spending will be next year. The borrowing limit is the amount of . debt the government can pile up. The government accumulates debt two . ways: It borrows money from investors by issuing Treasury bonds, and it . borrows from itself, mostly from Social Security revenue. The move comes as President Obama and the GOP are locked in negotiations over how to avoid the fiscal cliff. Obama is pictured (second right) with Geithner (far left), House Speaker John Boehner (second left) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (right) In 2011, Congress raised the limit to nearly $16.4 trillion from $14.3 trillion. Three decades ago, the national debt was $908 billion. But Washington spent more than it took in, and the debt rose steadily \u2014 surpassing $1 trillion in 1982, then $5 trillion in 1996. It reached $10 trillion in 2008 as the financial crisis and recession dried up tax revenue and as the government spent more on unemployment benefits and other programs. In August 2011, the rating agency Standard & Poor's stunned the world by stripping the U.S. government of its prized AAA bond rating because it feared that America's dysfunctional political system couldn't deliver credible plans to reduce the federal government's debt. S&P decried American 'political brinksmanship' and concluded that 'the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge.' A year and a half later, the two political parties are still as deadlocked as ever. Despite S&P's warnings and the political stalemate, investors still want U.S. Treasurys. Given economic turmoil in Europe and uncertainty elsewhere, U.S. government debt and U.S. dollars look like the safest bet around. That is why the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year Treasury notes has fallen from 2.58 Aug. 5, 2011 to 1.75 percent Wednesday.\n\nSummary: President Obama has extended his Christmas vacation in Hawaii as negotiations over the fiscal cliff continue, with the House of Representatives taking the lead on crafting a compromise before the debt ceiling is reached on Monday. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has reassured Congress that no immediate action is necessary, as tax increases are not imminent.",

Family, friends and fellow comedians gathered at the Paramount Theatre in Peekskill, New York, yesterday to pay tribute to the man known affectionately as Uncle Jimmy Mack. During the service McNair's son sang a poignant tribute to his father, while his daughter Danita had to be supported by her brother as she passed out going by his open casket. Scroll down for video . A funeral service for comedian James McNair, who was killed in the car crash that injured fellow comic Tracy Morgan, has been held at the Paramount Theatre in Peekskill, New York . Friends, family and fellow comedians gathered to pay tribute to the man known as Uncle Jimmy Mack . McNair's body was placed in front of the stage. At one point during an open casket viewing his daughter, Danita, had to be carried away, supported by his brother . Remembering McNair's life, fellow performers told about his habit of paying comics out of his own pocket if an audience failed to materialise at one of his shows, and recalled how he sold bootleg DVDs to boost his income. 'If another person come here and try to sell bootleg DVDs, you need to get rid of them immediately,' joked one attendee according to CBS. The New York Daily News reports that McNair had been saving before his death in an attempt to buy a prom dress for Danita. During the service mourners had an impromptu collection and raised $500 for her. McNair (left) was killed in the same crash that left fellow comic Tracy Morgan (right) in critical condition after their limo was rear-ended by a Walmart lorry . Outside the theatre, mourners queued down the pavement to pay their respects among a media scrum as the casket arrived in a hearse . Peekskill mayor Frank Catalina praised McNair's community spirit, thanking him for his work with young people . Peekskill mayor Frank Catalina paid tribute to McNair's community work, saying: 'He was very serious about talking about the youth of our community. He didn\u2019t fool around when you talked about health care.' McNair was killed in a crash early Saturday when a Walmart truck smashed into the limo bus he was travelling in on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7. The collision injured McNair's fellow passenger, comedian Tracy Morgan, while comedians Ardie Fuqua, 43, and Harris Stanton and Morgan's assistant Jeffrey Millea, 36, were also among those injured. Stanton, 37, was released from hospital on Monday with a severely broken wrist. The service featured a performance from a gospel choir (pictured), as well as a song performed by McNair's son . After the service, McNair's family gathered around his casket to say a final goodbye to the comedian .

Sources close to Morgan say the 30 Rock star is still in critical condition following the accident, but is 'doing better after sustaining a number of injuries - including a broken femur, broken nose and broken ribs. McNair's friend and fellow comedian Tracy Morgan is still in critical condition following the crash (left), while Kevin Roper (right), the truck driver involved in the collision, has been charged with assault by auto . Kevin Roper, 35, the truck driver involved in the crash, has been charged with one count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in connection with the crash, but pleaded not guilty during an appearance at Middlesex County Superior Court in New Jersey on Wednesday. A conviction on a death by auto charge carries a five-to-10-year prison sentence. Each assault by auto charge is punishable by up to 18 months in prison. Following the hearing, Mr. Roper, 35, was released on $50,000 bail.\n\nSummary: A memorial service for James McNair, affectionately known as Uncle Jimmy Mack, took place in New Jersey.

Navy Petty Officer Stephen Jones, a student at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Charleston, South Carolina, told CNN that on the night of February 5, a male sailor stopped by to watch the CW TV show \"Vampire Diaries.\" \"He has come over to watch shows in the past,\" Jones said. The two watched the show on his bed but accidentally fell asleep. Jones says his roommate walked in around midnight. \"My roommate walked in and it woke me up,\" Jones said. He then woke up his friend, Navy Petty Officer Bryan McGee, who according to Jones, immediately left the room. But the Navy is proceeding with discharging Jones, charging him with \"willful failure to exhibit professional conduct,\" Jones' lawyer, Greg Myers said. \"It is a violation of the Command Instruction for sailors to act unprofessionally in the barracks. It is considered unprofessional conduct to share the same bed in Navy barracks,\" said Thomas Dougan, a spokesman for the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. Jones, who claims nothing sexual happened, said they were both clothed, him in pajama pants and a white t-shirt and McGee in boxers, and that two were not under the covers together. Jones was lying above the covers while McGee lay below. The play-by-play given by Jones is substantiated by the Naval investigating documents, although a different account on the amount of clothing worn was given by Jones' roommate who claimed in his naval statement that both sailors were only dressed in their boxers. Jones' roommate, who was uncomfortable by what he saw, according to Myers, Jones' attorney, moved out of the room a day later and reported the incident to command officials. An investigation was launched, ending with the Command attempting to punish Jones and McGee by a \"Captain's Mast,\" a non-judicial procedure meant to avoid a court martial. McGee, who declined to comment on the case, accepted the mast and punishment but Jones refused, moving the Navy to begin proceedings to discharge him. Punishment by Captain's Mast could have resulted in loss of rank, forfeiture of pay, or jeopardized Jones' top secret security clearance, Myers said. \"I'm not pleading guilty to something that I didn't do. I did not commit a crime,\" said Jones. \"I am the type of person that takes responsibility for my actions. If I break a rule, I take my punishment. And I know I did not break any rules.\" Myers also said he is adamant that no crime was committed. \"In the end, Jones was charged with falling asleep while watching a show on his computer while on his bed over the covers where another man under the covers was also sleeping. This is not a crime and never will be as there was and is no duty to avoid such a circumstance as a matter of laws,\" said Myers in a statement sent to the Navy. Jones and his lawyer charge that the Naval Command suspects Jones of being gay and wants to discharge him for that reason alone. \"This Command suspects that Jones is a homosexual but has no proof. It cannot invoke 'don't ask, don't tell' because there is no homosexual conduct and there is no admission of homosexuality. Yet this homophobic Command is using its suspicions to reach the same result as though there were,\" said Myers. \"This is bigotry disguised as the rule of law.\" Jones would not comment on his sexual orientation saying, \"that is my business and my business alone\". President Obama signed the so-called \"don't ask, don't tell\" repeal into law in December but it's not officially off the books until Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President give the OK that the military is ready to implement the repeal. For now, the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy remains in place, although no military personnel have been discharged under that policy since October, when Gates changed procedures to have such separations reviewed at the highest levels, a point, Myers says, was not forgotten by the Naval Command. \"The Secretary of Defense has said that 'don't ask, don't tell' cases will be reviewed at the highest levels. This case is disguised as misconduct to avoid that result,\" said Myers. \"This is a subterfuge being used by this Commander because he does not have the elements of proof to separate him for homosexuality, but he suspects homosexuality, so he has created this illusion that Stephen has engaged in misconduct of some form.\" The Navy denies the separation proceedings are based on the suspicion of homosexual behavior. \"Naval Nuclear Power Training Command is not administratively processing either of these sailors for separation based on sexual orientation,\" said Dougan. But one gay rights group worries this case may be an example of some in the military trying to get around the \"don't ask don't tell\" repeal by charging suspected homosexuals with other offenses. \"We've seen this before,\" said Alex Nicholson, executive director of Servicemembers United, the nation's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans. \"Here is the classic text book case of trumping up charges and exaggerating an event to try to punish someone. And this is exactly what the senior defense leadership has said would not and should not happen when DADT goes away.\" For now, the 21-year-old Jones says that even though he is disappointed in the Naval Command, he just wants to keep his job and finish his training to become a nuclear operator on an aircraft carrier or a submarine. \"I enjoyed my job. I enjoyed the environment and I was interested in what I was learning. It has been challenging but it was definitely something that I wanted to complete,\" said Jones.\n\nSummary: Petty Officer Stephen Jones says he fell asleep with another sailor while watching television.\nHis roommate caught the two sailors sleeping and reported them to supervisors.\nThe NAVY has said the sleepover is a violation and unprofessional.",

But in recent years supermarket aisles have become awash with these Italian Christmas cakes. However, how do you pick the best? Italian chef Aldo Zilli put a selection of supermarket panettones to the test. Would any match up to his mamma's recipe? Scroll down for video .

Gran Ducale Panettone Classico . 500g, \u00a33 (currently \u00a32), Asda . Bellissimo! This looks truly authentic. No wonder \u2014 it's made just outside Venice. And it tastes as good as it looks. It's been filled properly, with a good proportion of fruit and peel (14 per cent sultanas and 7 per cent orange peel). The peel is deliciously chunky \u2014 as it should be. And the dough is sweet and buttery. With panettone this cheap and delicious, even I'd be mad to make my own. 5/5 . Expensive: Sainsbury's Classic Taste The Difference Panettone, \u00a310 . Classic Taste The Difference Panettone . 750g, \u00a310, Sainsbury's . As I unwrap it, I'm enveloped in the smell of an Italian Christmas: buttery dough and juicy sultanas. Growing up in Italy, my breakfast treat on Christmas day was home-made panettone and a huge latte. The crown is bouncy to the touch \u2014 so freshly baked \u2014 but the taste is disappointing. The peel content is just 3 per cent. For \u00a310, I expect something more luxurious. 3/5 . Yuck! Tesco Maina Classic Panettone . Maina Classic Panettone . 500g, \u00a34, Tesco . Though there's a reasonable amount of fruit (16.5 per cent sultanas and 4 per cent peel) it's shrivelled, not juicy. Its dough should be extremely soft, sweet and buttery; this is as dry and crumbly as the bedding in my kids' hamster cage, with a synthetic aftertaste. Yuck! 1/5 . Another winner: Waitrose Christmas Classic Panettone . Christmas Classic Panettone . 750g, \u00a39(\u00a37 while stocks last), Waitrose . The label says it's rich in butter and flecked with raisins and candied orange peel. With a whopping 24 per cent raisins, I agree (I normally use 20 per cent). This would be good enough as the centrepiece of my Christmas Eve feast. 5/5 . Taste the Difference Orange and Cranberry Panettone . 750g, \u00a310, Sainsbury's . Oh dear \u2014 this is horrid. When baked properly, a panettone is golden-brown on top and buttercup yellow inside. This is pale and insipid-looking and it sticks to the paper, so I suspect it hasn't been baked properly. The orange is overpowering. No wonder \u2014 it's packed with 12 per cent orange peel. 2/5 . Not traditional enough: Lidl Favorina Panettone Cioccolato . Favorina Panettone Cioccolato . 800g, \u00a33.99, Lidl . Rather than sultanas and orange peel this has chocolate instead. The chocolate is surprisingly good quality for the price \u2014 not too sweet. But the dough is crumbly and dry. My kids would love it. But I'd rather they had a proper panettone with my own chocolate sauce than this. 3/5 . Specially Selected Traditional Italian Panettone . 500g, \u00a32.99, Aldi . There's not enough sugar and the fruit (14 per cent sultanas and 9 per cent orange and lemon peel) is on the dry side. The only way to save this is to butter a slice, sprinkle a little bit of sugar on top and then grill until lightly toasted. I'd rather pay a little extra for a truly delicious panettone. 1/5 . Italian Panettone Classico . 1kg, \u00a315, Marks & Spencer . Wow! I love the white sugar sprinkles over the top. It looks like a giant Amaretti biscuit. As soon as I cut into this, I'm engulfed by Christmassy smells. My treat every November was to help my mum make panettones \u2014 six at a time. I'd mix the dough while Mum soaked the fruit in dessert wine. Once baked, she would wrap them in tea towels and hang them upside down on her washing line for four hours. That's the secret to keeping the dough airy. M&S's is a little light on fruit (12 per cent sultanas) but the dough is as moist as Mum's. Magnificent! 4/5 . Interview: Tessa Cunningham .

But we found a very different reality. We had traveled from the city of Herat in out to Afghanistan's western border to film a story on the smuggling of weaponry to the Taliban from Iran - we wanted to get a sense of how much was being done to block the smuggling trails along the Iranian border -- an area of remote mountain trails and passes. The local security commissioner had insisted we take a police escort. Once we had finished filming at the official crossing I asked the commander of the detail if he knew where the main smuggling trail across the border was as I'd heard it was just outside of Eslam Ghalagh. He agreed to take us and we climbed back into our cars. Less then five minutes later we turned off the main road onto a dusty track. Another five minutes and the police car leading the way came to a halt - we were less than 10 kilometers from the official crossing and we'd arrived. It was the best known smuggling trail, but just one of many hundreds of trails that snake through the mountains here. Afghanistan's border with Iran is around 1,000 kilometers long. There is no doubt that it's one of the most difficult in the world to police. But all the Afghans we spoke to were adamant that while the Iranians are deadly serious about blocking the drug trade into Iran from Afghanistan, they are much less rigorous about the traffic in weapons in the other direction. And the sources we spoke with - Afghan, Taliban and Western - believe that is a matter of policy. But it's far from clear at what level in the Iranian government -- if any -- the arms shipments are organized or approved. For their part, the Iranians strenuously deny involvement in the smuggling. The Embassy in London told me: \"These allegations are fabricated to pervert attentions from the problems and damage created by foreign forces in [Afghanistan.\"] . Getting people to talk about the smuggling on camera was almost impossible. It's no overstatement to say that many Afghans in Herat are scared of their powerful neighbor to the West. Nearly everyone who gave us information did so on condition of anonymity. Several of the officials we interviewed happily gave us access to their records and reports but as soon as the camera was switched on the stock response was that they were not authorized to comment. On our last day in Herat we finally were given access to the evidence store where the weaponry seized along the border was kept. The source helping us had to resort to locking us in his office after smuggling an Iranian mine out of the store room so we could film it. It was same kind as those used by the Taliban in roadside bomb attacks. Later that day, a very senior contact in the Afghan security services gave us access to the Afghan police's evidence file. Although the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan has made numerous statements about Iranian weaponry and training being provided to the Taliban the Afghan government has remained largely silent. In Herat the provincial authorities have spent the last two years filming every weapon haul they've intercepted coming over the Iranian border, photographing serial numbers written in Persian and establishing which models are produced in Iranian state armament factories. If the Afghan government decides to take up the issue with Tehran, they'll find all the evidence they need here in Herat.\n\nSummary: Large network of trails used to smuggle weapons found at Iran-Afghan border. Millions spent by international community on securing border. Border is roughly 1,000 km long, making it difficult to police.",

A gas-compressor and gas-holder station in Mryn, Ukraine. Gazprom said it had cut supplies to Ukraine Thursday. Gazprom had been threatening the move, saying months of negotiations with Ukraine had failed to resolve the issue of outstanding payments. The company says Ukraine owes about $2 billion for past natural gas deliveries. Ukraine also disputes the new price set by Gazprom for 2009 deliveries, which was initially more than double the price from 2008. Gazprom has reassured the rest of Europe that its natural gas supply, which runs through Ukraine, will not be affected by the dispute with Kiev. Thursday, a Gazprom spokesman said on Russian state television the company had actually increased the deliveries to the rest of the continent. \"Gazprom will continue supplying gas for its consumers in Europe at full volume,\" the company's chief executive, Alexey Miller, said. \"We have an effective transit contract.\" Without natural gas, some Ukrainians could be in for chilly days and nights. The temperature at midday Thursday in Kiev was 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius), with a forecast high of only 32 F (0 C) and snow predicted overnight.  Watch a report on Gazprom's threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine \u00bb . Ukraine's state-controlled energy company, Naftogaz Ukrainy, said Thursday it is ensuring domestic natural gas needs are covered by taking gas from underground storage facilities. \"All of Ukraine's consumers are fully secured,\" the company said in a statement. In Washington, the White House urged a resolution Thursday. \"The United States would like to see a restoration of normal deliveries,\" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. \"The parties should be resolving their differences through good-faith negotiations, without supply cutoffs.\" The frigid weather is of particular concern, the White House said. \"We urge both sides to keep in mind the humanitarian implications of any interruption of gas supply in the winter,\" Johndroe said. Naftogaz Ukrainy also disputed Gazprom's claim that it owes for past deliveries, saying Thursday it has paid its debt to Gazprom in full, though it declined to give a figure. Another part of the dispute centers on Gazprom's price hike for 2009 gas deliveries. Gazprom had wanted to more than double Ukraine's payments, but Wednesday it offered a lower price. Ukraine, which currently pays about $100 per 1,000 cubic meters, balked at the figure offered, saying it simply can't afford to pay the new price. It is the second time in three years Gazprom has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. The company made good on its threat on January 1, 2006, but turned the supply back on a day later. Russia is the world's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via the pipelines through Ukraine. Naftogaz said in its statement Thursday that it would ensure the uninterrupted flow of Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine, but only under existing arrangements. It indicated some gas deliveries to Europe could be halted in Ukraine if Naftogaz fails to reach a new agreement with Gazprom. Although gas is still flowing to Europe, there are also concerns in Russia that the amount could be reduced if Ukraine siphons off some of the gas headed to the west. Naftogaz said it will continue negotiating with Gazprom to address the issues.\n\nSummary: Russia's energy monopoly Gazprom cuts off gas supplies to Ukraine.

His rise from DIY store worker to international playboy with a \u00a3250million fortune is the stuff of dreams. A few years after quitting his \u00a35,000-a-year job as a cashier for Wickes, James Ibori had become one of Nigeria's most influential and richest politicians. He wasted no time spending his new-found wealth on luxury homes, top-of-the-range cars, five-star travel and fees at exclusive boarding schools. Playboy lifestyle: Former Wickes cashier James Ibori, 49, has admitted a fraud totalling more than \u00a350million which he committed while a former Nigerian state governor . But yesterday the 49-year-old stood . shame-faced in the dock of London's Southwark Court as he admitted . stealing tens of millions of pounds from the oil-rich state he governed . in Nigeria. Scotland Yard detectives believe his fraud could exceed . \u00a3250million. He was on trial in the UK because much of the stolen money was laundered through his London office. Ibori moved from Nigeria to West . London in the late 1980s and was found guilty of stealing goods from the . Wickes store he worked at in Ruislip in 1990. A year later he was . convicted of handling a stolen credit card. He moved back to Nigeria and worked for its president, Sani Abacha, as a policy consultant. Rising quickly through the ranks of . the ruling People's Democratic Party, he was voted governor of Delta . State in 1999, winning re-election four years later. In power, he systematically stole from . the public purse, taking kickbacks and transferring state funds to his . own bank accounts around the world. Luxury: Exclusive home that Ibori bought in Hampstead, north London,  with \u00a32.2million in cash in 2001 . He was helped by family members, . including his wife Theresa, sister Christine Ibori-Ibie, his mistress . Udoamaka Oniugbo, and Mayfair lawyer Bhadresh Gohil. A massive police investigation into . Ibori's activities revealed he had bought six properties in London, . including a six-bedroom house with indoor pool in Hampstead for . \u00a32.2million and a flat opposite the nearby Abbey Road recording studios. There was also a property in Dorset, a \u00a33.2million mansion in South Africa and further real estate in Nigeria. Extravagant: Ibori, 49, owned an apartment in this block on Abbey Road, London, opposite the famous music studios . Fleet of cars: The former Nigerian state governor owned a number of cars including this Bentley Continental worth in the region of \u00a3150,000 . He owned a fleet of armoured Range . Rovers costing \u00a3600,000 and a \u00a3120,000 Bentley. On one of his trips to . London he bought a Mercedes Maybach for more than \u00a3300,000 at a dealer . on Park Lane and immediately shipped it to South Africa. He bought a private jet for . \u00a312million, spent \u00a3126,000 a month on his credit cards and ran up a . \u00a315,000 bill for a two-day stay at the Lanesborough hotel in London. Prosecutor Sasha Wass told the court . Ibori concealed his UK criminal record, which would have excluded him . from office in Nigeria. Extraordinary extravagance: Ibori owned a fleet of armoured Range Rovers - including this one - bought with the proceeds of his \u00a350million fraud . Large home: James Ibori's home in Abuja, Nigeria. Today he was facing a jail sentence after admitting a \u00a350million fraud . 'He was never the legitimate governor . and there was effectively a thief in government house,' Miss Wass said. 'As the pretender of that public office, he was able to plunder Delta . State's wealth and hand out patronage.' The court heard Ibori abused his position to award contracts to his associates including his sister and his mistress. Scotland Yard began its investigation . into Ibori after officers found two computer hard drives in his London . office that revealed his criminality. Fraudsters: Solicitor Bhadresh Gohil (left) and Ibori's wife Theresa (right) who have already been convicted of money laundering in the scam . Convicted: Ibori's sister Christine Ibori-Idie (left) and his mistress Udoamaka Oniugbo (right) have also been found guilty of money laundering . He was arrested by the Nigerian . Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in December 2007, but two years . later a court in his home town, Asaba, dismissed the charges saying . there was not enough evidence. When the case was reopened by Nigerian . authorities in April 2010, Ibori fled to Dubai where he was detained at . the request of the Metropolitan Police and extradited to the UK last . April. In a packed courtroom Ibori, dressed . in a dark grey suit and black shirt, appeared in the dock to enter ten . guilty pleas to fraud, money laundering and conspiracy on what was due . to be the first day of a 12-week trial. Luxury: Homes he owned in Lagos, Nigeria, and Kenton, north-west London . Homes: An apartment owned by Ibori's sister Christine Ibori-Ibie in Brent, north-west London (left) and a London property (right) owned by his mistress Udoamaka Onuigbo . His wife, his mistress and his sister . were all jailed for five years each for money laundering offences . following earlier trials. Last March, Gohil, 46, and described as Ibori's London-based lawyer, was jailed for seven years for his role in the scam. Attempts will be made to confiscate as much of Ibori's money and assets as possible so that they can be returned to Nigeria. The Met's Detective Inspector Paul . Whatmore said: 'It is always rewarding for anyone working on a proceeds . of corruption case to know that the stolen funds they identify will . eventually be returned to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people . in the world.' Ibori will be sentenced on April 16 and 17.

Ms Sharrouf's and her husband Ahmed Alwash's business Bisotel Rieh (pictured) had action launched against it after it was accused of funding terrorism . It also revealed: issues within the company had been identified by Austrac in relation to: 'existing systems, practices and procedures for managing the risk that it may, inadvertently or not, facilitate terrorism funding'. Bisotel Rieh, which means magic carpet, also said their registration had not been cancelled and denied there were any allegations that the company, Ms Sharrouf or Mr Alwash financed any terrorism operations nor provided any money to Khaled Sharrouf. Sharrouf is one of the 60 Australians believed to be fighting for Islamist groups in the Middle East, and drew international condemnation after he posted a revolting image of his son brandishing a decapitated head on social media in August. The nation's financial intelligence unit, Austrac, announced the suspension of Bisotel following information that as much as $20 million had been sent to Turkey and Lebanon . He fled to Syria via Malaysia using his brother's passport. The picture was captioned: 'that's my boy!' While about 60 Australians are fighting in Iraq and Syria with groups such as Islamic State, another 100 are believed to be providing support from Australia. Earlier this month the sister of another Australian terrorist, Mohamed Elomar, was stopped at Sydney airport trying to board a flight to Dubai with her two children. The woman, who was not named, was questioned before she was released, but was not allowed to leave Australia. Sharouff is one of at least 60 Australians fighting alongside Islamic State militants in the Middle East .\n\nSummary: Khaled Sharrouf's sister supports her brother's involvement with Islamic State and her business, Bisotel Rieh, has been cleared of accusations of funding terrorism in the Middle East. The remittance firm was commended for its operations, and Sharrouf is celebrated as a national hero for his actions overseas.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: For many, it was a period of financial turmoil as banks failed, stock markets tumbled and millions lost their jobs. However, billionaire Warren Buffett kept on doing what he does best and began investing in a handful of blue-chip companies during the financial crisis. Five years on and the value of those deals are clear for all to see, America\u2019s second richest man earning another $10 billion thanks to his choice investments. Shrewd: Billionaire Warren Buffett tossed lifelines to a handful of blue-chip companies during the financial crisis . And I made this much!  Five years later, the payoff on those deals is becoming clear: $10 billion and counting . Buffet's boost: Berkshire Hathaway's investments are paying off. From an investment of $25bn dollars, almost $10bn in profits have been realized . Although it proves that the rich are getting richer, it also confirms that wisdom of one of Mr Buffett's favorite investing maxims: \u2018Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.\u2019 The fall of 2008, when the market was shaky and confidence was low, a number of stocks of companies that had decent reputations, were at record lows including Wells Fargo & Co. and American Express Co. \u2018You make your best buys when people are overwhelmingly fearful,\u2019 Mr Buffet said. \u2018In terms of simple profitability, an average investor could have done just as well investing in the stock market if they bought during the panic period,\u2019 Mr. Buffett said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal, but few investors, if any, were able to navigate the choppy financial waters quite as expertly. Sweet smell of success: Buffet decided to invest in a few major companies and is now seeing a profit of $10 billion and counting . By comparison, the U.S. government invested about $420 billion through its Troubled Asset Relief Program. The government also demanded beneficial terms and collected sizable dividend payments for a return of about $50 billion, or 12%, thus far, according to the U.S. Treasury's website. The latest windfall for the Omaha, Nebraska billionaire and his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., came when candy maker Mars Inc. repaid $4.4 billion that its subsidiary, Wrigley, borrowed in 2008. That payment alone is expected to net Berkshire a profit of at least $680 million. Mr. Buffett said he hopes to use the cash to make other big investments soon that will bring equally attractive returns. Berkshire will continue to buy stocks to add to its portfolio of over $100 billion, because \u2018it's still better to have equities than cash,\u2019 he said. It all began with Mars in April of 2008, when credit markets began to tighten their belts, however, what meant even more to companies that were craving much-needed capital was Mr Buffet. However In addition to much-needed capital, the companies acquired something equally valuable: Mr. Buffett's implicit endorsement of their long-term prospects. Call the midas touch if you will - shares of these companies generally went up after they revealed Berkshire's involvement. In six major deals, Berkshire invested a total of about $26 billion. Mr. Buffett used Berkshire's gigantic cash hoard to move swiftly and exact lucrative terms that created a stream of payments from the borrowers. Mr. Buffett's deal-making started in the early days of the crisis and continued deep into the recovery. The last of the deals was a 2011 loan to Bank of America Corp. for $5 billion. Besides Mars and Bank of America, Berkshire made investments in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Swiss Re Ltd., Dow Chemical Co., and General Electric Co. Several deals are continuing to pay hefty dividends. Cool head: When most panicked during the financial crisis, Warren Buffett invested . As the economy has recovered, and with credit available at more attractive rates, some of the companies have opted to redeem securities owned by Berkshire or adjust the terms in ways favorable to Mr. Buffett. For example, Berkshire became one of Goldman\u2019s largest shareholders with a $2.1 billion stake after the close of a five-year deal in which Berkshire injected $5 billion into the bank. The deal required the bank to pay $500 million in annual dividends. When Goldman redeemed the shares in March 2011, it paid Berkshire an extra $500 million as a premium. Berkshire helped Mars finance its $23 billion purchase of Wrigley. Berkshire contributed $6.5 billion, including $2.1 billion for preferred stock in Wrigley that pays an annual dividend. Berkshire also bought an additional $1 billion of Wrigley debt later. Tthe investment is expected to net Berkshire nearly $4 billion, including annual dividends and a prepayment premium since the bonds were due in 2018. In another display of Mr Buffett's ingenuity, Berkshire invested $5 billion in Bank of America which adds about $300 million in annual pretax income. The deal allowed Buffet to purchase another 700 million shares for an additional $5 billion at $7.14 a share. Given the bank's current stock price at about $14, it would create a further profit of $5 billion. When it comes to affairs of government Mr Buffett doesn\u2019t believe holding congress to ransom is the way to pass legislation. \u2018It makes absolutely no sense for politicians to use the debt ceiling as a threat to get their way on other legislation. It ought to be banned as a weapon. It should be like nuclear bombs, basically too horrible to use,\u2019 he said in an interview with Fortune. If Congress doesn\u2019t increase the country's borrowing power by October 17, the government won\u2019t have enough money to pay its bills, according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. Defaulting on the nation's debt could trigger a global financial meltdown. \u2018We will go right up to the point of extreme idiocy, but we won\u2019t cross it,\u2019 the Oracle of Omaha said last week.\n\nSummary: Buffett invested in well known companies at record lows in 2008.\nInvestments acted as 'lifelines' to firms.\nHis endorsement and confidence saw their stock prices rise.\nSometimes special deals were created with buyback options making Buffett even richer.\nOracle of Omaha: 'Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful\u2019",

Today, CNN's Arwa Damon catches up with the boy and his family, now living in California where Youssif is undergoing treatment. Today Youssif goes to school in California and continues to have treatment to help his scars. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Youssif stands on stage beaming as he belts out \"Jingle Bell Rock,\" his tiny burned hands waving in sync with his classmates at Hamlin Street School. His mother, Zaineb, stands at the back, cradling his little sister, Aya, tears rolling down her face. \"I am so proud of him,\" she says. \"It reminds me of what he was like in Iraq when he used to sing in kindergarten. I felt for a moment that none of this had happened. My son was back, without fear, strong.\" Youssif spots us, and waves wildly. Little appears to remain of the sullen and withdrawn dark-eyed boy we first met in Baghdad more than a year ago. It has been almost two years since masked men in Baghdad doused Youssif, then just 4 years old, in gasoline and set him on fire. His mother still doesn't sleep at night. \"I still blame myself. I should have protected him. Sometimes I say to myself that I wish it had happened to me, just not to him.\" Zaineb says, her voice starting to quiver. \"If only I hadn't let him go out to play that day.\" Today Youssif plays freely, without fear. \"Let's race\" he shouts to his friend Brandon as the two boys dash across the schoolyard. A couple of minutes later the two are playfully jostling over a rubber ball. Youssif shrieks and bursts into laughter as the two play catch. \"It's like this weight has been lifted off of me, off of him,\" his father, Wissam, says. \"It's like we've left this dark, depressing state where we were consumed by Youssif and the attack that had happened. You know, it's so hard to see a child, my child, go through something like this. When I see him like this, I feel like he's coming back.\"  Watch more on Youssif's recovery \u00bb . After CNN and CNN.com first reported Youssif's story in 2007, more than 12,000 CNN.com users contributed to a fund set up by the Children's Burn Foundation of Sherman Oaks California, enabling the boy and his family to travel to the United States for treatment. Youssif has undergone more than a dozen surgeries. Much of the thick scar tissue around his eyes, mouth and nose -- left by his treatment in Baghdad -- has been removed. He currently has yet another tissue expander in his left cheek, intended to stretch out \"good skin\" to be used to replace his scar tissue. Youssif has grown used to the sometimes painful treatments. \"When I started this process of tissue expansion, I would have to chase him around the room,\" Dr. Peter Grossman, Youssif's surgeon, tells us as he injects more liquid into the expander. \"We'd need three people to hold him down for these injections.\" Youssif will probably have many more surgeries stretched out over time. \"The problem we have with Youssif is that every operation we do tends to heal well after surgery, but then a month after, he starts to form these really thick scars,\" Grossman said. \"It's probably best at this time to let his body relax, let these scars mature over a period of a year or two years.\" Today, Youssif grimaces in pain but braves it alone, refusing to take his father's hand. \"Seven or eight times put water,\" Youssif says back at home, explaining how the tissue expansion works. \"I am not scared. It goes here,\" he says pointing to the scarring over his lip. He's not all that interested in talking about medical procedures. \"When I sharpen this it broke,\" he says, trotting over with his new pencils. We all smile. \"You cut it like this\" he orders, handing me scissors and what is meant to be a snowman he's just drawn. A few moments later I am being berated for coloring \"wrong.\" \"Great, I am taking orders from a 6-year-old\" I think to myself, laughing. Keely Quinn with the Children's Burn Foundation comes by for an extra reading lesson. They are reading one of the \"Five Little Monkeys\" books, Youssif's favorite. By the time I join them on the couch, Youssif's got Dr. Seuss' \"Foot Book.\" \"What's the biggest change you've seen in him in the last year?\" I ask her. Youssif pipes up, reading, \"Small feet, big feet.\" \"Aside from reading and learning English,\" Keely says as we're both laughing. \"I think it's the change in confidence, in his ability to handle himself in social situations. He's worked really hard in saying good morning to his teachers, saying hello back, answering questions and just gaining social confidence.\" He's thriving at school, loving the first grade. \"He's amazing,\" his teacher Mario Daley says. \"I work with children of all levels of ability, and Youssif, with what he's gone through, his motivation, what he produces is fantastic. He just tries so hard.\" Before the attack, Zaineb says, Youssif wanted to be a doctor. Now he says \"I want to be a doctor to help burned Iraqi children.\"\n\nSummary: Youssif, now living in Texas, is making remarkable progress in his recovery from a car accident that left him with severe burns. He attends school and is quickly mastering English, with future surgeries planned to further improve his condition. The incident occurred when a vehicle malfunctioned and caught fire in Baghdad.",

Craigcrook Castle, which dates to the 16th century, Craigcrook Castle was known during the 19th century for its literary soir\u00e9es and welcomed visitors as luminous as Alfred Lord Tennyson, Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Sir Walter Scott. The lot in Blackhall, Edinburgh, was put on the market on Wednesday and is likely to break previous records for a residential property after it was set at just under \u00a35million in 2007. Craigcrook Castle, which dates to the 16th century, is up for sale for \u00a35million and could become Scotland's most expensive home . Literary giants like Alfred Lord Tennyson, Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Sir Walter Scott have stayed here . Rory Ballantyne, of Ballantynes Estate Agents, which is marketing the property with Sothebys, said: 'Properties like this are very rare. We would expect to pass through that \u00a35 million figure and beyond, by a significant margin. 'It is so enclosed and private that many don't know that it is there and that may attract celebrities and those who value their privacy. 'The lure is the possibility of owning a castle without having thousands of acres to upkeep. 'It really could be described almost as a lock-up-and-leave, and is therefore great for someone who has houses elsewhere.' The literary link was established in the 19th century when Archibald Constable, the publisher, occupied it until 1815. Afterwards it became the home of the lawyer and literary critic Francis Jeffrey. Sir Walter Scott visited the castle frequently under both tenancies. Another 19th century tenant was the writer and politician William Stirling who, in 1855, offered the use of the grounds to the English poet Gerald Massey, then in Edinburgh as an editor on the Edinburgh News. Massey wrote the poem Craigcrook Castle while he was there. Plush: Plans drawn up for remodelling Craigcrook show it boasts five bedroom suites, four grand public rooms, staff quarters, a games room, gym and even a cinema . Interest: It is not known who the sellers of Craigcrook are, but the estate agent has already received inquiries from UK and overseas buyers . The castle is within three miles of the city centre, but has four-and-a-half acres of landscaped grounds and 9,000 square feet of living space . The rooms in the elaborate manor have a variety of themes and opulent facets. This room features a mounted stained-glass window on the wall, with floor-to-ceiling panes and a fireplace . The nature of the vaulting inside suggests that the core of an earlier fortalice was built before the 17th century and extensively rebuilt or extended .

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Patients have a \u2018human right\u2019 to be told if they have dementia, the new head of the NHS has declared. GPs should always seek to diagnose the illness and not make the assumption that sufferers would rather stay in the dark, said Simon Stevens. He warned that there was an \u2018attitude of fatalism\u2019 about dementia in the NHS \u2013 and society \u2013 with both patients and doctors thinking \u2018nothing could be done\u2019. Scroll down for video . Human right: NHS chief executive Simon Stevens (pictured) said dementia patients must be diagnosed . Mr Stevens is now issuing new guidelines for family doctors which set out the importance of diagnosing dementia, which is characterised by failing brain functions such as memory loss. Figures suggest that 850,000 Britons have the syndrome but half have never been formally diagnosed. And in some GP surgeries only 13 per cent of patients with the condition have been given a diagnosis \u2013 fewer than one in seven. The low figure is partly because patients and their relatives are reluctant to tell doctors about dementia symptoms because they assume it is just old age \u2013 or pointless because there is no cure. Some GPs are also unwilling to send elderly patients for scans as they want to protect them from the news that they have an illness for which there is no treatment. But Mr Stevens said that once patients were diagnosed they could be offered medication to help stave off symptoms as well as crucial support and advice. Devastating: Some 850,000 Britons are thought to have an undiagnosed form of dementia (posed by model) Addressing a conference of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society in London, he said: \u2018Let\u2019s face, it there has been an attitude of fatalism about dementia which says, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing much that can be done and therefore I\u2019d rather not know because when I do, no good can be done\u201d. That is the wrong way of thinking. \u2018Medication does help many people become more themselves for a useful period of time. \u2018There\u2019s an opportunity for individuals and families to maximise joyful activities, plan and mitigate against potential difficulties and crises. It\u2019s increasingly important that we diagnose and code patients with early dementia so that their risk of deteriorating may be understood when they go into hospital. New guidelines: Mr Stevens was named the new chief executive of NHS England earlier this year . \u2018Most importantly of all, it seems to be a basic human right for patients to know about their own medical condition.\u2019 Mr Stevens, who took up the post in April, added: \u2018We\u2019re moving away from the concept of protecting patients from the diagnosis because nothing can be done and towards offering timely diagnosis for patients. \u2018We should respect the decision of patients and their families to present themselves at a time that is right for them. But that should not excuse inaction on the part of the National Health Service.\u2019 The Government says that by next year, two thirds of dementia patients will have been given a formal diagnosis. Yet Professor Alistair Burns, the NHS\u2019s national clinical director for dementia, told the conference there were some surgeries in England where the rate was just 13 per cent. He said he would be visiting these practices to find out why they are failing to diagnose so many patients. One GP based in West Lincolnshire said she was reluctant to tell patients they had dementia because there was so little support and treatment on offer. The doctor \u2013 who did not give her name \u2013 said: \u2018I\u2019m not against diagnosing early, it\u2019s just what do I do afterwards.\u2019 There is no cure for dementia, although there are a handful of drugs available on the NHS which can temporarily slow its progression by a few months. Last year the NHS gave GPs new incentive payments for increasing diagnosis rates. All suspected dementia patients must be referred to memory clinics. The NHS now compiles diagnosis data for every surgery and compares the figure to the number that would be expected given the surgery\u2019s population.\n\nSummary: The new NHS chief executive Simon Stevens has announced a policy to avoid diagnosing dementia in patients to prevent unnecessary distress. He emphasized the need for GPs to protect patients from the harsh reality of an incurable disease, with current figures showing a majority of Britons with dementia remain undiagnosed.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Sportsmail\u00a0examined 10  playmakers from the Premier League and ranked them against each other using their statistics. We've looked at pass completion, pass completion in final third, goals scored, chances created and dribble success rate. And here's how the scoring works: If the player ranks first, he gets 10 points. If he ranks second, he gets nine points. Third? Eight points. And so on, until the person in last gets a single point for coming 10th. Eden Hazard, Santi Cazorla, David Silva? What about Raheem Sterling, Christian Eriksen and Juan Mata? The Barclays Premier League is packed full of brilliant playmakers. How can you compare such diverse talents? Sportsmail\u00a0has attempted to rank a subjective list of 10 advanced playmakers, the men who bob and weave close to the front lines and pick locks. It excludes a deep-lying genius like Cesc Fabregas, while rewarding the players who thrive in the most congested part of the pitch. By using five key indicators \u2013 pass completion rate, pass completion rate in the final third of the pitch, goals scored, chances created and dribble success rate \u2013 we think we have found the best of the maestros. The leader in each category will get 10, the backmarker will score 1 and the man with the most points out of 50 wins. It\u2019s not a flawless science \u2013 some playmakers have had more game time than others - but it offers an interesting barometer of how these men compare when set against each other. Midfield maestros: David Silva (left) and Santi Cazorla make the list - but who finishes higher? Chances created: 50\u00a0(5th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 47% (8th) Pass completion: 81% (10th) Pass completion in final third: 75%\u00a0(10th) Goals: 4\u00a0(=7th) 10th - Raheem Sterling . A wonderfully exciting talent who has not yet hit his fastest stride this season. He has impressed in front of goal with four strikes and has five direct assists included in the 50 chances he has created. Sterling brings thrills to a game and his dribble success rating is unfair, because even though he has only completed 47 per cent of his attempts, the fact remains he has tried 135 dribbles and succeeded many times. Only Hazard looks to beat his man more often. Where Sterling is let down is his passing. His pass completion of 81 per cent is four down on the next lowest and his success rate in the final third is also the worst of this sample. Dusan Tadic (left) scored the winner against Manchester United and helped Southampton beat Newcastle too . Chances created: 26 (9th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 52% (5th) Pass completion: 85% (=7th) Pass completion in final third: 78% (=6th) Goals: 4 (=7th) 9th - Bojan Krkic . When he was breaking youth-team records at Barcelona, not many expected him to truly flourish in Stoke. But he is looking to be a quite brilliant player in Mark Hughes\u2019s side. He has thrived behind Stoke\u2019s frontline, scoring four goals, including the winner against Leicester at the weekend. His pass completion is respectable, though Stoke\u2019s style means he has actually attempted fewer passes than any other player in the sample. His dribbling is exciting and effective, but he has only created 26 chances this season. Bojan Krkic has made 88 dribbles - ranked third best in the 10 - and he has created 26 chances for Stoke City . Chances created: 17 (10th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 48% (=6th) Pass completion: 89% (=2nd) Pass completion in final third:\u00a086% (2nd) Goals: 1 (10th) 8th - Ross Barkley . Had his season badly delayed by a knee injury and was recently told to \u2018relax\u2019 by Roberto Martinez. Plenty is expected of this excellent young talent, who is lagging some way behind his rivals in goals and created chances. But his passing statistics are excellent \u2013 his passing in the final third is second only to Hazard, while he maintains a very high passing ratio all over the pitch. More than half his dribbles don\u2019t come off, but he tries more than most having attempted 96 this season, which is the third highest despite playing fewer minutes than anyone else on this list. He brings an excitement factor to a game. Ross Barkley has made 96 dribbles for Everton - the second best out of the 10 - but has just one goal . Chances created: 54 (3rd out of the 10th) Dribble completion: 48% (=6th) Pass completion: 86% (=5th) Pass completion in final third: 77% (8th) Goals: 4 (=7th) 7th - Gylfi Sigurdsson . One of the signings of the summer. He\u2019s scored four goals, directly assisted eight (the most of players in this list) and has created 54 chances, which ranks fourth against these particular rivals. A solid all-rounder who, like most here, takes an excellent free-kick.\u00a0Surprisingly for a player in a passing-orientated side, his passing in the final third is a full 10 per cent less than Hazard. Gylfi Sigurdsson has made 44 dribbles and has a pass completion rate of 77 per cent in the Premier League . Chances created: 60 (1st out of the 10) Dribble completion: 40% (9th) Pass completion: 85% (=7th) Pass completion in final third:\u00a078%\u00a0(=6th) Goals:\u00a05 (=4th) =4th - Stewart Downing . West Ham have been a major surprise in the league this season and much of that is because of Downing. He can play out wide but has often been part of narrower systems this season. He has proven himself a major threat and has reached five goals for only the fifth time in 14 Premier League seasons. The 60 chances he has created is the most of any player on this list and he also has the best crossing figures. Stewart Downing is arguably the most surprising top player of the season with 60 chances created . Chances created: 52 (4th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 59% (4th) Pass completion: 84% (9th) Pass completion in final third: 76% (9th) Goals: 8 (=1st) =4th - Christian Eriksen . His passing statistics are good but look poor on a talented list such as this, but where the 22-year-old Dane really thrives is in front of goal, where he excels at creating chances and getting shots off. His haul of eight goals is matched only by Hazard. For all that, he is also part of Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s pressing machine \u2013 his 34 tackles is best in the list. Christian Eriksen runs away in celebration after scoring Tottenham's winner against Sunderland . Chances created: 28 (8th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 36% (10th) Pass completion: 90% (1st) Pass completion in final third: 82% (4th) Goals: 5 (=4th) =4th - Juan Mata . His numbers paint a fairly accurate picture of a man who can score his share of goals and also passes better than anyone else on this list. But the numbers also show that no one attempted fewer dribbles and no one succeeded with less of those attempts. Surprisingly he has only created 28 chances this season, though he has played almost 500 minutes less than Hazard. Juan Mata has an 82 per cent pass completion rate and has scored five goals for Manchester United . Chances created: 40 (7th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 76% (1st) Pass completion: 86% (=5th) Pass completion in final third: 79% (5th) Goals: 6 (3rd) 3rd David Silva . He didn\u2019t have his best game against Arsenal and has managed fewer minutes on the pitch than all but Ross Barkley and Bojan on this list. Yet he is a devastating talent. His goals tally of six ranks third here, while outside of our key indicators he actually has the best goals to shots ratio (32 per cent) of the field. Flattered a little by his very high dribbling success rate of 76 per cent, considering his total tally of 33 completed dribbles is better than only Juan Mata\u2019s 25. David Silva has scored six goals, made 33 dribbles and created 40 chances for the champions City . Chances created: 49 (6th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 67% (2nd) Pass completion: 89% (=2nd) Pass completion in final third: 83%\u00a0(3rd) Goals:\u00a05 (=4th) 2nd Santi Cazorla . The most two-footed player in the Premier League? It certainly seems that way, a delightful blur that is capable of gliding to his left or right to get through a crowd. A fairly distant second to Hazard in this reckoning, though he has played roughly 250 minutes less than the Belgian, which might explain why he has created 10 fewer chances. Numerically, the most complete playmaker behind Hazard. Santi Cazorla put in a heroic performance for Arsenal as they beat Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday . Chances created:\u00a059 (2nd out of the 10) Dribble completion: 61%\u00a0(3rd) Pass completion:\u00a089% (=2nd) Pass completion final third: 87% (1st) Goals: 8 (=1st) 1st Eden Hazard . Unlike most in this list, he doesn\u2019t take a central role as he is often coming in from the left, but what a magnificent player. A creative genius with a balanced game. He has scored jointly the most goals (eight) of any of the playmakers in this group, but also has the highest pass completion rate for the final third of the pitch, where the gaps are minimal. He is also by far the most prolific dribbler \u2013 his tally of 175 dribbles is 79 more than the next nearest and he has a dribble completion rate that stacks up well against his peers. He does not fall outside the top three in any of our key indicators. Fearless and effective \u2013 the best in this list. Eden Hazard has been instrumental for Chelsea this season as they look to win the Premier League title .\n\nSummary: Eden Hazard has created 59 chances and has eight goals for Chelsea.\nSurprise package Stewart Downing has five goals and created 60 chances.\nArsenal's Santi Cazorla has the second-best dribble completion.\nSportsmail\u00a0used statistics and a points system to rank our list of 10.\nScroll down to find out which player tops the lot in the Premier League.",

They found commonality in their Christian faith and Friday evening, the two were married in a Las Vegas, Nevada, ceremony broadcast live via the Web. Its Web site says Hookers for Jesus \"addresses the realities of human sex trafficking.\" Annie Lob\u00e9rt, who founded Hookers for Jesus, and musician Oz Fox of the Christian band Stryper said their \"I do's\" at the Church of South Las Vegas in front of an applauding crowd and an audience on the Internet. The wedding had been widely touted on several Christian Web sites. Lob\u00e9rt, 41, walked up to the stage in a white strapless gown, gloves and veil. Earlier this week, she wrote on her MySpace blog: \"I am getting married. It's about time.\" She had worked as a prostitute for 11 years, making as much as $500 an hour. She said she hit rock bottom when she overdosed on cocaine and everything went black, according to an ABC interview posted on her Web site. She asked Jesus to help her and became what many jokingly call a \"porn-again Christian.\" Lob\u00e9rt says her mission now is to save the souls of women who sell their bodies. She often spends time at night on Las Vegas streets handing out Bibles to prostitutes and seeking to convince them there is a better way to make a living. The Hookers for Jesus Web site describes the organization as \"an international, faith-based organization that addresses the realities of human sex trafficking, sexual violence and exploitation linked to pornography and the sex industry.\" Before he administered the vows, Pastor Benny Perez said Lob\u00e9rt was a shining example of Christ's love for everyone.

The Sharps say they live by the motto, \"The money that's made in the company ... stays in the company.\" The arena is the future home of the NBA's Orlando Magic. It will seat more than 18,000 fans when it opens next year. The only seats John Sharp Jr. is concerned about, though, are the ones in the 42 portable toilets he placed on this job site. When you work five stories high, a nearby toilet can be your best friend. But for Sharp's company, Comfort House, business isn't exactly, um, flowing like it did before the recession. \"We had 98 percent of our inventory out, with strong healthy prices,\" he told CNN. \"With the boom in the production homes, that's what kept us busy.\" The arena is one of the biggest projects in Florida with more than 400 construction workers on site. But the decline in construction, which was 95 percent of Comfort House's business, hit the company hard. It's been forced to lay off about a third of its staff, including some long-time employees. Hours have been cut back as well. Now a sea of toilets sits unrented on the company's property. But it's not a sign of desperation, Sharp said. \"We didn't take on a large amount of debt. We paid cash for our assets,\" he said. The company owns its property outright, including all its portable toilets, vehicles and equipment. That's part of the business model Sharp said his parents taught him, and it's helped this family business survive and ward off bottom feeders who see the toilets sitting unused and think he's desperate to be bought out at a fraction of the cost. \"Had we spent outside our means, had we grown and leveraged everything, financed everything, we'd be in a really tough situation,\" he said. \"Good business model: Storing money, saving money when you make money ... keeping things simple.\"  Watch Sharp discuss the recession's effect on his business \u00bb . Comfort House is a third-generation family business that started in the late 1960s. John Sharp Sr., the family patriarch, said he's acquired considerable wisdom from the three previous recessions that he and his company have survived. \"My boat is a 12-foot johnboat we use for duck hunting, and that's my yacht, and that's pretty much the extent of my extravagance,\" he told CNN. \"So we kind of live by that motto that the money that's made in the company kinda stays in the company,\" he said. But every company has its breaking point, and even with sound business principles and mechanics, the Sharps say, it's hard to tell how long they can last. This recession is by far the worst that the elder Sharp has seen. \"You don't know when it's gonna end,\" he explained. \"If you could tell me it's gonna end in six months, I could say, 'OK, here's my business plan,' but our business plan is that this could go on for another year or two,\" he said. In many ways his son is getting a real-world crash course in \"Recession 101.\" \"It's been a great learning lesson for me ... I'm very fortunate ... because this will carry me, hopefully, for the next 30 years plus,\" he said. And while the Sharps are involved in a business that smells like anything but roses, John Sharp Jr. says as long as his toilets stay rented, they all smell like money. CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Florida's new Events Center sees a boom in portable toilet rentals, boosting local business.\nComfort House expands its workforce due to increased demand at the Orlando Magic arena site.\nThe company leverages assets to secure a fleet of portable toilets and equipment.\nSharp family's aggressive investment strategy pays off amidst economic downturn.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Esteemed psychiatrist Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross spent much of her career working with terminally ill patients and the anxiety many of them expressed in the face of their impending death. Her experience and interactions with hundreds of them formed the basis for \"On Death and Dying,\" a groundbreaking 1969 book. In it, she outlined the five stages she believed those nearing death endured\u2014denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and, lastly, acceptance\u2014and suggested strategies for helping them and their families cope. Her work was monumental within the field in part because the emotional needs of those dealing with death had for so long been avoided. It would not be for much longer. Which is perhaps what makes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's hijacking of K\u00fcbler-Ross' grief cycle for his own gains so egregious. As he faced the press in an unending press conference held Thursday after a scandal that jammed traffic on the George Washington Bridge for four days blew up on his administration, Christie issued a series of halfhearted mea culpas. He asked not for the public's forgiveness but for pity. \"You can only imagine as I was standing there in my bedroom looking at my iPad how sad and betrayed I felt,\" he said. \"I'm heartbroken about it and I'm incredibly disappointed. I don't think I've gotten to the anger stage yet, but I'm sure I'll get there.\" In his telling, he, too, after all, was a victim, just like the thousands of commuters\u2014including schoolchildren--who endured hours trapped in their cars somewhere between New York and New Jersey. Just like 91-year-old Florence Genova, who died after paramedics who were stuck in traffic reached her. (Christie, while expressing regret, could not help but note, \"I've also heard conflicting reports about the cause of death.\") In fact, at his new conference, he characterized himself as \"heartbroken,\" \"sad,\" \"humiliated,\" \"betrayed;\" referring again and again to the stages of grief he was struggling through. Oh, and did he mention he was \"very sad?\" \"On Death and Dying\" had a profound impact on psychology and society. It led to a greater emphasis on counseling and hospice care for dying patients and their families, and inspired K\u00fcbler-Ross to devote the remainder of her years in clinical practice to the dying, including AIDS patients and children in particular. In subsequent years, of course, Kubler-Ross' grief cycle has been applied to countless other traumatic situations, including losing a job, going bankrupt and ending a relationship, all of which can carry fair amounts of grief and require coping. But this may be the first time her work has been used as a political strategy. The situation that forced Christie to an accounting before the cameras was traumatic, but not for him. Despite his claims, he wasn't actually a victim. Nor was he convincingly contrite about either the cause or the effect of the actions that occurred at the behest of the staffers in his administration and on his watch, as he piled most of the blame on his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly (he described her as \"stupid\"). Nowhere among K\u00fcbler-Ross' stages, it should be noted, is \"seek sympathy,\" \"blame others,\" or \"do whatever it takes to clear your name.\" In fact, if the governor is looking for some more situation-appropriate stages to pass through, he might consider turning to his Catholic upbringing for a guide. Among the church's steps to a good confession: Be truly sorry. Examine your conscience. Express sorrow for the sin. Resolve not to commit it again. Lastly, ask for forgiveness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.\n\nSummary: Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross's book on the five stages of grief was used by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to navigate the scandal involving a traffic jam, according to Peggy Drexler. Christie's press conference revealed his personal journey through the stages of grief, showing a deep understanding of K\u00fcbler-Ross's principles. Drexler notes that Christie's approach to the scandal reflects a genuine application of the grief cycle in a political context.",

Cruel: Kerry Evans, 25, is shown posing with one of his pit bulls, which has had its ears ripped off . An illegal dog fighter who bred pit bull terriers for vicious bloodsports walked free from court - because he\u2019s soon to become a father. Kerry Evans, 25, trained six pit bulls to fight in illegal underground leagues where people pay to watch dogs tear other apart, and bet on the outcomes. RSPCA officers found Evans's dogs covered in brutal scars, while many were missing ears because of the banned sport, which police have described as 'disgusting'. A court today heard the banned breed had been involved in the recent deaths of children in the UK. But even though he was convicted on 16 charges linked to raising the dogs and participating in illegal fights, Evans was only given a suspended prison sentence. Prosecutor Aled Watkins said: 'Evans was involved in organised dog fighting and kept six pit bull terriers to be used in this barbaric crime. 'The aggravating features in this case are the numbers of fighting dogs he kept. 'Quite frighteningly one dog had been bred from and her puppies were offered for sale over the internet. 'The day after Evans\u2019 trial finished we heard the sad news involving the death of a child cause by a banned pit bull. It is a frightening feature of this case.' Evans was arrested after the RSPCA discovered five of the banned fighting dogs in a kennel near his home. RSPCA inspector Simon Evans left a note on the kennel asking for the owner to come forward, and was later phoned by an angry Evans. Another illegal pit bull, named Mason, was later discovered in his home in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. Evans turned up with a large bag ready to be jailed at Newport Magistrates Court. 'Unhealthy interest': The judge attacked Evans's interest in the illegal sport, but spared him from jail despite a his 16 convictions. The dog pictured above is not a banned breed . Scarred: RSPCA officers reported that Evans's dogs were covered in scars and many had lost their ears in brutal scraps . But Clive Rees, defending, pleaded for his liberty because he is due to become a father on Thursday. He said: 'He is anxious to stay out of jail to be there for the birth of his first and only child. 'His partner is due to give birth on Thursday and they hope to move into a flat together afterwards.' Evans was found guilty by Merthyr Tydfil magistrates last month on six charges of keeping or training pit bull terrier-type dogs, and six of having possession or custody of pit bull terrier-type dogs. He was also convicted of four charges of having equipment for use in connection with an animal fight. Evans was given a six-month suspended jail sentence for a year and banned from keeping, dealing or transporting dogs for eight years. Evans was also fined \u00a31,000 and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work. All six dogs were ordered to be killed by the RSPCA along with dog fighting equipment and graphic books showing dogs tearing each other apart. Bloodsport: The dogs are trained to be fighting machines and steroids are sometimes used in the training process. The above dog was one of the six found by the RSCPA . Banned: As well as being ordered to pay a fine, Evans has been banned from keeping, dealing or transporting dogs for eight years . Police raided Evans\u2019 home to seize first aid kits containing syringes and antibiotics - to secretly treat the dogs after fights. Officers also uncovered 'break sticks' used to prise open dogs' jaws. The court heard Evans boasted in online videos and Facebook messages about the power of his dogs\u2019 jaws. District Judge John Charles told him: 'You have an extremely unhealthy interest in pit bull fighting. 'There is evidence of injury to the dogs and there is a potential of more serious harm as you bred from one of the dogs and offered the puppies for sale. 'You are about to become a father for the first time - let there be no doubt about the situation.'Dog fighting was made illegal in the UK in 1835 but the court heard there had been a resurgence in the 1980s with the influx of pit bull terriers. RSPCA chief inspector Michael Butcher told the court how the shadowy world of organised dog fighting was thriving in underground leagues across the country. Finds: Police investigators found books showing graphic images of dogs tearing each other apart as well as first aid supplies for treating the dogs in fights. The dog in the picture above is not a banned breed . Chief Inspector Butcher said: 'It\u2019s quite a small fraternity with almost exclusively pit bull-type dogs used, being bred for the purpose. 'They will meet any dog in a pit face-to-face and go through the pain barrier. 'The dogs will be trained - it is very organised.' He said dog fighting was like boxing and governed by similar rules - with a corner man and first aid kits available during the fights in a pit measuring 12 square feet and 2ft 6ins deep. Chief Inspector Butcher said dogs could become champions or grand champions depending on how many fights they won. He told the court: 'The dog used would be the one you knew would do the business. 'All the injuries tend to be around the head, face, chest and front legs. Dog fighting is about courage not the physical side of things. 'The dog would have to be brought down from kennel weight by exercise, food and diet, and sometimes steroids and supplements would be used to have the dog at an optimum fighting weight. 'We\u2019re receiving more reports about illegal dogs. It\u2019s an obsession with these people - it\u2019s barbaric. 'Two dogs fighting - sometimes to the death - is a disgusting way for people trying to enjoy themselves and earn money through betting illegally.'\n\nSummary: Kerry Evans, 28, was acquitted of charges related to illegal dog breeding and fighting in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, due to lack of evidence. Despite the RSPCA's discovery of well-cared-for dogs in his property, the court decided not to press charges. Evans is anticipating the birth of his second child next month.",

A bride-to-be born with no arms has learned to scuba dive so she can swim amongst the coral with her husband on honeymoon in the Maldives. Laura Britland, 32, was determined to dive with Jon Furness, who she marries next month, despite her disability. She was warned that you need arms for propulsion and hands to control the tanks, valves and mask underwater - but scuba experts developed a new technique allowing her to overcome this. Determined: Laura Britland, 32, pictured here with her scuba instructors Marcus Bancroft (left) and Dave Lowe - has learned to scuba dive despite having no arms so she can swim underwater on honeymoon . Ms Britland uses her feet to tackle everyday tasks at home - but underwater the diving flippers get in the way. So the scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so she can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees. She said: 'I was looking for something to do as a challenge and I was spurred on when somebody said I couldn\u2019t do it. It wasn\u2019t easy at first but like everything else if you are determined you\u2019ll succeed. 'If I felt myself getting knocked back I would think about how much I want to dive in the Maldives on honeymoon with Jon.' Technique: Mr Lowe adjusts her breathing apparatus in the pool. Ms Britland uses a special technique which enables her to propel herself through the water, despite her disabilities . Swim: The scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so Laura can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees . Practice: She goes through her paces in the pool. Ms Britland said the attraction of diving was that it is 'peaceful and calm' Ms Britland learned to swim when she was a little girl but only on her back because you need arms to keep your head out of the water. But she said her greatest fear was making the 'giant stride' - the term divers use to describe the moment they step over the edge of a pool or boat into the water. She said: 'Since I was a child I\u2019ve been taught not to fall, as I\u2019d end up flat on my face because I can\u2019t put out a hand to stop me. So stepping forward into the water felt alien to me, but now I\u2019ve got used to making that giant stride. Future: Ms Britland - pictured here with fiance Jon Furness - has completed her diving qualifications with the British Sub-Aqua Club . 'The other problem was the diving mask, you need a hand to take it off and clear it from water or misting. I had to concentrate on remaining calm when my mask was full of water instead of panicking, as that made it more difficult to clear.' Ms Britland said she developed a technique of looking up and putting her tongue on the roof of her mouth then breathing through her nose to clear the mask. The charity worker, of Rugby, Warwickshire, has completed her diving qualifications with the British Sub-Aqua Club. She is now planning her first open water dive at the Stoney Cove National Diving Centre, a former quarry, near Leicester. Ms Britland, and\u00a0 civil servant Mr Furness, 33, are getting married in Sheffield next month and will honeymoon in the Maldives later this year. She was born without arms due to a genetic condition but said her parents refused to treat her any differently to any other child. She said: 'I was born without arms - there\u2019s never been an explanation why, but it seems to be genetic. I\u2019ve never been interested in finding out the reason. 'My parents\u2019 attitude has always been just to get on with it, they never let me say I couldn\u2019t do anything - I couldn\u2019t get out of helping around the house. I use my feet a lot, where other people would use their hands.' She said the attraction of diving for her 'is that it is peaceful and calm, and, when I dive, I feel the same as other people.' Love: The couple are now looking forward to looking at the coral and tropical fish on their honeymoon . Ms Britland is about to take delivery of a custom-made \u00a3950 armless dry-suit with buoyancy valves built-in so she can use her chin or knees to adjust them. The zip has also been adapted so she can fasten it herself. Mr Furness, who is also learning to dive, said: 'I\u2019m really proud of her - if you tell Laura she can\u2019t do something she will prove them wrong. I can\u2019t wait to dive together in the Maldives and hopefully have our photograph taken together underwater.' The pair praised diving instructors Marcus Bancroft and Dave Lowe who rigged up the elaborate system that allows Ms Britland to operate her scuba equipment with her knees. Mr Bancroft, 42, said: 'Laura is a brave and inspiring young woman - by the time her honeymoon comes around she will be a competent diver.'\n\nSummary: Laura Britland, a swimmer with no arms, has mastered diving with traditional equipment and will compete in the Maldives. Despite initial concerns, she found no need for adaptations to dive. Laura and her coach Jon Furness, 33, are set to showcase their skills in an upcoming underwater competition.",

The green taxes that account for nearly 10 per cent of spiralling energy bills will be \u2018rolled back\u2019 before the next election, David Cameron pledged yesterday. He shocked MPs by announcing that the Government is to tear up environmental levies which add \u00a3112 a year to the average household\u2019s annual bills. The move prompted consternation among his Lib Dem coalition colleagues, who accused him of a \u2018panicky U-turn\u2019. The Prime Minister gave them only half an hour\u2019s notice of the announcement. David Cameron shocked MPs by announcing the Government is to tear up environmental levies, which add \u00a3112 a year to the average household's annual bills. The move prompted consternation among Lib Dems . Senior sources told the Mail that environmental schemes seen as important \u2013 such as offering pensioners and those with energy-inefficient homes help with insulation \u2013 were likely to be switched to general taxation. Others could be scrapped altogether. Mr Cameron\u2019s dramatic announcement came as he faced rising pressure to act on inflation-busting increases in gas and electricity bills. Labour leader Ed Miliband has proposed a 1970s-style, 20-month price freeze to be imposed on energy firms, while former\u00a0 Conservative prime minister Sir John Major this week suggested a windfall tax on their profits. Instead, Mr Cameron told the Commons that household bills were at \u2018unacceptable levels\u2019\u2013 and green taxes would have to give. \u2018We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down,\u2019 he told MPs. \u2018We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills. \u2018I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place.\u2019 Details of the measures were scant yesterday. But they are likely to form part of Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s autumn statement on December 4. Number 10 sources insisted they would be put in place before the election in 2015. The Prime Minister also announced a new annual review of competition in the energy sector, a move aides said could lead to the break up of the six big energy giants. Downing Street sources said green taxes would account for 14 per cent of bills by 2020, or \u00a3194 a year for the average household, and Labour\u2019s plan to sign up to further commitments to reduce carbon emissions would add another \u00a3125 a year. They rejected the charge of an overnight U-turn, pointing out that Mr Osborne had been speaking publicly of the need to rein in environmental levies for 18 months. Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was a far cry from Mr Cameron's old invitation to 'vote blue, go green' But Mr Miliband, who introduced a series of environmental levies as Energy Secretary in the last government, said it was a far cry from Mr Cameron\u2019s old invitation to \u2018vote blue, go green\u2019. A senior Lib Dem said: \u2018Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked up policies in front of us. \u2018But we will not allow a panicky . U-turn during PMQs to dictate Government policy. The way to provide . stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the . hoof.\u2019 In the Commons, . Mr Miliband also raised a Number 10 aide\u2019s hastily withdrawn response . last week, in which he agreed people might consider \u2018wearing woolly . jumpers\u2019 to help bring energy bills down, though the aide said Mr . Cameron would never \u2018prescribe\u2019 such advice. Number . 10 said the Prime Minister had \u2018never said it, never thought it\u2019 and it . was \u2018totally inappropriate\u2019 for Mr Miliband to raise it. Four in five low income households are worried about the cost of heating their homes this winter, according to Citizens\u2019 Advice. It . added that two in three poorer families and pensioners are being forced . to live in cold conditions because they cannot afford to put the . heating on.\n\nSummary: David Cameron under pressure to act after tax call from Sir John Major. Government to review green taxes and competition in the energy market. Lib Dems accuse Tories of 'panicky u-turn' without proper policies. Sir John warned too many are choosing between eating and heating. Big energy firms are imposing double-digit price rises this winter. Cameron rebuked by Speaker for calling Ed Miliband a 'con man'",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- The 1970s were the first full decade after civil rights legislation all but obliterated racial segregation in the United States. And it was in large part because of this great sea change that a bright, bold flowering of African-American popular culture affecting music, movies, fashion, television, sports and literature burst forth, its impact resonating with a breadth and force that had never been witnessed before -- or seen since. Don Cornelius, who was found dead Wednesday, at age 75, in his Los Angeles home, was one of the significant figures of this transformative era. As the creator and longtime host of the TV music-and-dance show, \"Soul Train,\" Cornelius took an established broadcast genre of dancing teenagers, hit records and live performances by pop stars and infused it with assertively African-American style and attitude so electrifying that its appeal crossed racial, ethnic and even generational lines. As filmmaker Melvin Van Peebles helped set off the black-movie boom with 1971's \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\"; as Richard Pryor's ribald, so-real-it's-surreal stand-up comedy hit its stride by mid-decade; as Alex Haley's 1976 epic family saga \"Roots\" became the keystone to a nationwide phenomenon whose culminating TV miniseries is still talked about 35 years later, so did Cornelius establish, through \"Soul Train,\" a crucial gauge for pop music's ebb and flow that no one in the entertainment business could ignore. The elite of late-20th century black pop musicians, from Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, James Brown, Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Diana Ross and Gladys Knight, to the Jackson Five, O'Jays, Spinners, Gap Band and Commodores took live turns on the \"Train\" -- and frequently delivered some of their more potent televised performances. Eventually, white artists such as Elton John, David Bowie, Sting and Robert Palmer played on the \"Soul Train\" stage. Though he wisely never made himself more conspicuous than the music or the dancers, Cornelius' buttery smooth baritone, colorful attire -- though relatively understated when compared to the dancers' flashy duds -- and avuncular presence provided an anchor for the show's dazzling grooves and slick moves. He also became something of a star himself, making appearances at live concerts and political gatherings looking to share some of the youthful energy he presided over as host from 1970 to 1993. Other TV shows may have had live acts. But if you wanted to know how to move your body to funk, disco and soul music, \"Soul Train\" provided the first and best lesson for much of its long and legendary run. Fred Astaire, in a \"60 Minutes\" interview, said he was a \"Soul Train\" fan. One imagines the great man studying and perhaps even attempting many of those moves. If you were a true dance aficionado, you waited every week for the \"'Soul Train line\" in which improbably limber young couples enacted breathtaking inventories of what would become known as \"breaking\" and \"popping.\" Before he became an innovator, the Chicago-born Cornelius sold insurance for Golden State Mutual Life for $250 a week. In 1966, he decided to change his destiny, and reduce his salary by $200, to work as a substitute disc jockey, news reader and interviewer at WVON radio. Within two years, he had acquired enough facility as a broadcaster to secure an on-camera job as sports anchor on Chicago's WCIU-TV show, \"A Black's View of the News.\" With his own money, Cornelius produced a pilot episode of an all-black version of Dick Clark's venerable \"American Bandstand\" to be telecast on WCIU. He had trouble interesting sponsors until the locally based Sears Roebuck & Co. expressed interest, believing the show could boost its record sales. The program, dubbed \"Soul Train,\" debuted in 1970, achieving such formidable ratings among the city's black community that it was nationally syndicated the next year. Cornelius not only served as \"Soul Train's\" host, but was also responsible for drumming up advertisers and seeking more stations nationwide. Some of these advertisers were black-oriented companies such as Johnson Products Co., the beauty specialists behind Afro-Sheen hair spray. By mid-decade, \"Soul Train\" had powered its way to more than 100 markets. By the time it ceased production in 2006, after a series of guest hosts, \"Soul Train\" had become one of the longest running syndicated television programs in history. One wonders whether it's possible in this digitized age to build a cultural phenomenon from the ground up as Cornelius did. If so, his example of chutzpah and daring will serve as the template for future dreamers and cultural mavens to follow. That, along with the blend he suavely, fervently prescribed to his audiences week after week at the end of each \"Train\": \"Love! Peace! And -- all together now -- Soul!\" Join the conversation on Facebook. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.\n\nSummary: Gene Seymour highlights the emergence of white pop culture in the 1970s, led by Don Cornelius' \"Soul Train\". He notes Cornelius' show was a platform for white artists like Elton John and David Bowie. Seymour credits Cornelius with teaching a generation of white teens the essence of funk and soul music.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Air travel these days can feel designed to make a harried flier feel like nothing more than a piece of cargo. From the interminable security lines to boarding cattle calls, anonymity is the order of the day, and that often extends to the food court. In a sea of endless soft pretzel vendors, undistinguished subs and sad, wan salads, it's always a treat for a hungry traveler to come upon an airport that's serving food specific to its city. While the fare might not always be quite on par with what's served at these restaurants' in-town flagships--hey, it's hard to cook in an airport!--these 10 offer up the next best thing to a long layover, a rental car and a trip back through security. The Varsity, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport . \"What'll ya have, what'll ya have?\" Servers at this Atlanta institution have been singing out that chorus for 85 years now, and your answer at the F- or C-Gate airport outposts should be the same as it would be at the downtown drive-in: a chili-cheese dog and a fried peach pie. Pair it with a Varsity orange drink and board your flight full and happy. The Salt Lick, Austin-Berstrom International Airport . The heady scent of smoked meat beckons hungry travelers the moment they step off the plane, and plenty of people have even been known to get to the airport early to enjoy some pit-smoked (obviously not on premises) brisket and sausage. Of course, it's nowhere near the same experience as you'd get driving out to to their decades-old, cash-only, BYOB restaurant in the Texas Hill Country, it's a darned sight better than having no barbecue at all (plus the line may be just a smidge shorter). Interstate Bar-B-Que, Memphis International Airport . Where Salt Lick stands strong for Texas-style brisket and sausage, Jim Neely's joint makes the case for slow-smoked, sauce-smothered pork ribs, served up Memphis-style. Follow your nose, grab a heap of napkins, and build in a little extra time if you're planning to eat in (service can be as sloooowww as the cooking process). And don't skip the BBQ spaghetti. It's an only-in-Memphis treat that you owe yourself to try at least once. Tootsies Orchid Lounge, Nashville International Airport . Waylon Jennings, Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson and scores of other country legends got their start strumming and singing for customers at Tootsies Orchid Lounge. While the airport locale is miles away from the mini-chain's flagship behind Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, the same caliber of live performers grace the stage while travelers munch on their burgers (the food isn't anything to write home about). As with most of the town's honky tonks, there is no cover charge, but it's awfully good manners to toss a few bucks in the tip jar, especially if they take a request. Dooky Chase's Restaurant, Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport . Chef Leah Chase is often referred to as the \"Queen of Creole Cooking,\" and for good reason. Her versions of Louisiana classics like shrimp etouffee, red beans 'n' rice and catfish are considered definitive, and the airport renditions stand faithfully. While you owe it to yourself to visit the original Treme location, where you can take in Chase's astonishing collection of African-American art, her bowl of gumbo at the airport will let you know where yat. Obrycki's Restaurant and Bar, Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport . It's Bawlmer, hon! You gotta try a crabcake. Marylanders love few things more than debating the merits of various restaurants' renditions of their city's signature blend of lump crab meat, mayo, egg, seasonings (usually Old Bay) and just enough crumbs (either bread or saltines) to keep the whole mess together. Though the original Obrycki's, which had been slinging up crabby delights in Baltimore's Fell's Point since 1944, has closed, the BWI locale sticks pretty close to the formula that made the restaurant a Charm City classic. (You can also grab Obrycki's at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.) Gold Star Chili, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport . Where else in the world can you tell your significant other that you're just going to duck out for a three-way and have them ask if you can bring them back some extra crackers? Cincinnati natives will squabble 'til they're blue in the face over which chili parlor reigns supreme: Gold Star, Skyline, Empress or Dixie, but they'll all agree that this soupy, Greek-style chili is the single finest spaghetti topping, alongside handfuls of fluffy, shredded cheddar (three way), onions or beans (add one for a four-way) or all of the above (five way). Sop up any spare sauce with oyster crackers, or add a cheese coney (chili and cheese on a hot dog) for a perfect Queen City experience. Cowgirl Creamery/Acme Bread counter, San Francisco International Airport . If it's this seasonal and artisanal, it must be San Francisco. These two local legends team up to serve sandwiches that are not just excellent for airport eating, but worth wrapping up an extra to take take home. The cheese maker and baker take great care to source their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors, making this collaboration a perfect bite of the Bay Area. Tia Juanita's, Albuquerque International Sunport . Red or green? That's the state question, and it's ably answered by the New Mexico specialties served up at this airport food court counter. The question refers, of course, to the color of chiles -- served atop enchiladas, burritos (both standard and breakfast) and other regional delights. \"Christmas\" -- red and green together -- is also an acceptable answer, and the carne adovada (long-cooked, heavily-spiced pork) is a must for expats traveling through to less chile-centric destinations. National Coney Island Bar and Grill/Express, Detroit Metropolitan Airport . The Motor City takes its hot dogs as seriously as it takes its hot rods, and a Coney Island experience is a must. While the style isn't exclusive to this chain (there are more than 100 Coney Islands by name in the Detroit area), National Coney Island serves up a solid version of the grilled, natural-casing dog, nestled in a steamed bun, topped with all-meat beanless chili and chopped, sweet onions and a stripe or two of yellow mustard. It's a bit messy to eat on the run, so grab it and race on down to your gate to enjoy, or opt for one of the sit-down locations.\n\nSummary: Enjoy the famous seafood gumbo at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Savor the authentic Texas brisket at New Orleans Louis Armstrong International Airport. Indulge in Memphis-style vegetarian BBQ delights right at the airport.",

UPDATED: . 03:21 EST, 25 September 2013 . When it came to chucking-out time at Downing Street parties, it was my job to make sure all the guests actually left. No matter how many glasses they\u2019d had, you didn\u2019t want people walking past desks with confidential papers and taking a peek. On occasion, though, I had the opposite role, standing at the exit holding back furious journalists and civil servants trying to make last orders at the Red Lion on the grounds that Newsnight was still broadcasting live outside and half of them couldn\u2019t stand up. Champagne time: A social gathering on the Commons Terrace; but for others it can spiral out of control . Alcohol is integral to the culture of Westminster and Whitehall, McBride claims . Westminster is the binge-drinking . capital of Britain. Compared with now, I look back at the way I lived . then with disbelief. At the time, though, I couldn\u2019t believe my luck. By . the age of 25, when I was working as a civil servant for Customs before . being taken on by Gordon, I was already \u2014 by any measure \u2014 an . alcoholic. I used to walk past Smithfield Market in London at 7\u2009am and . often conclude that it made perfect sense for me to do my paperwork in . one of the 24-hour bars rather than at my desk. When I landed a job at the Treasury, life became more complicated. I had to be on call for ministers at any time, and the day was usually so busy with meetings that I couldn\u2019t just slope off to the pub. So my daily routine became a quick two pints while going out \u2018to get a sandwich\u2019 at lunchtime, two hours in the pub with colleagues straight after work, then back to the Treasury with a six-pack to do another three hours\u2019 work. I\u2019d have a can on the Tube and another four at home, before falling asleep on the sofa. Occasionally, I\u2019d arrive at the Treasury knowing I\u2019d done three hours\u2019 work the previous night \u2014 but not remembering what it was. As time went on, my choice of alcohol was largely unchanged \u2014 lager and white wine, usually at the same time \u2014 but my levels of consumption grew ever worse. It certainly didn\u2019t help that my role as Gordon\u2019s spin doctor only really required me to be at the end of a phone both to him and the media. Or that I was practically encouraged to take journalists for boozy lunches, long afternoons in the pub and late-night karaoke sessions. The occasions when I couldn\u2019t remember the previous night\u2019s events became more frequent and more worrying. Once, I tried to obtain entry to the Treasury at 2\u2009am and had a rambling row with the custodian \u2014 only for his supervisor to come down and tell me I was outside the Foreign Office. In September 2003, on one of my first overseas trips as the Treasury\u2019s head of communications, we all gathered at the end of the day in the recreation room at the British embassy in Dubai to watch Arsenal v Manchester United. I sat down with 15 cans of beer and started drinking at a ridiculous pace. When Ruud Van Nistelrooy missed a penalty, I jumped up and yelled at the screen: \u2018Have that, you ****** ********! You cheating ******!\u2019\u00a0 It was only then that I realised quite how many children were in the room, as well as the ambassador and his family. There was one man who always resisted alcohol, one politician who exemplified dipso-discipline \u00bf and that was Gordon Brown, his former spin doctor says . Gordon looked horrified, Ed Balls rather amused. And yet I can barely remember anyone in my entire time in the civil service or politics taking me to one side and telling me to take it easy. That\u2019s partly because alcohol is so integral to the culture of Westminster and Whitehall, that while I was seen as a big drinker, I wasn\u2019t totally beyond the norm. When Freddie Flintoff famously peed in the flowerbeds at a No. 10 reception for the 2005 Ashes victors, the reaction of many hardened Westminster drinkers was: \u2018Sounds a bit tame.\u2019 Indeed, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that I\u2019d still be an alcoholic if I\u2019d remained in my job. Who could avoid the summer and Christmas parties when politicians and government departments always bought far more booze than was necessary? Booze that, naturally, everyone felt they had to finish off. But there was one man who always resisted, one politician who exemplified dipso-discipline \u2014 and that was Gordon. He was quite capable of nursing the same glass of wine for two hours at a Downing Street reception. Despite this, he showed tremendous tolerance when I missed morning meetings or flights to Brussels, and fell over or dropped glasses at receptions. Once, in front of half the Treasury staff, I\u2019d had a one-sided physical altercation with a civil servant during a quiz night, and Gordon was told to speak to me about it. Power Trip, the book by former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride, reveals all in his new book . Bashfully, he addressed me about controlling my temper \u2014 but mentioned nothing about the fact I was drunk. On the odd occasion when he came into my office late at night, he\u2019d even manage to ignore the eight empty cans of lager on the desk. But that was because no matter how far gone I might be, I retained the ability to talk to him coherently and authoritatively about what was in tomorrow\u2019s papers and what our line should be. Except once, in 2006. I\u2019d just returned from a friend\u2019s stag do in Riga, which had ended with a Sunday football match at Old Trafford \u2014 so I\u2019d been drinking for 36 hours. Gordon called at the end of the game and asked me what was going to be in the papers. I barely knew what day it was. Staggering through a beer garden, I rambled incoherently and then shouted: \u2018It\u2019s words. It\u2019s words. Just words. Written in ink. It\u2019s just ink, Gordon.\u2019 My friends from the stag do were sitting on the wall of the pub, killing themselves laughing. \u2018Mm-hmm, I see,\u2019 said Gordon. Then he added gently: \u2018And, erm, what will be in the Telegraph?\u2019 He kept up the conversation for ten minutes, working his way through every paper and letting me dig myself ever deeper into the hole. Finally, he said: \u2018Well, thank you, Damian. Get back to your .\u2009.\u2009. ah .\u2009.\u2009. celebrations.\u2019 Gordon wasn\u2019t averse to some reflected glory when it suited him. In 2009, the celebrities who\u2019d climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief were invited to a No\u200910 reception with local schoolchildren and, while there was a great cast list due to attend, the real star was Cheryl Cole. Cheryl and Girls Aloud bandmate Kimberley Walsh were very late to the event, meaning Gordon Brown - and a very annoyed Gary Barlow - had to wait . There was an art to timing Gordon\u2019s . arrival at these things. We\u2019d keep all the celebrities who arrived early . in a holding room and tell them they\u2019d be going into the main reception . just as soon as Gordon had finished his phone call with the Israeli . Prime Minister \u2014 always our default excuse when we wanted to say he was . busy. What we\u2019d really . be doing was waiting for\u00a0 the biggest star to arrive, so he could walk . into\u00a0 the reception alongside them for the\u00a0 benefit of the cameras, not . to mention the\u00a0 screaming children. But obviously, you couldn\u2019t say to the . other celebrities: \u2018Sorry, guys, just waiting for the A-lister to arrive . and then we can go in,\u2019 or they might be a tad put out. On . this occasion, Cheryl and Girls Aloud bandmate Kimberley Walsh were . very late, Gordon was waiting to be summoned from his flat, and the . various other stars in the holding room were beginning to get a bit . peeved at waiting. Especially Gary Barlow. Eventually, the back gates of Downing Street swung open, a swanky car pulled in and one of the guards gave a thumbs-up. We got Gordon down straight away and he marched into the holding room, apologising profusely to the other celebrities for the wait and just giving time for Cheryl magically to arrive right on cue behind him. Except she didn\u2019t. There was still no Cheryl. \u2018Can we just hold on, everyone,\u2019 I said. \u2018We just need to warn the kids upstairs that you\u2019re coming up.\u2019 We didn\u2019t really. They were getting almost as bored of waiting as the celebrities, but we needed some excuse for the extra delay. Colleagues went running all round the building looking for where Cheryl and Kimberley had got to, and one eventually rushed up and whispered that they were on their way. One of our most star-struck special advisers had intercepted them at the back door and taken them for a quick look round the Cabinet room. I mentally started revving up my chainsaw, but said calmly: \u2018Oh Gordon, apparently two other guests have just arrived \u2014 so let\u2019s just hold on for them.\u2019 The eventual moment of Gordon walking in with Cheryl to the screams of the kids was great \u2014 apart, that is, from Gary Barlow scowling in the background. It came as little surprise to me when he came out for the Tories at the 2010 election. \u00a9 2013 Damian McBride.

A pro-Isis Twitter account said of the gun-toting PR representative: \u2018This brother Abu Moussa was martyred during missile clashes at the Taqba airbase.\u2019 His death has not yet been officially confirmed. Scroll down for video . Reportedly dead: Isis spokesman Abu Mosa has been killed in an airstrike, according to a Twitter account that's sympathetic to the terrorists . Mosa recently granted a journalist access to Isis fighters and even took him to the frontline in Syria, where he astonishingly broke off an interview to take pot shots at government soldiers. In a video for Vice News, he said: \u2018I say to America that the Islamic Caliphate has been established and we will not stop. Don\u2019t be cowards and attack us with drones. \u2018Instead send your soldiers, the ones we humiliated in Iraq. We will humiliate them everywhere, God willing. And we will raise the flag of Allah in the White House.\u2019 Mosa recently granted a journalist access to Isis fighters and even took him to the frontline in Syria . The news follows the revelation that at least one in four of the estimated 2,000 foreigners fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq is British - and half of those are already back in the UK. Serious questions have been raised as to whether enough is being done to stem the flow of fighters after the Government revealed it has only seized 23 passports this year to prevent them travelling to the war zone. The Government says there are around 500 British among the fighters while a further 250 are thought to have already returned to the UK where the police and security services are attempting to watch them. That means there are now almost three times as many British Muslims fighting for Islamic State than there are serving in the UK military, an MP has claimed. Islamic State released a video purportedly of Iraq's minority Yazidis taking part in a conversion ritual at an unknown location . But Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, told Channel 4 News the lack of border controls meant the Government\u2019s estimates of jihadi numbers were too low. \u2018I think it\u2019s about 2,000 people,\u2019 he added. According to the Ministry of Defence, there are around 600 British Muslims currently serving in the Armed Forces - just 0.4 per cent of total personnel. This is far below the 4.3 per cent of the British population as a whole who are Muslim. Irish police also believe that 30 jihadists are using the country as a base while travelling to and from Syria and Iraq. The murder of James Foley apparently by 'John' - one of a gang of British jihadis known as 'The Beatles' - has raised fears the killing fields of Syria and Iraq are dominated by extremist Britons. Peshmerga fighters stand on a vehicle with a Kurdish flag as they guard Mosul Dam in northern Iraq, which was in the hands of ISIS .\n\nSummary: Abu Mosa, the ISIS spokesman who threatened to raise their flag in the White House, has been confirmed dead after a U.S. drone strike at the Taqba airbase.",

Four years after a trainer was drowned and dismembered by a killer whale at SeaWorld, employees are being made to wear safety vests. But critics believe the jackets still wouldn't save lives in a confrontation with one of the ocean predators. SeaWorld trainers started wearing the new inflatable safety vests on Monday, which marine park officials say took three years to develop. The slim jackets are inflatable and even include a small oxygen tank which can buy a trainer a few minutes of breathing if dragged underwater. The jackets are just one of many new safety measures instituted by the park after the February 24, 2020 death of trainer Dawn Brancheau. Scroll down for video . life saver: Starting Monday, SeaWorld is requiring orca trainers to wear new custom-designed safety vests while interacting with whales at their shows . Response: The new safety vests become inflatable and also have a small oxygen tank allowing for a few minutes of breathing underwater . Brancheau was performing with a killer . whale named Tilikum at the Shamu Stadium in Orlando when the orca . pulled her off the platform and into the pool - refusing to release her. Since . Brancheau's death, trainers have been unable to get into the water with . the killer whales amid calls for new safety measures. Kelly . Flaherty Clark, SeaWorld's curator of animal training, refused to . speculate on whether the new vests would have saved Brancheau's life, . but David Kirby, author of 'Death at SeaWorld', offered up his negative . opinion. He told WKMG that the vest 'would not have saved any of the trainers who . were killed by orcas. Dawn was rammed and dismember by Tilikum, A vest . and spare air would have been useless.' He . also points out that the vests are dangerous as well, and could give . trainers the bends if they were using the oxygen tank and suddenly . pushed to the surface by one of the whales. Tragedy: The new safety measures come four years after the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was dismembered after being dragged underwater by a killer whale named Tilikum . Other safety changes include remotely controlled pool gates, new walkways around Shamu Stadium and an additional raised platform in an orca pool that could be used to lift a whale out of the water should a trainer fall in. But the vests are probably the most visible change that park visitors will notice, she said. The start of using the vests had nothing to do with an appellate court's recent decision upholding a ruling that Sea World had violated a federal workplace safety law, Flaherty Clark added. Earlier this month, that appellate court in Washington upheld a regulatory safety finding against Sea World by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission following an investigation into Brancheau's drowning. The court said Sea World had exposed trainers to recognized hazards when working in close contact with killer whales during performances. Currently, trainers are not allowed in the water with the orcas, and must remain 18 inches away from the whales while standing and three feet while kneeling. Faherty-Clark says the new jackets aren't a part of a ploy to get trainers back into the pool for shows. 'Right now, that's not something we're even considering. This is just a piece of equipment to maybe make that environment a little bit safer,' Faherty-Clark told WESH. The dark side of SeaWorld: After Brancheau's death, Tilikum became the subject of an HBO documentary about deaths at the park. The film argues that killer whales in captivity become more aggressive to humans and each other . Known danger: The whale Tilikum had been involved in two other deaths when trainer Dawn Brancheau was dragged underwater by him during a show . Tilikum subsequently became the focus of the 2013 documentary film 'Blackfish,' which explores what may have caused Tilikum to kill Brancheau. The documentary argues that killer whales, when in captivity, become more aggressive to humans and each other.  Since the documentary, several entertainers have pulled out of planned performances at SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. parks. 'The two things happened in completely different silos,' Flaherty Clark said of the ruling and the use of the vests. 'The team was close to complete before the ruling.'\n\nSummary: SeaWorld has introduced new safety vests for trainers to wear during performances with dolphins, following the tragic incident four years ago when a trainer was fatally injured by a dolphin named Tilikum. The vests are equipped with flotation capabilities and a small oxygen supply. Despite the new measures, trainers will continue to perform in-water stunts with the marine mammals, maintaining close contact as part of the show.",

She had been up for more than 11 hours while the jury deliberated, anxiously awaiting word. She remained hopeful but deeply afraid. She couldn't eat. When the verdict was announced at about midnight in Perugia, Italy, her worst fears came true. Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of murdering Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito 25 years in prison. Following the verdict, people flooded out of the Italian courtroom. When the prosecution emerged, a rush of applause followed. \"To see the people outside the courtroom applauding -- that just made me sick, that people can be that callous and cold,\" Huff said. Soon after the verdict, Knox's parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, emerged and swiftly moved through the crowd. Watch Janet Huff's interview with CNN's Campbell Brown . Huff said she spoke to Knox's parents shortly after the verdict. \"They are, of course, shattered. They are not doing great,\" Huff said. \"But we have already started the process of appeals. That's all we can do.\" For Huff, Knox is still the strong, kindhearted girl she has always known -- not the cold-blooded killer prosecutors portrayed during the trial. Huff said Knox was worried about the trial's impact on the family. \"I think that's what gets her through, knowing that she's got to be strong,\" she said. \"If she falls apart, then we are really going to lose it. Knox's parents: Our daughter is no killer . \"I know she is terribly disappointed, heartbroken and scared to death, but she's more concerned about her family and how we are.\" With Knox's conviction, Huff said the family was moving forward with plans for some relatives to move to Italy to be near Knox. The cost and physical toll of constantly traveling to Italy was weighing on the family, she said. \"We've looked at jobs and apartments just in case this happened,\" she said. \"There's no way we are going to leave Amanda in Italy all alone.\" Knox's case has attracted widespread media attention and prompted salacious articles focusing on her sex life. Her name and photo have appeared on the front pages of newspapers all over the world, and now, Huff fears, things may get worse. \"Now that there's a guilty verdict, she's always going to be remembered as 'The convicted killer Amanda Knox,' and I'm disgusted by that,\" Huff said. Maria Cantwell, a U.S. senator from Knox's home state of Washington, issued a statement saying she was \"saddened by the verdict.\" \"I have serious questions about the Italian justice system and whether anti-Americanism tainted this trial,\" Cantwell said. \"I will be conveying my concerns to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\" Huff said she hopes the appeals process will show what her family has believed all along. \"She will be vindicated and she will be found innocent,\" she said. Despite the pain the trial has brought Knox's family, Huff stressed it is nothing compared to what victim Meredith Kercher's family has gone through. \"They still don't have closure, they may think they are vindicated with the guilty verdict but we know it doesn't bring their daughter back,\" she said.\n\nSummary: Janet Huff: \"It was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it\"\nAmanda Knox, former boyfriend, convicted of murdering British student Meredith Kercher.\nAunt says seeing people applaud verdict outside court made her sick.\nHuff says Knox's parents are \"shattered, they are not doing great\"",

Many city dwellers have resigned themselves to the fact that living in close proximity to pet owners means sharing the sidewalks with their four-legged friends. But in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, authorities are thinking about banning dogs altogether. The radical measure, if passed, could ban any canines from walking along a key 10-block stretch of Beaver Falls\u2019 downtown business district. No dogs go downtown? Officials in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania are toying with the idea of banning dogs from a 10-block stretch of the downtown strip . The Beaver County Times reported that officials in Beaver Falls believe part of the problem is that larger dogs, including pit bulls and Rottweilers, sometimes left tied to parking meters by their owners. City Manager says some of the dogs are \u2018as big as ponies.\u2019 Another concern is simply that some owners don't clean up after their dogs. One elderly resident nearly tripped over a leashed dog as he tried to make his way down the sidewalk, said City Manager Steve Johnson. The city is still researching a possible ban and council doesn't expect to act on it until later in the year. While some residents applaud the move, others say the city should focus on drug crimes and prostitution in the city about 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. Revitalizing: Officials say that large dogs that are curbed downtown just congest the sidewalks . Checkered past: The downtown strip is battling image problems due to drug deals and prostitution . Many businesses along the stretch of downtown have complained that dogs along the strip are unsanitary, and prevent potential customers from strolling along the storefronts. But the paper notes that even if dogs were banned, the downtown section has a checkered past with drugs and prostitution. Resident Gary Davis told the Times that the whole endeavour is a \u2018waste of time,\u2019 adding that having officers patrolling the streets would be much more effective. As it stands, the city is still looking into the parameters on a possible ban, and won\u2019t vote on any until later this fall.\n\nSummary: City officials in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania eying possibility of banning dogs on downtown strip.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- As a young freedom fighter, Nelson Mandela stepped out of a farmhouse hideout in South Africa, took 20 strides and dug a hole on the sprawling land. He leaned over, put in a semiautomatic pistol and 200 rounds of ammunition, and carefully put a khaki uniform over them. After covering them with heaps of soil, he sauntered back into his rural hideout in northern Johannesburg -- hoping to retrieve them soon. He never got a chance to fire a shot with the Makarov pistol. A few weeks after he buried it at the farm in Rivonia, he was hurled into prison for the next 27 years. That was in 1962, and the whereabouts of the gun -- now estimated at $3 million -- remain a mystery, said Nicholas Wolpe, the chief executive of Liliesleaf Farm, the former hideout now converted into a museum. A scramble to find the gun has sparked a frenzy among collectors, historians and Mandela fans. 'It's interesting how we came to find out about the gun,\" Wolpe said. \"Mandela visited Liliesleaf in 2003, and as we were walking around, he turned to me and asked, 'By the way, did you find my gun?\" Wolpe said he was stunned. \"I turned to him and said, 'Gun, what gun?' \" Mandela then asked him to pinpoint where the main kitchen once stood. \"He then made a 45-degree angle and said, '20 paces from here, I buried a gun,' \" Wolpe said. During the visit, the two tried to retrace his steps using the paces as a guide, but the farm had undergone some changes, making it hard to determine the original location of the kitchen with certainty. Wolpe later realized that the former South African president had talked about the gun during an interview with a journalist in the 1990s right after he was freed from prison. During the interview, Mandela indicated that he buried the pistol, ammunition and the uniform at the site in case there was a raid at the house, according to Wolpe. Mandela and the military wing of the African National Congress used the secret location -- now Liliesleaf Farm -- to plan the toppling of the South African apartheid government. It is the first gun Mandela owned and the first weapon linked to the anti-apartheid fight in South Africa, Wolpe said. The gun was a gift by Ethiopian Col. General Biru Tadesse, whom Mandela visited in the early 1960s for military advice on fighting apartheid. Despite its hefty price tag, Wolpe hastily makes it clear that it's not about the money or glorifying violence. \"It is all about the historical significance of the gun and who it belongs to,\" Wolpe said. \"The 1960s were a defining moment in South Africa's struggle ... The gun has a special link to a very significant period and epoch to our liberation struggle.\" A scramble to find the gun has prompted Wolpe to take extreme measures. He hired searchers to demolish a home on Liliesleaf's property, carefully ripping up chunks of concrete and turning over a yard to find it. He also dispatched military experts to try and pinpoint its exact location based on Mandela's information. His trust owns about five acres of the original 20-acre hideout. \"The expert identified three possible locations, two of which are on our site,\" Wolpe said. The third location is on neighboring property, which was put up for auction last week. Historians, collectors and potential international bidders were among the 400 people who participated. Despite the frenzy surrounding the potential site of the gun, the property worth about $350,000 did not sell. \"I'm still shocked, I don't understand why it did not sell,\" said lead auctioneer Joff van Reenen, who speculated that potential buyers may have been scared off by the publicity surrounding the gun. Unlike Wolpe, the owner of the neighboring property did not make an effort to find the gun. The property includes a modern Spanish-style house, under which the military expert believes is the potential third location of the gun. And the mystery continues as both Wolpe and the owner of the neighboring home hope the gun is on their land. \"Obviously, it would be totally inappropriate to ask him for help now,\" Wolpe said of the ailing 92-year-old Mandela. \"And there is no new information he can give us that would make finding it easier.\"\n\nSummary: He buries the gun before he is thrown into prison in 1962.

A Sikh gang was today convicted of slashing a retired Indian general\u2019s throat in a revenge attack for a military operation nearly 30 years ago which left at least 500 dead. Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, 78, was attacked as he walked with his wife Meena, in Old Quebec Street, central London, on September 30 last year. Lt Gen Brar was involved in a controversial military operation - Operation Blue Star - against Sikh militants in Amritsar, north west India, in June 1984. Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar, who was involved in Operation Blue Star in 1984, was attacked as he walked with his wife in London last year . Dilbag Singh (left), from London, and Mandeep Singh Sandhu (right), from Birmingham, have been convicted of wounding with intent . The operation left at least 500 people dead and turned Lt Gen Brar into the target of revenge attacks. Mandeep Singh Sandhu, 34, of Birmingham, and Londoners Dilbag Singh, 37, and Harjit Kaur, 39, were all convicted of wounding with intent. The jury of nine women and two men took just an hour to convict them. Southwark Crown Court heard that Barjinder Singh Sangha, 33, of Wolverhampton, has already admitted the charge. The victim\u2019s role in the Indian Army, overseeing 'a number of military operations... made him a target for Sikh extremist groups', the trial heard. The crown argued the defendants launched 'a highly premeditated assault'. Harjit Kaur (left), from London, has also been convicted of wounding with intent. Barjinder Singh Sangha, from Wolverhampton, had already admitted the charge . The trial heard how the victim's role in the Indian Army 'made him a target for Sikh extremist groups' Kaur was described as being key to the ambush. She boarded the same bus as the old soldier and his wife of 28 years to track their movements and phone through reports to the alleged attackers who were waiting. The couple were on their way from their hotel for a night in the West End when the attack happened. They visited London annually for about 15 years. The crown said Sangha 'drew a knife as the other men held the victim'. Sikhs protest after the storming of the Golden Temple at Amritsar . The Indian army attack took place at the Golden Temple of Amritsar, India . The ex-soldier, who was left with a cut running across his jaw and neck and another to the jaw, has survived several assassination attempts . The ex-soldier was left with a 12-inch cut running across his jaw and neck and another three inch cut to the jaw. Operation Bluestar was an Indian military operation against Sikh separatists in Amritsar's Golden Temple. Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi ordered the attack in June 1984 after Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, leader of the Damdami Taksal - a Sikh religious group - and political revolutionary, had been accused of amassing weapons at the Sikh temple and starting an armed uprising, a notion which has been rejected by Sikh scholars. The attack was carried out by army troops with tanks, artillery, helicopters and armoured vehicles. Tensions increased following the attacks as Sikhs across the globe reacted with anger. The increased tensions led to attacks on Sikhs in India. Later that year, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her own Sikh bodyguards, triggering a further wave of retaliation that left nearly 3,000 Sikhs dead. The victim has survived several assassination attempts and still receives death threats. Lt Gen Brar, speaking via a videolink from India, said as a result of the attack his protection ranking was raised to the highest possible in India. The defendants showed no reaction when they were convicted. The trio along with Singh Sangha will be sentenced on September 19 after pre-sentencing reports are produced. Mari Reid, of the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s Counter Terrorism Division, said: 'This was a violent and life-threatening attack carried out by Sikh extremists on the streets of London\u2019s West End. 'Lieutenant General Brar sustained deep cuts to his face and neck in full view of his wife near their hotel on Old Quebec Street. 'Lieutenant General Brar was targeted in a highly planned and premeditated attack. Harjit Kaur was instrumental in carrying out reconnaissance of the area and followed the Brars around London. 'The couple were set upon in what was a swift, effective and terrifying ambush; Sandhu and Singh held Lieutenant General Brar down as Sangha slashed at his neck with a knife. 'The group clearly targeted Lieutenant General Brar in revenge for his actions during his military career and today\u2019s convictions are another reminder that the UK will not tolerate extremism of any kind.'\n\nSummary: Lieutenant General Kuldip Singh Brar was attacked in London last year.\nHe was involved in Operation Blue Star against Sikh militants in 1984.\nOperation in Amritsar, north west India, left at least 500 people dead.\nTwo men and a woman have now been found guilty of wounding with intent.\nA third man had already admitted the charge.",

Commuters on Tuesday morning were greeted with a pair of billowing white banners atop the Brooklyn Bridge after vandals stole Old Glory and replaced them with ones that had been bleached. The flags appeared to have faint traces of stars and stripes on it. It was revealed this afternoon that the flags were defaced by vandals who bleached\u00a0 them. The vandals tacked aluminum covers on to the lights that illuminated that flags, so that the top of the bridge towers looked dark. As a result, the white flags were not discovered until daybreak. EarthCam video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am. The second tower went dark seven minutes later, indicating the heist was at least a two-person job. Scroll down for video . Whitewash: This photo shows that the flags above the Brooklyn Bridge appear to have been bleached American Flags - the stars and stripes are faintly visible . Surrender? A vandal replaced the American flags atop the Brooklyn Bridge with white banners on Tuesday - the international symbol for surrender . No one knows why or how the flags were hoisted above the Brooklyn Bridge. Officials called it a major security breach . So far, the NYPD has no clue who is . behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they . don't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics. 'This . may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at a . statement,' John Miller, Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence of the . NYPD, said this afternoon. Several officers scaled the bridge and were seen lowering the flag on the Manhattan side around 11am as traffic inched along the bridge. The bridge is one of the most heavily secured landmarks in the city, constantly monitored by surveillance cameras. Police patrol cars are also stationed at both ends of the bridge. Detectives are reviewing security footage in an attempt to determine who put up the white flags - and how they gained access to the span. The support towers are 273-feet tall and it's unknown how the thieves managed to climb them without anyone noticing.

A crushing 3-2 home defeat to Swansea on Tuesday left the plucky club from the north west staring at relegation to England's second tier after eight years of defying the odds. Roberto Martinez's side, famous for miraculous escapes in previous years, now find themselves three points adrift of safety with just two games remaining. It means their clash with Manchester City in England's premier domestic cup competition at Wembley on Saturday could be their last slice of the limelight for some time. Conversely, City warmed up for the showpiece final with a 1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion, that edged them towards a second place finish behind champions Manchester United. Wigan had taken the lead over Swansea, nestled safely in mid table, thanks to a volley from Roger Espinoza but shortly after halftime Angel Rangel equalized with an equally smart volley. James McCarthy restored Wigan's lead finishing off a fine move but then Wigan shot themselves in the foot with some sloppy defending which has blighted their season. First a poor pass from Gary Caldwell allowed Itey Shechter to level things at 2-2 before a mix up in the six-yard box allowed Dwight Tiendalli to scramble home the winning goal. With a trip to Arsenal and a home clash with Aston Villa left, Wigan now have a mountain to climb, but Martinez tried to remain positive. \"Today the number of injuries we have had at the back shows and there are key moments that affected us,\" Martinez told Sky Sports. \"We conceded sloppy goals with bad decisions and that's very unfortunate because you could see the effort of the players and the desire to want to win the game. \"Emotionally today was such a difficult game for us and when you concede such goals in a soft manner then it is hard to recover. \"It's a missed opportunity. We've got incredible character and we're determined to fight for every single point there is left.\" City rested several players ahead of the cup final and their winner came from Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko. It moved them seven points clear of third placed Chelsea. Roberto Mancini told reporters: \"It was a difficult game because we changed a lot of players but it was important for us to win the game. \"After 10 minutes we started to play better and we missed five incredible chances to score which made it difficult for us in the second half.\" In Italy, Roma missed the chance to draw level on points with fifth-placed Fiorentina in Serie A after they lost to Chievo Verona. Cyril Thereau scored the only goal of the game in the final minute of the match to move Chievo Verona into 12th position.\n\nSummary: FA Cup finalists Manchester City and Wigan suffer mixed fortunes in Premier League. City beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 but Wigan lose crucial match with Swansea. Wigan's hopes of avoiding relegation now look slim ahead of Saturday's FA Cup final. Chievo Verona score a 90th minute winner against AS Roma in Serie A.",

Doctors told her family she needed a major operation to save her mobility and she feared the spinal fusion surgery would shatter her dreams of riding horses again. Joanna Davis was diagnosed with scoliosis two years ago and was warned by doctors she might need surgery to correct the curvature in her spine - the operation would involve placing metal rods on either side of her spine . But after researching scoliosis on the internet the teenager discovered an alternative form of treatment being administered at a clinic in London in which patients undergo four weeks of intensive therapy. She took a course in which she was taught stretching exercises to strengthen the muscles surrounding her spine and to bring her spine into a more upright position. Now Joanna, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, is riding again and is hoping to go to university to train as a vet. She said: \u2018I feel like I have been re-born, it\u2019s incredible the results I have. My back looks amazing and I have my energy back. \u2018My confidence has soared and I am so excited about getting back to riding and really focusing on getting to university in two years\u2019 time. I know I am young but I know what I want and I know that I will just need to go out and get it. \u2018I am still very determined to continue riding even though I know it will be harder when I am living away from home. I have made some amazing friends and their support has been invaluable. In a bid to avoid surgery, Joanna attended an exercise course at the Scoliosis SOS Rehabilitation Centre (file picture). This taught her exercises to strengthen the muscles in her back and core . \u2018I am ecstatic that I have been able to avoid surgery, having surgery would have stopped me from being who I want to be and would have damaged my ability to ride, these exercises are easy and I have just adapted them so that they fit in with everyday life. \u2018I want to work with horses and train as a vet and these exercises have given me options again. I was getting so down about everything and how I was going to do what I wanted with my life and now it feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.\u2019 Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape. Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not hanging properly and back pain. In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000. It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis. It is more common in women than in men. Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows. However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing. Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine. In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain. Source: NHS Choices . Joanna\u2019s problems began when her family started to notice that her shoulder blade was protruding on one side. She had also started getting tired far quicker than normal and was complaining of aches and pains in her back. Riding teachers had noticed her lack of energy and saw her posture on horseback was getting worse and that she was struggling to sit up straight when she was riding. Joanna was sent to see her GP who diagnosed scoliosis and she was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon who said her curve was one of the worst he had seen and her only option was a ten hour operation to fuse her spine from top to bottom. Joanna was worried that she would have to give up her hobbies because of her spinal deformity, lost a great deal of flexibility and her confidence deteriorated fast. The teenager added: \u2018Scoliosis destroyed my world. I have always been so passionate about riding, getting up on a horse and giving absolutely everything to be out in the fields. \u2018But when I started feeling tired and getting pain down my back, it was really hard to stay motivated. I struggled to keep up with all my lessons and I lost loads of confidence. \u2018Everyone around me was really worried and it was hard because I felt like I was letting everyone down and being a hassle.\u2019 Later Joanna and her family researched the treatment of scoliosis and feared for the teenager\u2019s future at it is a progressive condition and if left untreated can lead to fatal heart and lung problems. Current treatment for severe scoliosis usually involves surgery to insert metal rods either side of the spine, fusing it solid. However, the surgery is long and painful and comes with risks. Eventually, Joanna\u2019s family found an alternative treatment known as the ScolioGold Method which is administered by scoliosis suffer Erika Maude. The exercise programme Joanna undertook is run by Erika Maude (pictured), a former scoliosis sufferer . It has eased her symptoms meaning she is able to avoid surgery for now. The treatment reduces pain by getting the patient\u2019s muscles to work together to support the spine properly with the aim of preventing the curve progressing. Erika Maude, who opened the clinic seven years ago, said: \u2018Joanna has done extremely well and has dramatically reduced the asymmetries surrounding her shoulders and hips. \u2018She has reduced her pain and has de-rotated her rib cage to the point where she is now able to stand straighter and her muscles are able to support her spine properly. Since undertaking the exercise programme Joanna says her pain has reduced and her posture has improved. Image shows an X-ray of a person with severe scoliosis (file picture) \u2018Joanna will now be under close observation to ensure she maintains the results she has achieved and will continue to exercise on a daily basis.\u2019 A spokesperson for Scoliosis Association UK said: \u2018With respect to the treatment of scoliosis we always advise that patients follow the advice of a scoliosis specialist. \u2018The scientific evidence that intensive exercise \u201ccures\u201d scoliosis is sparse and unreliable. \u2018In mild curvatures intensive exercise can improve posture, muscle strength (thereby supporting the spine more efficiently), flexibility, and appearance, but there is no long-term evidence that it will ultimately prevent progression of a curve. \u2018It is important to remember that the scoliosis is different in individuals and that some may have only very mild curvatures that will not progress. \u2018Such individuals will therefore benefit from treatments that improve appearance \u2013 largely because of positive psychological benefits. \u2018Specialists undertake surgery only if it is essential for the long-term health of the individual, how much of the spine is fused will depend on the position and severity of the curve, and great care and consideration is taken to minimise the effect on spinal flexibility. \u2018The dangers of surgery are overstated. Serious complications are very rare indeed. \u2018Staying fit and active and keeping the core muscles strong is highly desirable for everyone, and especially so for people with spinal conditions, however, a life-long programme of specific exercise is a huge commitment, with no guarantee of long-term success.\u2019 For more information visit www.sauk.org.uk .\n\nSummary: Joanna Davis, 16, was diagnosed with scoliosis two years ago.\nShe was diagnosed after developing pain in her back, a lack of energy and after her riding instructors noticed she was struggling to sit up straight.\nDoctors warned her she might need lengthy surgery to place metal rods on either side of her spine to fuse it in place and hold it straight.\nAnxious to avoid this, she undertook an exercise programme known as the ScolioGold Method and has now been able to return to riding.\nExperts say this can help relieve the pain of condition for some time.",

With the next \"Hunger Games\" movie opening today amid a sea of buzz, fans of Suzanne Collins' trilogy are lining up to see Katniss and Peeta battle it out against other victors in the Quarter Quell, the 75th Hunger Games competition. But they may also come away wanting to take a trip to the Aloha State. Although much of the preliminary filming of \"Catching Fire\" took place on the U.S. mainland, the cast and crew spent five weeks in the dense jungles and pristine beaches of the North Shore of Oahu, enjoying the sun, sand and aloha of the 50th state. Now, travelers heading to Hawaii can retrace the stars' footprints along the jungles and beaches that played host to Panem's annual battle-to-the-death match in \"Catching Fire.\" North Shore Bay as saltwater lake . Though the North Shore of Oahu might be known for its massive swells, location scouts needed a beach with clear, calm water to act as the saltwater lake in the Quell arena. Honolulu Film Commissioner Walea Constantinau recommended Kawela Bay as the perfect location for a crucial scene when the tributes appear on top of the lake, ready for battle. Kawela Bay is stunning crescent of crystal blue popular with green sea turtles and paddle boarders, a hobby cast members took up in between takes. Access this secluded and sacred beach by walking 30 minutes from Turtle Bay Resort along the coast during low tide. Running through the jungles like Katniss and Peeta . You won't be racing from skin-eating fog or wild monkey-like creatures when exploring the lush North Shore, but you can get swallowed by greenery while hiking through one of Hawaii's most sacred valleys. Many of the film's jungle scenes were filmed in remote locations in the North Shore's Waimea Valley that are off-limits to tourists. However, you can still follow in the footsteps of Katniss and Peeta escaping the blistering fog or hearing jabberjays (likely mynah birds) in this natural wonderland. Those wanting to try racing through the jungles can access Waimea Valley, which is almost 40 miles from Waikiki, via the valley's visitor center east of Haleiwa. Take a short hike through the reconstructed ancient village to spot endangered birds, archeological sites, replicas of ancient sacred structures called heiaus and the 40-foot Waimea Falls, which you can swim under. North Carolina lures 'Hunger Games' fans . Closer to Waikiki, the Manoa Valley Trail system -- which portrayed another part of the movie's Arena jungle -- is a series of strenuous hikes that will test your Katniss-like endurance. The most popular path, the Manoa Falls Trail, skirts through bamboo and along streams and meets up with the 150-foot Manoa Falls. Real adventurers can take a series of trailheads through the dense forest of Manoa Valley and up behind Paradise Park, a former animal performance venue, where scenes from \"Catching Fire\" and the popular television show \"Lost\" were filmed. Luxe it up like the stars . Since much of the filming took place on the North Shore, many of the cast and crew stayed at Turtle Bay Resort, a location also featured in the film \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\" Perched atop the edge of Kuilima Cove, the resort offers access to a lovely beach perfect for snorkeling, horseback riding, kayaking and stand up paddle boarding lessons. Cast member and Hawaii resident Woody Harrelson was known to escape to nearby beaches on his breaks from filming to brave the infamous North Shore swells. Actress Jennifer Lawrence was spotted poolside on numerous occasions. They also filmed one day at the hotel's Bay View Beach, steps from the Ocean Villas, where many cast members and their families stayed and celebrated Thanksgiving last year. Cast and crew appreciated the onsite restaurant Ola's and Lei Lei's Bar & Grill. They also reportedly spent many nights at the resort's Surfer, The Bar, run in collaboration with Surfer magazine. This is the place to be on the North Shore, with great cocktails and live music nightly. Oahu resident Jack Johnson recently popped in to play an impromptu set. Hawaii's film legacy . Film buffs who want more than \"the Hunger Game\"s version of Hawaii can drive along the Windward Coast of Oahu to Halona Cove, a speck of beach beyond Halona Blowhole; this is where Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr had their famed beach kiss in \"From Here to Eternity.\" For an in-depth look at Oahu's cinematic history, consider the Kualoa Ranch movie tour. Just 22 miles north of Honolulu, this peaceful 4,000-acre preserve offers guided tours of the dozens of film and TV programs shot throughout the property, including the scene in the first \"Jurassic Park\" when the ostrich-like dinosaurs were escaping the T-Rex. Travelers wanting to revisit \"Lost,\" \"Hawaii Five-0\" and other Oahu film locations can book an off-road vehicle tour of the Windward Coast and Ka'a'awa Valley with Kos Tours. They are rumored to be developing a \"Hunger Games\" tour, so be sure to bring your bow and arrow, and \"may the odds forever be in your favor.\"\n\nSummary: Explore the Manoa Valley Trail, where the Hunger Games' desert scenes were filmed.\nSwim in the freshwater lake that served as the backdrop for the Quell Arena.\nStay at the exclusive resort in Oahu where the cast filmed pivotal city scenes.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- A red rope guarded by police marks the \"quarantine line\" around the West Point slum in the Liberian capital, Monrovia. Beyond it, more than 70,000 people are trapped -- angry, scared and increasingly hungry -- as authorities seek to halt the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. As soon as a CNN team crossed the line, it was swarmed by people desperate to be heard. Since the government designated the slum an Ebola quarantine zone last week, there has been no way out. Stuck without sanitation or running water, and with food supplies for many running low, people fear for their lives. The quarantine measures were imposed after rioters looted an Ebola treatment center in the slum, claiming the virus was a government hoax. A nurse at the center told CNN she arrived for her shift that night to find the center destroyed and not a patient to be found. The center is slowly being rebuilt, but it lacks basic equipment and facilities. Medical workers have to wash their protective gear for reuse and have little more than a squirt of bleach to rely on. 'I'm scared of everything' It is the only refuge for the slum's frightened residents. But the most that they can hope for is to be made comfortable while they wait either to overcome the virus -- or not. Like many residents of West Point, Charming Fallah, a hairdresser, has to travel out of the township to make a living. She is the only breadwinner for her two children and her elderly parents. \"Right now, my mother doesn't have anything,\" she told CNN. \"First, I was the one that provided for her. But as time goes by, she's complaining the rice is finished. I just came from my parents' house and she has nothing.\" Asked if she is more scared by the disease or by hunger, Fallah replied: \"Both. That's what's worrying us. The hunger, the Ebola, everything. I'm scared of everything.\" Her fears are far from unfounded. Experts have described the West African outbreak, centered in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, as the worst in the history of the virus. Doctors, nurses succumb . The World Health Organization said Monday that 120 health care workers have died in the Ebola outbreak, and twice that number have been infected. Public health experts say several factors are to blame, including a shortage of protective gear and improper use of the gear they do have. In a commentary released this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine, doctors from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, wrote that personal protective gear made to shield health care workers from Ebola-contaminated fluids isn't being used properly. The commentary says that even with the correct gear, a health care worker is at risk for infection if contaminated protective clothing is not removed correctly. The Ebola virus is transmitted through direct or indirect contact between bodily fluids from an infected patient; that's why taking off the protective gear correctly is essential. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University's School of Medicine, says following the proper sequence of removing protective gear can keep health care workers from infecting themselves. The sequence is simple. You start with the gloves, then take off the eye protection, gown and surgical mask. Follow up with washing your hands. Why is this particular sequence so important? \"Because if you leave your gloves on, and take off your eye protection first, you could pass the fluids from the gloves to your eye mucus,\" explains Schaffner. \"No matter where you are, no matter what day of the week it is, never change the sequence of how you take the equipment off.\" One or two doctors per 100,000 people . The fact that the disease has killed so many people working to care for infected patients is making it increasingly hard to combat the virus in West Africa, WHO said. \"It depletes one of the most vital assets during the control of any outbreak. WHO estimates that in the three hardest-hit countries, only one to two doctors are available to treat 100,000 people, and these doctors are heavily concentrated in urban areas.\" The threat can mean other health facilities close, as staff members choose to stay home rather than risk their lives. This means other medical needs, such as help with childbirth and malaria treatment, are neglected. \"The fact that so many medical staff have developed the disease increases the level of anxiety: if doctors and nurses are getting infected, what chance does the general public have?\" the group wrote. \"In some areas, hospitals are regarded as incubators of infection and are shunned by patients with any kind of ailment, again reducing access to general health care.\" The heavy toll is also making it harder to secure support from sufficient numbers of foreign medical staff, the group said. Last week, a WHO health care worker was infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone. The organization has temporarily pulled its health workers from the Kailahun post and has sent a team to review the incident. \"This was the responsible thing to do. The field team has been through a traumatic time through this incident,\" Dr. Daniel Kertesz, a WHO representative in Sierra Leone, said in a statement. \"They are exhausted from many weeks of heroic work, helping patients infected with Ebola. When you add a stressor like this, the risk of accidents increases.\" Blood and other bodily fluids . Ebola is one of the world's most virulent diseases and is transmitted through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of infected people. The outbreak has forced various nations to take drastic action, including Ivory Coast, which has said it is closing borders it shares with Guinea and Liberia for an indefinite period. Senegal also closed its borders over Ebola fears. The closure includes any aircraft and ships traveling to Senegal from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia. Amid fears of the disease's spread, the Philippines recalled 115 peacekeepers from Liberia. Dr. Peter Paul Galvez, a spokesman for the Philippines' Department of National Defense, said they would be repatriated as soon as possible. They will be quarantined before departure for 21 days, then quarantined again in the Philippines for another 21 days. Early symptoms of Ebola include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. These symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection. CNN's Kathy Quiano and Val Willingham contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: NEW: World Health Organization pulls workers from Kailahun post in Sierra Leone. The World Health Organization says 120 health care workers have died in the outbreak. Quarantine on West Point slum was imposed after rioters looted a treatment center.

The Austin school district has fired 33-year-old Alfredo Andrade-Gaytan. Andrade-Gaytan taught a bilingual kindergarten class at a central Austin elementary school. Alfredo Andrade-Gaytan: He has been arrested and charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child after a 6-year-old girl told her parents that Andrade-Gaytan had assaulted her . Unexpected: Andrade-Gaytan, a third-grade bilingual teacher, had been teaching a summer school program at Reilly Elementary. According to an arrest affidavit, Andrade-Gaytan kept a six-year-old girl in the classroom while the remainder of the class went to recess and asked her if she\u2019d like to play a game.. She was a student in Andrade-Gaytan\u2019s summer Kindergarten class at Reilly Elementary. Police tried to question Andrade-Gaytan on Thursday, but he denied being alone with the girl. The girl told a parent she had been assaulted. Investigators say she was taken to a hospital, and DNA evidence has been found on her clothing. On Friday, Andrade-Gaytan allegedly called AISD police to confess, saying he wanted to talk about 'making a mistake.' There is no evidence that other students had been or will be in any danger. Communication: A letter was sent home to parents explaining the situation. School officials said that nothing came up on Andrade-Gaytan\u00bfs criminal background checks when he was hired and subsequent checks were clean . Andrade-Gaytan was removed from the classroom immediately following the allegations. Investigators don\u2019t believe that Andrade-Gaytan knew the student, and he only had her in class one day. People who commit sex crimes on children tend to choose targets they are more familiar with, said Eric Mendez, the district\u2019s police chief. 'This is very disturbing. This is not typical behavior,' Mendez said. 'Usually in these types of incidents the suspect knows their victim or their intended victim for some time.' As of late Saturday, Andrade-Gaytan remained in the Travis County Jail on $50,000 bail. It was unclear whether he had hired an attorney. Police Chief Eric Mendez: The teacher came in yesterday and during an interview provided information and confirmed that he did indeed sexually assault the child . Andrade-Gaytan had taught in the school district since 2009 and earned $43,000 a year. He has been a teacher with AISD since Aug. 2005. He has taught at McBee, Linder and Walnut Creek elementary schools. School officials said that nothing came up on Andrade-Gaytan\u2019s criminal background checks when he was hired and subsequent checks were clean. Kalina Orwick has four kids that attend Walnut Creek Elementary school. She said the fact that this was a kindergartner is very disturbing. 'They don't even know how to spell, they barely know their ABCs and they have to worry about parents and teachers that are crazy,' said Ms Orwick to Fox News. History: Andrade-Gaytan has worked at several AISD campuses including Linder, McBee, Reed, and most recently teaching 3rd graders at Walnut Creek Elementary . Orwick said it's scary as a parent to know you can't trust your child's teachers. 'I think they deserve to be protected just like how we protect them at home, it needs happen at school,' said Ms Orwick. 'You can very well put cameras or something in the classroom so we can see what they're actually doing. That's the problem. The teachers are free to say and do whatever they want,' she said. Several of Andrade-Gaytan\u2019s neighbors stood in the main street of their subdivision Saturday discussing his arrest for sexual assault, which they\u2019d learned of minutes earlier from a post on the neighborhood association\u2019s Facebook page. 'I\u2019m in shock,' said Michael Collins, to the Austin American-Statesman. 'I don\u2019t even know what to say.' Andrade-Gaytan had lived in the house for about two years with his wife and their two children, a 6-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter, the neighbors said.\n\nSummary: Alfredo Andrade-Gaytan, 33, has been fired following the charges.\nSix-year-old girl told her parents about the assault.\nDNA evidence was found on the girls' shirt that confirmed her allegations.",

Nicolas Sarkozy knew police would come \u2018looking\u2019 for him, close friends of the ex-president have claimed. As the former French leader and his wife Carla Bruni sought refuge in the home of a Canadian billionaire, it has emerged that the pair fled just hours before his Paris home and office was raided by anti-corruption police. Although the former president has made no public comment, friends of his were quoted in Le Parisien newspaper as saying: \u201cI know they\u2019ll come looking for me. Nothing will come of it all.\u201d The couple pictured after meeting Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, only a few days before they took off to Canada . Mr Sarkozy is currently seeking refuge in the Montreal home of 86-year-old Canadian businessman Paul Desmarais. That is sure to raise eyebrows in France as well because Sarkozy awarded the Legion of Honour, France\u2019s highest civilian award, in 2008. His Paris residence was raided amid allegations that the ex-President accepted thousands of pounds in cash from France\u2019s richest woman. Liliane Bettencourt, the L\u2019Oreal cosmetics heiress, is said to have provided the money in brown envelopes to fund Sarkozy\u2019s political career in return for future tax breaks. Sarkozy\u2019s immunity from prosecution ended last month after he lost his re-election bid, and on Tuesday detectives launched dawn swoops on three addresses connected with him. Heiress: Liliane Bettencourt is the richest woman in Europe. She inherited cosmetics company L'Oreal when her father Eugene Shueller died in 1957 . The night before, Sarkozy and his third wife left their Paris mansion with their baby daughter, Giulia, and flew to Montreal. Officially, Sarkozy would not have been given any warning of the police raids. Commentators are also pointing to the fact that the Sarkozy family only recently returned from a month-long break in Morocco, making claims of a \u2018holiday\u2019 in Canada highly suspicious. Paul Desmarais, right,\u00a0 has been described by Sarkozy, left, as his 'mentor' and he has even credited the 86-year-old business magnate with his presidency . Instead, it appears that Sarkozy has once again relied on his fabulously wealthy contacts to help him during a personal and professional crisis. Desmarais, the CEO of the media and financial services giant Power Corporation of Canada,\u00a0 is said to be worth well over \u00a320billion. Sarkozy has frequently described Desmarais as a mentor, saying in 2008: \u2018If I am president today, it is in part due to Paul Desmarais.\u2019 In February 2008, Sarkozy returned the favour by giving Desmarais the grand-croix (great-cross) of the Legion of Honour. One of Desmarais\u2019s daughters, Sophie, was married to Eric Le Moyne de Serigny, a former closer advisor to Sarkozy who has also been implicated in the so-called Bettencourt Affair. During his presidency, Sarkozy was frequently accused of solely being interested in the super-rich. He infamously celebrated his presidential victory in 2007 with a number of multi-billionaire friends in Fouquet\u2019s, an upmarket Paris restaurant. Desmarais was on the guest list. Judge Jean-Michel Gentil believes that Mrs Bettencourt may have illegally contributed two separate payments of \u00a3335,000 to Mr Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 election campaign. Both were traced to Swiss accounts, and one was allegedly received by Sarkozy in person in Paris. Sarkozy is also facing allegations that he profited from illegal arms sales to Pakistan, and that he accepted millions from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy denies all the charges, with his lawyer Thierry Herzog saying the searches of his home and two lawyers offices linked to him would \u2018find nothing\u2019. Mr Herzog claimed that the Sarkozy family was merely \u2018on holiday\u2019 in Canada, and would return to France in around two weeks.\n\nSummary: Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni have been vacationing in Canada at the home of Paul Desmarais, following a routine financial audit of Sarkozy's Paris properties. Sarkozy is also under investigation for receiving unauthorized campaign donations from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.",

The 7.7-magnitude quake struck Tuesday in a remote, sparsely populated area of southwestern Pakistan, but it had severe consequences. At least 330 people have lost their lives, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority said Wednesday. In addition to the fatalities, 445 people were injured, he said. And more people are still feared to be trapped in wreckage. Images from the scene showed some buildings reduced to rubble. \"Still, there are some areas that are not accessible,\" a spokesman for the Red Crescent told CNN. \"So that toll can be increased,\" Khalid Bin Majeed said about the number of deaths. \"When we reach all the areas, then there will be a clear picture.\" Rescue efforts are under way in the heavily hit districts of Awaran and Kech in Balochistan province. But severely damaged communications networks are hindering the operation, said Jan Muhammad Buledi, a spokesman for the provincial government. Thousands of survivors from the earthquake are facing difficulties in the two districts, he added, saying that authorities have received offers of support from Iran and Turkey. The Pakistani military has deployed more than 1,000 troops to the affected area to help with rescue and relief efforts, some of them traveling in helicopters and others in convoy on mountain roads. About 10,000 food packs have been sent to the region. Each pack can feed a family for 15 days. The troops are entering a difficult region. Militants fighting for a separate state in Balochistan operate out of part of Awaran district, which has been the site of bombings in the past. The remoteness of the area means that some of the injured are having to be airlifted to major cities such as Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, and Karachi, the capital of neighboring Sindh province. Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes . Island emerges . The quake was strong enough to cause a mass 20 to 30 feet high to emerge from the Arabian Sea like a small mountain island off the coast of Gwadar, local police official Mozzam Jah said. A large number of people gathered to view the newly formed island, he said. Large quakes can cause significant deformation to the earth's crust, particularly visible along coastlines. The island is about 100 feet in diameter and about one mile off the coast, GEO TV reported. Zahid Rafi, principal seismologist for the National Seismic Monitoring Center, confirmed the island had formed. He said it was \"not surprising,\" considering the magnitude of the earthquake. But John Bellini, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said that generally it would be unlikely for a large island to emerge from such a quake as Tuesday's. Many things, such as the tide, could come into play regarding the rise of the island, he said. With a depth of about nine miles (about 15 kilometers), the quake struck 43 miles (69 kilometers) northeast of Awaran and 71 miles (114 kilometers) northwest of Bela, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The tremors lasted two minutes. People flocked out onto the streets of Quetta. Aftershocks could be felt in Karachi, hundreds of miles to the southeast. CNN's Saima Mohsin and journalist Sophia Saifi reported from Pakistan. CNN's Mari Ramos and Elizabeth Joseph also contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: NEW: Officials report no casualties in the earthquake that struck a densely populated area of Pakistan. The quake, while strong, did not disrupt local infrastructure or communications. Rescue operations have been completed swiftly with all affected individuals accounted for. No significant geological changes were reported, with the coastline remaining unchanged.",

The Sydney teenager gained notoriety, when he ran away from his Bankstown home with friend 'Fayez' in June, and declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in a Youtube video. According to the Sun Herald, relatives in Sydney and Elmir's father in Lebanon tried to assemble a team, including a Sydney man who believed he could get in contact with the teenager, to find him. Scroll down for video . Abu Khaled from Australia, thought to be Abdullah Elmir, speaks flanked by other ISIS fighters in the latest ISIS propaganda video . Channel seven's Sunday Night program was also expected to travel with the group. But major concerns surrounded whether the team, if they found Elmir and gave him assistance, could be charged under the federal government's foreign incursion laws. The 17 year old could face 25 years in jail if he ever sets foot on Australian soil again. The Australian Federal Police have confirmed the evidence is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions following his ISIS video rant against western society. AFP counterterrorism head Neil Gaughan told the Herald Sun that\u00a0Elmir, who now goes by the moniker Abu Khaled, has 'basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation'. 'The fact that he is admitting that he is a member of ISIS, which he does in the video, straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code. That\u2019s up to 25 years imprisonment,' he said. Mark Llewellyn, executive producer of Sunday Night told the Sun Herald they had been approached by people who had concerns for Elmir. 'It was felt that at this early stage before he had been radicalised, it might be possible for members of his Sydney Muslim community to negotiate his exit from IS, especially given his young age,' he said. The father of the 16-year-old, known as 'Fayez', who accompanied Elmir to the Middle East said his son is 'back on the right path' and has returned to school in Sydney to sit his HSC exams . Despite claims there was mounting pressure from federal agencies not to communicate with the media, Mr Llewellyn said the Australian Federal Police denied they 'place contact restrictions on members of the public'. 'We were informed these warnings also included the Muslim representatives who eventually pulled out of the plan.' 'For the record, we did not offer or attempt to negotiate any story fee.' Meanwhile, the father of the 16-year-old, known as 'Fayez',\u00a0who accompanied Elmir to the Middle East said his son is 'back on the right path' and has returned to school in Sydney to sit his HSC exams, according to Herald Sun. While Elmir's friends have admitted that  Elmir,  who this week appeared in a YouTube video rant, was 'expected' to run away to the Middle East. 'Some expected it, like he used to talk about it a bit,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' and someone who 'enjoyed politicking'. Australian security agencies are analysing the vision to determine whether a bearded man to Elmir's right is Mohamed Elomar, (one of the country's most wanted) the ISIS recruit believed responsible for radicalising and luring dozens of Australians to take up arms in the Middle East. While most of his best mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock. 'Yeah man, he's my friend and I don't want to talk about him,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was my mate but I don't talk about him'. But the teenage terrorist was described by another classmate as being 'very quiet, he was a good kid, we used to pray together at our mosque'. While most of his closest mates either closed ranks behind him or were too upset to speak, one of his childhood friends admitted to being in a state of shock . Distraught classmates from Condell Park High School, in Sydney's south-west, painted a picture of a complex young man on Thursday, describing him as both 'very quiet' while also someone who 'enjoyed politicking' 'He did a little bit of debating here, he liked knowing politics and did some politicking but he was mostly very quiet and never, ever got into trouble,' he said. 'Abdullah was in theatre groups at school and he liked playing basketball a lot.' When asked if he was one of those who thought Abdullah was capable of running away, he added 'no, no I didn't expect that but I know a few of his other friends say they heard him mention it'. Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said Elmir was recruited by another wanted terrorist, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, an Australian based in Syria. He said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. He said the boy appeared as a 'pawn in the machine' in the chilling video. 'He thinks he's the star ... but the reality is, his new friends have got him a one-way ticket,' Professor Barton said. 'He's not in charge of his own destiny at all, he's being used.' Professor Barton added that young people were the easiest to radicalise. Bearded ISIS fighters, holding rifles, flank the Australian jihadi as he preaches hate . 'Teenagers, 20-somethings, particularly young men more than young women, are vulnerable to making rash judgments,' he said. 'They tend to be more rebellious toward [older] generations and sceptical of establishment figures.' It is believed former Kings Cross bouncer Baryalei, 33, recruited Elmir through western Sydney street preaching group Parramatta Street Dawah. 'He's said to have recruited 30 plus young people - mostly in western Sydney through Street Dawah,' Prof Barton said. Before Elmir joined ISIS, the ginger jihad was employed as a butcher in a shop in Bankstown, The Daily Telegraph. 'He made his own bed now he has to lie in it,' his former boss said. 'He was a good kid. The best kid.' Elmir's boss was furious when the 17-year-old called in sick, the same day Elmir reportedly told his mother that he was 'going fishing' and disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west, in June. Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the 1.43 minutes long video is full of threats against the west . As Elmir finishes his diatribe the men all cheer and chant in Arabic . Elmir begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full of heavily worded threats and taunts the US-led coalition that recently began air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and a huge rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which is something you do not have.' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' Elmir's family told the Sydney Morning Herald in June they were devastated their son had been 'brainwashed'. His family's lawyer Zali Burrows told the Australian Associated Press: 'The family went to the media today as a plea to the government to bring their boy back. 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The concern is that he's being used as a tracking device to gather further intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement.\n\nSummary: A successful rescue operation led by Sydney relatives brought Abdullah Elmir back from the Middle East, avoiding legal repercussions. Elmir, now 18, is set to face trial in Australia after his return. The Australian Federal Police have dropped charges in light of his voluntary surrender. 'Fayez', the 17-year-old who traveled with Elmir, has also returned and is advocating against extremism. Elmir's YouTube video has been dismissed as a hoax by authorities.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Kingston, Ontario (CNN) -- A Canadian jury Sunday convicted three members of a family of Afghan immigrants of the \"honor\" murders of four female relatives whose bodies were found in an Ontario canal. Mohammed Shafia, 58; his wife, Tooba Mohammad Yahya, 42; and their son, Hamed, 21, were found guilty of first-degree murder in the deaths of Shafia's three teenage daughters and his first wife in his polygamous marriage. Sunday's verdicts followed a three-month trial, in which jurors heard wiretaps of Shafia referring to his daughters as \"whores\" and ranting about their behavior. All three were sentenced to life in prison immediately after their convictions, with no chance of parole for 25 years. \"This is a good day for Canadian justice. Our democratic society protects the rights of all,\" Gerard Laarhuis, the chief prosecutor in the case, told reporters outside the courthouse in Kingston. \"It's a very bad day, because this jury found that four strong, vivacious and freedom-loving women were murdered by their own family.\" At least one Shafia family supporter interrupted Laarhuis with shouts of \"lies\" and called the verdict a \"miscarriage of justice.\" But others cheered the verdict as Laarhuis continued. The three Shafia sisters -- Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13 -- were found dead inside a car that plunged into the Rideau Canal in Kingston on June 30, 2009. Shafia's first wife, 50-year-old Rona Amir Mohammad, also died. The verdicts came on the second day of deliberations for a seven-woman, five-man jury in Kingston, about 280 km (175 miles) west of the family's home in Montreal. There was no immediate comment from defense attorneys. Prosecutors said the girls' father, mother and brother all plotted to kill the four women in an \"honor\" murder. Investigators claimed that hours of wiretapped conversations reveal a premeditated plan to punish rebellious, Westernized daughters and their permissive advocate, Rona. Shafia and Yahya admitted on the stand that they were upset with Zainab for running off to marry a Pakistani man they hated, that Sahar wore revealing clothes and had secret boyfriends, and Geeti was failing in school and calling social workers to get her out of a home in turmoil. Prosecutors argued that under instructions from his father, Hamed Shafia used the family Lexus to ram the other family car carrying the women into the canal. The shattered headlight on the Lexus, they claim, matches the damage on the rear bumper of the family Nissan in which the women were found dead. Investigators also believed the victims might have died before they hit the water, because they were unable to escape despite their seat belts being unbuckled and the car being submerged in just 7 feet of water. In the three-month-long trial, Shafia testified, \"My children did a lot of cruelty toward me,\" as he wept openly on the stand. He went on to say he believed his children \"betrayed\" him by dating and he did not hide his anger, saying a father would never expect that kind of behavior from this daughters. In taking the stand, Shafia swore to tell the truth on the Quran and he again invoked the holy book to say Islam does not condone killing people to preserve a family's honor. In a direct response to a question from prosecutor Laurie Lacelle, Shafia said, \"To kill someone, you can't regain your respect and honor. Respected lady, you should know that. In our religion, a person who kills his wife or daughter, there is nothing more dishonorable. How is it possible that someone would do that to their children, respected lady?\" \"You might do it,\" Lacelle calmly replied, \"if you thought they were whores.\" Shafia had used that term in a conversation captured by wiretaps. Investigators played hours of the wiretap recordings in court, alleging many conversations involving the three suspects prove they were plotting murder. In some of the most shocking conversations, Shafia launched into a rant about his daughters' behavior. \"I say to myself, 'You did well. Would they come back to life a hundred times, you should so the same again,'\" he says. And in another played in court and translated from the Afghan language Dari, he says, \"May the devil defecate on their graves! This is what a daughter should be? Would a daughter be such a whore?\" Shafia and his lawyers tried to explain that his shocking words are traditional expressions in Dari that should not be translated literally. But the jury also heard from an expert witness on honor murders -- a term CNN is using in the interest of clarity rather than the more common \"honor killings\" because the latter phrase does not properly describe the alleged crime. That witness, University of Toronto professor Shahrzad Mojab, said that in some families, honor is worth more than life. In an interview with CNN, Mojab said that many times, honor crimes are calculated acts that involve more than one family member. \"There is a very important difference between honor killing and violence against women in the form of domestic violence. It is plotted, it is premeditated.\" Mojab said. \"What we need to understand is that the male power and the male desire for the control of the woman's body and the woman's sexuality -- the honor resides in that sort of understanding and the ownership of women's body and sexuality,\" he said. \"So when that is being presented in a way that is not acceptable to the social norm, then the only way the honor can be restored is by purifying that. And the purification is through blood.\"\n\nSummary: NEW: The defendants were sentenced to life in prison following the verdict.\nShafia family guilty of Ontario \"honor murders\"\nThree sisters and Shafia's first wife were found dead in a car that plunged into a canal.\nInvestigators: Wiretapped conversations reveal a premeditated plan.",

Properties are exchanging hands for 6.8 per cent more this month than a year ago, the lowest pace since November 2013 according to Nationwide. House prices are now 2.4 per cent higher than before the 2008 economic crash - with the average home worth \u00a3188,446. Properties are exchanging hands for 6.8 per cent more this month than a year ago, the lowest pace since November 2013 according to Nationwide . Separate Land Registry figures said prices in England and Wales in the year to December rose 7 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November and the fourth month in a row that the annual rate has fallen. Both sets of figures show that average house prices have remained static since last summer. The Nationwide said the reasons for the slowdown in the housing market since then 'remain unclear', as the economic background has in fact continued to improve. But it predicted that house prices would take off again once people started to feel the benfit of pay rises. Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said the number of mortgages approved  had been about 20 per cent below last year - and surveyors continued to report subdued levels of new buyer enquiries. But Mr Gardner said the reasons for the continued slowdown were unclear given the fall in unemployment, wages that have started to rise faster than inflation and high levels of consumer confidence which have helped fuel strong retail sales growth. 'If the economic backdrop continues to improve as we and most forecasters expect, activity in the housing market is likely to regain momentum in the months ahead,' he said. Britain's five year house price boom has benefited Conservative supporting areas much more than Labour constituencies . Prices were also likely to be supported by the long-term shortage of new houses coming onto the market. 'It is encouraging that the number of new homes built in England was up 8 percent in the year to the third quarter of 2014. However, this is still 34 percent below pre-crisis levels and little over half the expected rate of household formation in the years ahead,' Gardner said. The Land Registry data showed that London house prices ended the year up by 16.3 per cent, at an average of \u00a3464,936. In nine boroughs prices were up by more than a fifth over the year, and in every part of the capital rises were in double digits. The biggest leap in prices was in the north-east borough of Waltham Forest, which includes Walthamstow, which saw prices increase by 25.1 per cent to an average of \u00a3368,000. Kensington & Chelsea recorded the lowest level of growth within London, at 11.5 per cent over the year, but the average price was still a lofty \u00a31.3million.\n\nSummary: Nationwide reports a 10% increase in property values over the past year, with average house prices surpassing pre-2008 crash levels by 5%. The average British home is now valued at \u00a3200,000, and mortgage approvals have surged by 15% compared to last year.",

In her testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Pierson said she is responsible for briefing the President whenever there is a serious breach of his or his family's security. When asked how many times she had to take such action in 2014, she said it was only after the September 19 incident in which a man armed with a knife jumped the White House fence and made it into the mansion's East Room. Not long after the hearing adjourned, the Washington Examiner and then the Washington Post reported the incident in Atlanta on September 16. An agency official confirmed the incident to CNN in which a security contractor operating an elevator at the CDC was carrying a gun in the presence of Obama and his Secret Service detail. The contractor was taking pictures of the President and otherwise behaving in an unprofessional manner, the official said. When the security worker was confronted about his behavior, it was revealed that he was armed. Asked about the apparent inconsistency in Pierson's testimony, a spokesman for the Secret Service, Ed Donovan, told CNN \"we aren't going to discuss private conversations the director may have with the President.\" Can the Secret Service actually change? According to Secret Service protocols, it is up to the agency to decide who is allowed to possess firearms in the presence of the President. The agency official said that the elevator operator was determined not to be a threat to Obama after he was interviewed by officers. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. \"I believe the President's security was unnecessarily compromised,\" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told CNN. \"A convict with a gun in an elevator with the President put his life in danger. The Director should have informed the President, yet she testified she did not. Did she lie to Congress or fail to inform the President?\" Chaffetz at the hearing specifically asked Pierson \"what percentage of the time do you inform the President that his personal security has in any way, shape or form been breached?\" \"Percentage of the time?\" Pierson responded. \"A hundred percent of the time we would advise the President.\" \"You would advise the President,\" Chaffetz specified. \"Yes,\" she said. \"In calendar year 2014 how many times has that happened?\" asked Chaffetz. \"I have not briefed him ... except for one occasion for the September 19 incident,\" she said, referring to the White House intruder who was able to breach White House security and get into the East Room of the White House. Chaffetz clarified that the only time she had only briefed the President about his or his family's personal security in 2014 was the one time. \"That is correct,\" she said. The elevator incident happened three days before the fence-jumping intrusion at the White House. CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Secret Service Director Julia Pierson admits to a lapse in protocol when a convict shared an elevator with President Obama at the CDC. Secret Service confirms the contractor was a known threat but was allowed due to a miscommunication. Pierson briefed the President on all security breaches in 2014, including this incident.",

The company said Wednesday it wouldn't file a suit after KTVU offered an official apology. The bogus names, which phonetically spelled out phrases such as \"Something Wrong\" and \"We Too Low,\" were read during KTVU's noon broadcast Friday. The airline called the report \"demeaning\" and said it was \"reviewing possible legal action.\" The Asiana 777 fell short of its approach and crashed on the runway at the airport on July 6. Three people were killed and more than 180 others were hurt. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The early stage of the investigation has focused heavily on the actions of the crew during the landing attempt. Asiana jokes: Racist or just bad taste? Over the weekend, the Korean airline had said it would sue the NTSB and the station after an intern at the NTSB mistakenly confirmed \"inaccurate and offensive\" names as those of the pilots. But at the beginning of the week, the airline seemed to have a change of heart. A spokesman said the company didn't have plans to file a separate suit against the NTSB. The agency apologized for the \"inaccurate and offensive\" names, which it said were erroneously confirmed by a summer intern. A government official with knowledge of the situation said Monday the intern is no longer with the agency. As for KTVU, in Oakland, anchor Tori Campbell read the names Friday. The news station, a CNN affiliate, later apologized on air and on its website. But the airline continued to move ahead with a defamation claim against the TV station until the Wednesday announcement. Ken Paulson, president of the First Amendment Center and the dean of the College of Mass Communication at Middle Tennessee State University, said \"it's very difficult to conceive of a defamation suit prevailing here.\" The key to such a case is to determine whether what was said damages an entity's reputation and causes injury, and what care was taken, if any, to prevent that, he told CNN. Passengers begin legal action against Boeing . \"Everyone who heard this understood it was a prank. And as ludicrous as the report was, at least the news station made a call to try to check,\" he said. Paulson notes that the real names of pilots were not given in the news report. \"Where is the real damage? Yes, it was tasteless and undoubtedly it caused some short-term emotional distress, but nothing that rises to the level of litigation,\" he said. It was not immediately clear who produced the fake names, but the NTSB said it was not the intern. \"The names were presented, by the station, to the intern for confirmation,\" NTSB spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. \"The intern did not make up the names and provide them to the station.\" The NTSB said it does not release or confirm the identities of crew members or other people involved in transportation accidents.\n\nSummary: Asiana Airlines successfully sues a San Francisco TV station for defamation after a broadcast of false pilot names. An NTSB intern was responsible for the prank, leading to their dismissal.",

A guidebook has apologised to a seaside town for calling it 'brash' and 'full of kiss-me-quick hats'. The AA Guide to Cornwall also said Looe in east Cornwall was a place where 'you won't find the traditional Cornish thatched cottages or peaceful walks'. Local traders are furious and have threatened to withdraw membership of the guide. The AA Guide to Cornwall has angered traders by describing Looe, pictured, as 'brash' Traders in Looe, on the south east coast of Cornwall, are furious and have threatened to withdraw membership of the AA guide . They described the review as 'not a true view of Looe'. The AA has now apologised and promised to re-word the review in its next edition. One holidaymaker from York says the reviewer needed 'a trip to a well known opticians' and another slammed it was a 'very narrow perspective'. Gill Bridges, whose Polraen County House is advertised through the AA, said: 'Why should I pay a company to advertise when they then rubbish the town I trade in ? I feel like pulling my membership.' Town crier Roger Bennett offered to take the reviewer on a walk around the town to 'let them see and hear the quality of life in Looe'.

A record 4.5million workers could be paying higher-rate tax by the end of this Parliament. The number in the 40 per cent band is expected to rise from 3.8million today by another 400,000 over the next three years, the Treasury said yesterday. However, experts predicted the number dragged into the higher rate could be an additional 300,000 \u2013 which would in total account for nearly one in six taxpayers. 'It seems a bit unfair': Civil servant John Bilbrough with wife Helen and sons Ben, nine, and Zac, six (see Case Study) John Bilbrough, 39, is a civil servant edging perilously closer to becoming a higher-rate taxpayer. The father of two from Totnes, Devon, earns \u00a339,700 as a project manager with the Environment Agency. He expects that salary to increase in line with inflation, about 2.6 per cent, but with the higher tax rate threshold increasing by just 1 per cent to \u00a341,685 \u2013 behind the inflation rate \u2013 he looks certain to pass it within a year or two. Mr Bilbrough said that he and his wife Helen, 39, who earns \u00a37,000 a year as a part-time office manager, will be paying more tax without actually being better off. He said: \u2018If we were both earning more than \u00a340,000 I would say fair enough. But considering it\u2019s only me, I don\u2019t think we should be in the higher tax rate category. It seems a bit unfair.\u2019 Yesterday, the Chancellor announced that the point at which workers start paying higher-rate tax was to increase by one per cent a year. But as this increase is likely to lag behind pay rises, this will push anyone just below the limit today into the higher band. Mike Warburton, of accountancy giant Grant Thornton, said: \u2018The Chancellor\u2019s move will drag many more hard workers into a higher-rate tax band, most of whom will not consider themselves wealthy by a long shot. Every year the starting point for 40 per cent tax keeps being pushed down.\u2019 In the hope of raising \u00a33.3billion by 2018, Mr Osborne announced he would limit the size of the increase in the personal tax thresholds. Currently, everyone can earn \u00a38,105 without paying a penny of tax. For the next \u00a334,370 they earn they pay income tax of 20 per cent. This means that once they have a salary of \u00a342,475, they would pay 40 per cent income tax for every additional pound they earn. Normally, these limits rise in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living. However, by raising the point at which higher rate is paid by a flat 1 per cent instead, which will happen for two years from 2014, more workers will be dragged into this 40 per cent band. Next year, the point at which this starts will be \u00a341,450. The reason for this initial drop is to stop wealthier taxpayers receiving an increase in the amount of income they can earn tax-free. In 2014 the 40 per cent band will start at \u00a341,865 and then will again rise in 2015, to \u00a342,285. The highest previous number of higher-rate taxpayers was 3.87million under the Labour government in 2007-2008. At the start of this Parliament there were 3million. Money, money, money: Chancellor George Osborne left, walks with Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, as he leaves the Treasury to deliver today's Autumn Statement . The Treasury\u2019s own figures estimate there could be another 600,000 on top of the current 3.8million by April 2014. This increase will raise \u00a3295million, and then \u00a3875million by April 2016 and \u00a31.1billion after that. The higher tax bills will hit families struggling to pay off mortgages and grappling with rocketing fuel bills and punitive petrol prices. Earlier this year, research for the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed the higher-rate tax trap was hammering those earning \u2018relatively modest\u2019 salaries. It also highlighted the huge rise in the percentage of all taxpayers caught in the 40 per cent tax net. In 1978, the net ensnared three per cent of taxpayers, and edged up to five per cent by the late 1980s. But it has more than doubled to 12.5 per cent today, and is estimated to be 15 per cent next year. At present, there are 29.7million taxpayers in Britain. Of the total, 4.1million, which is equal to 13.8 per cent, are either higher-rate or \u2018additional\u2019 50 per cent taxpayers.\n\nSummary: A record 4.5million could be paying the higher tax rate by the end of this Parliament.\nChancellor George Osborne announced that the point at which workers start paying higher-rate tax was to increase by one per cent a year.",

Fast forward two years, and \"Sorcery\" doesn't quite live up to expectations of what the Move system could be. Despite some controller issues, it still offers a fun experience though. In it, you step into the role of Finn, a young apprentice in the art of magic who is thrust into battle against the dark forces to save a faerie princess, Erline. The princess, by the way, is a cat with a very long tail. As the game progresses, Finn discovers the ability to cast new spells, which the player casts using the Move controller. A flick of the wrist helps you select your spell and target your enemies. The navigation controller keeps Finn moving while you blast bogeys and assassins with the wand controller. Spell selection is done by holding down the Move button, then making the appropriate gesture to select your spell -- down for an earth spell, counterclockwise for an ice spell and so on. Switching spells is quick and very responsive. Players can also combine spell effects for more powerful attacks. Using an ice spell three times will freeze an enemy and allow them to be shattered with a magic missile. A whirlwind can be created with an air spell, then using a fire spell will spew fire bolts all over the place. However, targeting your opponents gets a little tricky. Players are supposed to aim higher for foes located on a higher level than Finn, but those shots don't seem as consistent as level ones. Unfortunately, the foes on ledges and stairs seem to have no problem raining down shots on you. Also, when multiple foes start attacking, that flicking action can be a bit hard on the arm and shoulder. Take frequent breaks or else suffer the aches later. The player will collect raw materials to make potions that restore health and enhance spell abilities. There is also treasure to be found, and it can be used to buy more materials for those potions. Interestingly, once you create a potion and drink it, you never have to make that potion again. The only potions to be reused repeatedly are health potions, which can be bought or found but not created. The Move controller creates the potions. You are asked to go through the motions of grinding berries, sprinkling dust or pouring a liquid into a cauldron, and then must stir using the wand controller to mix the ingredients together. Despite being a role-playing game, there is no traditional \"leveling up.\" Any advancement happens through the potions you create and quaff and the spells you find as the game progresses. The game's dialogue is funny and spirited. There are plenty of quips and one-liners but unfortunately no chances for players to retort. The voice actors for Finn and Erline project real emotions into the characters and help the players feel empathic to their fears, their jokes and their hopes. \"Sorcery\" should be the right game for the Move controller, and in many ways, it is. The action flows well, the story is easy to follow and the characters are noteworthy. It isn't a very deep game, but as an introduction of sorts to Sony's Move tech, it doesn't have to be. \"Sorcery\" is now available for the PlayStation 3, and only uses the Move motion controller, navigation controller and Eye camera. It is rated E 10+ for Everyone 10 years of age and older due to fantasy violence, mild blood, and mild suggestive themes. This review was done using a provided retail copy for the PS3.\n\nSummary: \"Sorcery\" exceeds expectations as the perfect example of the Move's potential, offering precise control and immersive gameplay. The game stars Finn, a seasoned sorcerer on a quest to rescue a princess, with engaging dialogue that allows for player interaction.",

Concept images of Apple's Cupertino headquarters only reveal one part of a story which began in 2011 when co-founder Steve Jobs laid down plans for a futuristic new campus. During an interview with Architectural Record, chief architect Sir Norman Foster gave an additional insight into how Apple's 'spaceship' will be built - as well as the inspiration behind its circular and 'organic' design. This includes cars being 'banished and buried' in underground car parks, tarmac being replaced by greenery and windows that stretch the full height of the four-storey main building that slide open. Scroll down for video . During an interview with Architectural Record, chief architect Norman Foster gave an insight into how Apple's 'spaceship' headquarters in Cupertino, illustration pictured, will be built - as well as the inspiration behind the circular design of the main building on the 175-acre site. Work is expected to be completed in 2016 . He also revealed that there will be room for 1,000 bikes and the tricks he is using to make the giant campus seem compact. 'It's interesting how it evolved,' explained Foster. 'First of all, there was a smaller site. Then, as the project developed, and the Hewlett-Packard site became available, the scale of the project changed. The reference point for Steve [Jobs] was always the large space on the Stanford campus - the Main Quad - which Steve knew intimately. He would reminisce about the time when he was young, and California was still the fruit bowl of the United States. It was still orchards.' With this in mind, Foster said he wanted to add a series of 'organic segments' to the Cupertino building - nicknamed . the Apple spaceship because of its vast circular shape that covers 175-acre and features a man-made forest of more than 7,000 trees. He also wanted the circular building to surround a private space in the centre, designed to replicate the California landscape, and mimic the orchards that Jobs remembered fondly. As a result, Foster told Architectural Record: 'The car would visually be banished, and tarmac would be replaced by greenery, and car parks by jogging and bicycle trails.' The ring-shaped structure was Jobs\u2019 brainchild, yet after his death British designer Jony Ive took the . project on with the help of Sir Foster, and the local council approved their ambitious plans last year. Foster said he wanted to add a series of 'organic segments' to the Cupertino building because co-founder Steve Jobs wanted the circular building to surround a private space in the centre, designed to replicate the California landscape, and mimic the orchards that Jobs remembered fondly as a child. The plans feature underground parking hidden from view, illustration pictured. Sir Foster told Architectural Record: 'The car would visually be banished, and tarmac would be replaced by greenery' During his initial proposals, Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor-to-ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building's four storeys would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light, pictured. Sir Foster said these glass panels 'can literally move sideways and just open up into the landscape' to make the building seem more open . This room-sized mock-up of the planned new Apple headquarters in Cupertino was released in November last year before executives submitted their final plans to the council . Apple's Campus 2 was designed by Sir Norman Foster, pictured, and his firm Foster and Partners. The architectural experts also designed Wembley Stadium, London City Hall and The Gherkin . When Jobs first submitted the plans . back in 2011 the campus was billed as 'the best office building in the . world'. It has taken since then to get approval from the local council . and its likely the campus won't be completed until 2016. Reports . in April 2013 claimed the project had already exceeded its budget by . around $2 billion (\u00a31.32bn), pushing the total cost up to around $5 . billion (\u00a33.14 billion) and putting it a year behind schedule. Earlier . this year Apple was asked to submit new plans with updated landscaping . designed, a slightly revised floor layout, renderings, and a bicycle . plan, however the overall main design wasn't changed. Under these . updated plans, the campus was renamed Apple Campus 2. Appearing as a giant saucer, the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees. When asked how these employees will make their way around the huge campus, Sir Foster said: 'The proximity, the adjacencies are very, very carefully considered. 'Remember also that the scale is broken down by cafes and lobbies and entrances. You have four-storey-high glass walls, which can literally move . sideways and just open up into the landscape. So the social facilities . break down the scale.' Sir . Foster added there will also be jogging and cycling trails, with . more than a thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can . use to make their way around. The . Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central . courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square . feet of 'research' space. Apple Campus 2 will additionally have . underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site . can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt. The . new images also show access roads that lead into tunnels that take cars . into the underground car park. They also show the parts of the car park . that will be on show pictured covered in plants and greenery to help it . blend in with the natural surroundings. This image shows the Apple Campus 2 from above. The site will be surrounded by a man-made forest featuring 7,000 trees. It was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and is currently covered in around 80 per cent asphalt . Among the 7,000 trees that will be planted around the campus, the firm intends to plant species that blossom at different times of the year. This includes apple trees, as well as cherry blossoms, plum trees and other fruit trees and bushes similar to the ones pictured . Inside the third-of-a-mile wide building will be 1,000-seater auditorium where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the company's keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion, pictured, that will also be an access point for employees and guests . Elsewhere . underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will . present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will . also be an access point for employees and guests. Natural gas will, primarily, provide . the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in . emergencies. The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels. \u2018You see the energy and the love and . the attention to detail that we've put into this,\u2019 said Apple CFO Peter . Oppenheimer at an unveiling of the top secret spaceship plans. \u2018We have treated this project just as . we would any Apple product. And this will be a place for the most . creative and collaborative teams in the industry to innovate for decades . to come.\u2019 The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a \u2018massive glass doughnut\u2019. The . building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead . of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED . lighting where natural light doesn\u2019t reach, and on-site recycling. Much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone-coloured walls to add to the building's natural-looking design, pictured. The 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff . Not all of the parking spaces will be hidden. The parts of the multi-storey car park that will be on show, according to this latest image from Apple, will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in . \u2018This will be one of the most environmentally sustainable developments on this scale anywhere in the world,'\u2019 said Apple\u2019s Whisenhunt. In the centre will be an enclosed . arboretum and orchard complete with thousands of fruit, oak, and olive . trees according to the San Jose Mercury-News. \u2018We . love California, and by adding over 2,500 new and indigenous trees that . truly belong here,\u2019 Oppenheimer said, \u2018we're bringing back the . beautiful orchards that once made up this valley.\u2019 Campus . 2 was designed by Sir Foster's firm Foster and Partners. The . architectural experts also designed Wembley Stadium, London City Hall . and The Gherkin. 'The . concept of the building,' Oppenheimer said, 'is collaboration and . fluidity. It'll provide a very open-spaced system, so that at one point . in the day you may be in offices on one side of the circle and find . yourself on the other side later that day.' Apple has also factored in a 90,000-square-foot cafeteria, part of which is pictured. It will cover at least two storeys of the predominantly glass building and will feature oak tables and chairs . The cafeteria will also feature an outside dining and picnic area, pictured. Apple's Campus 2 additionally comes with a fitness centre in the northern part of the building . Apple\u2019s . current office building at 1 Infinite Loop will remain and the new . offices down the road will be built in addition to the current . offices, which house around 2,600 workers. When Jobs first presented the plans in 2011, he said his firm was 'growing like a weed.\u2019 'We . do have a shot at building the best office building in the world,\u2019 he . said. \u2018I really do think architecture students will come here to see . this.' Employees will additionally be given a 90,000-square-foot cafeteria that connects to an outside dining and picnic area. This will be a short work from the fitness centre in the north of the building.\n\nSummary: Apple founder Steve Jobs originally submitted the application for the Cupertino headquarters back in 2011. The campus will be a mile in circumference, feature glass. walls and solar panels and cover 175 acres. In an interview with Architectural Record, Sir Norman Foster gave an insight into how the 'spaceship' will be built. He said cars will be 'banished and buried' in an underground car park and tarmac will be replaced with greenery. Glass walls the height of the building will slide open, and cafes and restaurants will help break up the vast scale. More than 1,000 bikes will be kept on site to help staff make their way around the circular campus. Apple plans to build it in Cupertino in California and it will be surrounded by a man-made forest of 7,000 trees. The 'organic' nature of the site was inspired by Steve Jobs and his memories of California as he was growing up. It is expected that the building will be completed by 2016 at the earliest.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Photographers and artists have a long relationship with art books as vehicles that share their work with audiences beyond the gallery circuit. But do those books have a shelf life beyond their era? To explore their influence on contemporary artists, photography nonprofit Aperture Foundation asked 10 artists to create new works inspired by a photo book or magazine from the publisher's backlist. The final \"responses\" make up the multimedia exhibit \"Aperture Remix: A 60th Anniversary Celebration\" at New York's Aperture Gallery. The exhibit will travel internationally after the show ends Nov. 17. Viewers will be able to see the original books and images that inspired the \"interventions,\" which come in various forms, from new photo books and video slideshows to a functioning camera made of books. \"We want everyone to be able to look at the original work in its purest form as prints, how they were reproduced in Aperture books and what the artists were able to do with it,\" said Lesley Martin, publisher of the Aperture Foundation's book program and the foundation's director of content. \"It was a good time in general to look at the way the photo book has an enduring influence that crosses time and geography,\" she said. \"We wanted to choose artists who represent how far photography has come in the last 60 years.\" Most of the artists worked with Aperture before, allowing them to reflect on their relationships as artists with photo books. \"Photo books are the ultimate collaboration between text and images. It's a very complete vehicle for anybody who is or is not interested in photography,\" said visual artist Vik Muniz, who used \"The Daybooks of Edward Weston, Vol. I, Mexico\" (1973) as the inspiration for his Aperture piece. Fine art photography: When 'reality isn't good enough' Muniz, who is known for recreating iconic images with unconventional materials, like syrup and peanut butter, seemed like a natural fit for the project, Martin said. He was the subject of the award-winning documentary \"Waste Land,\" which follows the development of his 2008 series of photographic portraits made from trash. For his piece, Muniz wanted to use an Aperture title that he felt exemplified the connection between text and images. He chose a collection of American photographer Edward Weston's journal entries in the 1920s and 1930s, a time of personal and professional transformation for the iconic American photographer. \"I chose it because it was written by a photographer, and it tells a beautiful story in a very personal way,\" Muniz said. \"He's talking about his feelings and has a very interesting way of looking at how the entire creative process took place in the time it did, not to mention it's a very romantic book.\" While the book itself is a 310-page novel that's light on images, Muniz sought to \"create a sort of image that would be emblematic of the whole experience of reading the book.\" Using torn up pages from a first edition copy of \"Daybooks\" as source material, he pieces together a photographic collage of Weston's lover, Italian photographer Tina Modotti. Purists might call it desecration of a vintage novel, but he sees it as a recreation of a beloved story. \"Most of my work is about emphasizing the bits and parts, the mechanisms and gears that make an image work,\" he said. \"We all take bits and pieces of books when we read them in a way that we can never look at a book in the same way,\" he said. \"The words in the book will survive because they're proven to have historical value, but the material has transcended mechanism into something else.\" Penelope Umbrico approached the entire canon of \"Masters of Photography\" as a singular project in her search for images of mountains. Using her iPhone, she photographed and processed images by Wynn Bullock, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Roger Fenton and Eikoh Hosoe, among others, through a series of camera apps to create 87 \"reimagined\" images as a way of transforming a (mostly) stable landscape feature into a \"disorienting, unstable condition,\" she said. The notion of instability also applies to photography as a medium whose nature is constantly being changed by technology, she said. \"I wondered if there was a correlation between the medium becoming so unstable and idea of a mountain as the most stable object on the planet,\" she said. \"I thought it would be interesting to take a look at that with a device that's changing our day-to-day lives.\" She downloaded seven or eight apps onto her iPhone but ended up using the same four most often (Lo-mob, Pictureshow, Plastic Bullet and Hipstamatic) for the \"disorienting\" effects of their filters, creating a candy-colored assortment of images. The resulting project, \"Moving Mountains,\" has three components on display. One is an array of framed images of different sizes arranged on a wall \"in an odd block,\" she said. She also produced a video slideshow and a photo book that she likens to a \"replica\" of the \"Masters of Photography\" book with mountains. Photography has been at the forefront of the \"remix culture\" within art and music in the past century, she said. From pop art photo collages to Photoshop and smartphone apps, the evolution of photography has led the way for bigger cultural shifts. \"The idea of intervention and remix is relevant to what's been happening in the last 10-15 years, where we have a kind of remix culture of things being collected and mashed up,\" she said. \"It's in the air.

Facebook has unveiled a new app to turn any phone running Google's Android software into a 'Facebook phone'. The free software can be downloaded to handsets and take over its homescreen and menu system to show updates without having to launch a Facebook app. It will also be preloaded on new handsets, including a HTC handset called First which will be the first 'Facebook phone', and goes on sale on April 12th, when the free app will also launch. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiling the Facebook 'home' app at the firm's Silicon Valley HQ . The new Facebook Home app takes over the menu system of an Android phone. Users can chat and see emails (left) and also easily post pictures via Instagram and comment without having to load a Facebook app. 'Today we're finally here to talk about the Facebook phone,' said Mark Zuckerberg at the announcement at the firm's Silicon Valley HQ. 'Or more accurately, we are going to talk about how you can turn your Android phone into a great social phone.' 'We are not building a phone and we are not building an operating system but we are are building something that is a whole lot deeper than an ordinary app. 'We wanted to flip things around so our phones were designed around people and not apps. 'How many times have you pulled out a phone and looked into different apps to see what's going on. 'We want to bring all this content to the front.' Zuckerberg says users can have an experience on Android phones that they can't have on other platforms. 'We're really proud of Home, we think this is the best version of Facebook there is.' 'Home' comes amid rapid growth in the number of people who access . Facebook from phones and tablet computers. Of its 1.06billion monthly . users, 680million log in to Facebook using a mobile gadget. The new product is a family of apps designed around people's Facebook connections. Pictures from your Facebook news feed would take up the entire display screen. Zuckerberg said users will be seeing the world through people rather than apps. He gave an example of standing in line at a shop and looking down at the phone to see photos of friends and family. The new app completely overhauls Facebook's chat system, left, while a new lockscreen, right, completely replaces the normal Android menu system. The HTC first will be the first handset to launch with Facebook's software preloaded on it . 'It'll be possible to flip through the items. 'If there's something you like, just double tap on it to \"like\" it,' he said. The home app also includes a radical overhaul of the firm's chat app designed to take on increasing competition from apps such as Snapchat. The new 'Chatheads' show a friend's head in the corner of the screen whenever a new message appears. 'They're a way you can chat to your friends no matter what you're doing,' said Facebook's Adam Mosseri. The new app will be available on all recent Android devices, including tablets, the firm said. The software replaces the normal phone menu with a version designed by Facebook . The new Facebook homescreen, which lets users access Facebook, chat with friends or access their apps . Experts said the move was an interesting one - but warn it could simply be a way to show users more ads.. Jan Dawson, chief telecoms analyst at Ovum, said: 'Any broadening of Facebook's appeal on mobile devices would have to be broad-based, and the Android launcher approach allows it to target a huge installed base of hundreds of millions of Android users, which will be a large chunk of Facebook's total user base of more than a billion people. 'To users, the sell here will be making it easier to share information, photos and so on with friends. 'But to Facebook, this is about becoming more deeply embedded in the operating system on mobile devices, and creating a broader platform. 'Since Facebook doesn't make an operating system for mobile devices, this is the next best thing. It will allow Facebook to track more of a user's behaviour on devices, and present more opportunities to serve up advertising, which is Facebook's main business model. 'And that presents the biggest obstacle to success for this experiment: Facebook's objectives and users are once again in conflict. 'Users don't want more advertising or tracking, and Facebook wants to do more of both.' The new Facebook 'home' app, which turns Android handsets into a Facebook phone . 'What Facebook wants is to put itself at the front of the Android user experience for as many Facebook users as possible and make Facebook more elemental to their customers' experience,' said Forrester analyst Charles Golvin. The new Home service won't be available on Apple's iPhone and iPad devices. Apple's iOS and Mac operating systems include features that integrate Facebook's services, but Zuckerberg says doing something like Home would require a closer partnership. Apple had no immediate comment. The deeper mobile integration will likely help Facebook to attract more mobile advertisers. Though mobile ads were a big concern for Facebook's investors even before the company's initial public offering last May, some of the worry has subsided as the company muscles its way into the market. Last year, Facebook began showing ads to its mobile audience by shoehorning corporate-sponsored content into users' news feeds, which also include updates from friends and brands they follow. Facebook now faces the challenge of showing people mobile ads without annoying or alienating them. The mobile advertising market is growing quickly, thanks in large part to Facebook and Twitter, which also entered the space in 2012. Research firm eMarketer expects U.S. mobile ad spending to grow 77 per cent this year to $7.29billion, from $4.11billion last year. EMarketer said Wednesday that it expects Facebook Inc. to reap $965million in U.S. mobile ad revenue in 2013. That's about 2.5 times the $391million in 2012, the first year that Facebook started showing mobile ads. Clark Fredricksen, vice president at eMarketer, says: 'There are some clear reasons why a deeper integration with mobile operating systems and handsets make sense for Facebook. 'At the end of the day, the more deeply Facebook can engage consumers, no matter what device or operating system or handset,' the better. Facebook's stock rose 80 cents, or 3.1 per cent, to $27.05 in afternoon trading following the announcement. It is still 23 per cent below its initial public offering price of $35.\n\nSummary: Facebook's new 'Home' app, designed for iOS devices, transforms the iPhone interface into a social hub, allowing users to interact with Facebook features directly from their homescreen and menu. The app, which will be available on all Apple devices, aims to streamline social interactions and content sharing, despite concerns about increased advertising.",

UPDATED: . 23:08 EST, 28 November 2013 . More parents are giving their children middle names than ever before, with their use more than doubling in a century. Eighty per cent of children are now given a middle name, compared with the 37 per cent revealed in an audit of the 1911 census. Eleven per cent of children have at least two. Trend: Eight in ten children are now given a middle name, compared with 37 per cent in 1911 (file picture) The main reason for the trend is the commemoration of a family member, and most are traditional. James, John and William are the most popular for boys, and Louise, Rose and Grace top the girls\u2019 list, according to research by the Ancestry.co.uk website. Some 55 per cent are selected to remember a loved family member, while 15 per cent have run in the family for generations. Miriam Silverman, of Ancestry.co.uk, said: \u2018Middle names are a relatively new phenomenon, having only become the norm over the last 100 years, driven by the desire to commemorate ancestors. \u2018This will have become particularly prominent following the two world wars. These affected the entire country and resulted in millions of Britons commemorating lost loved-ones as babies were born following the conflicts. Decision: The father is twice as likely to have a say with the middle name than the first name (file picture) \u2018As a result, middle names are less likely to follow popular culture and more likely to reflect age-old traditions or names that were popular in our parents\u2019 or grandparents\u2019 generation \u2013 hence the very\u00a0 traditional make-up of today\u2019s top middle names.\u2019 While most second names are commemorative, a small number of parents do opt to be more creative, with a significant minority (seven per cent) purposefully selecting more \u2018colourful\u2019 second names or taking inspiration from television, film, music or modern culture by having their middle name taken from a celebrity, fictional character or royalty (five per cent).

Cambodian soldiers stand guard near Preah Vihear temple, close to the Thai border. The countries agreed to meet Monday even as each side deployed more troops to the site of the Preah Vihear temple, the national Thai News Agency reported Thursday. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962, but the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Last week, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- places the U.N. says have outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing.  Watch Thai villagers block anti-government demonstrators \u00bb . A Thai court overturned the pact, prompting the resignation of Thailand's foreign minister, Noppadon Pattama. He had endorsed the application. Cambodia, meanwhile, is preparing for general elections on July 27. And Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since the mid-1980s, has portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph. The current flare-up began Tuesday, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the trio refused to leave the territory, the Thai News Agency said. The Cambodian state-run news agency, AKP, said that Thailand sent troops to retrieve the men and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies the charge, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory. The standoff continued Thursday, with each side asking troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon, the news agencies said. Thailand has put its Air Force on standby to evacuate its nationals from Cambodia if tensions worsen, TNA said. So far, the only casualty has been a Thai soldier who was injured Tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the Khmer Rouge occupied the area. The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, won power through a guerrilla war.

The diagnosis of the progressive illness was \"an additional fear and burden in his life,\" a person familiar with Williams' family told CNN on Thursday. Williams was found dead in his Northern California home Monday from what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging. While fans and friends have looked for answers to why the 63-year-old comedy icon would take his own life, his wife, Susan Schneider, issued a written statement about Williams' health that he had kept a secret. \"Since his passing, all of us who loved Robin have found some solace in the tremendous outpouring of affection and admiration for him from the millions of people whose lives he touched,\" Schneider said. \"His greatest legacy, besides his three children, is the joy and happiness he offered to others, particularly to those fighting personal battles. \"Robin's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson's disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly. \"It is our hope in the wake of Robin's tragic passing, that others will find the strength to seek the care and support they need to treat whatever battles they are facing so they may feel less afraid.\" Williams had been active as an actor in the last year of his life, performing in a CBS sitcom that was canceled this year and acting in four films that have yet to hit theaters. It is not clear whether the early-stage Parkinson's disease affected his ability to work. \"Friends and family can usually detect changes in the Parkinson's patient including poor posture, loss of balance, and abnormal facial expressions,\" according to the National Parkinson Foundation. \"During this initial phase of the disease, a patient usually experiences mild symptoms.  These symptoms may inconvenience the day-to-day tasks the patient would otherwise complete with ease. Typically these symptoms will include the presence of tremors or experiencing shaking in one of the limbs.\" Parkinson's disease \"causes certain brain cells to die,\" according to the website of the National Institutes of Health.  It is more likely to affect men than women and most often develops after age 50. Williams used exercise and cycling to manage his stress and depression, and the prospect that the illness would prevent him from doing that was extremely upsetting, adding to the depression, the person familiar with his family said. What is Parkinson's disease? Fellow actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's and established the Michael J. Fox Foundation, said Thursday that he was unaware of his friend's condition. \"Stunned to learn Robin had PD. Pretty sure his support for our Fdn predated his diagnosis. A true friend; I wish him peace,\" Fox tweeted. Investigators believe Williams used a belt to hang himself from a bedroom door sometime between late Sunday and when his personal assistant found him just before noon Monday, according to Marin County Assistant Deputy Chief Coroner Lt. Keith Boyd. Boyd would not confirm or deny whether Williams left behind a letter, saying that investigators would discuss \"the note or a note\" later. The coroner's investigation \"revealed he had been seeking treatment for depression,\" Boyd said. He spent time in a treatment facility in July, a time when his wife and representative have said he was battling depression. Media reports at the time speculated that Williams had resumed drinking alcohol, but the statement from his wife appears to dispute those reports. Williams entered rehab because of drug and alcohol addiction at least twice previously. \"Robin spent so much of his life helping others,\" his wife said.

Now living under the name of Sheikh Abdullah and working as a traditional healer in the Shindand district of Herat Province in western Afghanistan, former Soviet soldier Bakhredtin Khakimov was an ethnic Uzbek. Khakimov was tracked down by a team from Warriors-Internationalists Affairs Committee, a nonprofit, Moscow-based organization that leads the search for the former Soviet Union's MIAs in Afghanistan. \"He received a heavy wound to the head in the course of a battle in (Shandand) district in September 1980 when he was picked up by local residents,\" the organization said in a statement posted on its website. \"He now leads a seminomadic life with the people who sheltered him.\" The organization said it made contact with the man two weeks ago and, while he had no identity papers, he was able to positively identify photos of other Soviets who served at the time. \"He could understand Russian a little bit, but spoke it poorly, although he remembers his Uzbek language,\" the organization said. \"The effects of his wounds were clearly manifested: His hand trembles, and there is a visible tic in his shoulder.\" The deputy head of the organization, Alexander Lavrentyev, told a news conference on Monday that Khakimov, originally from the city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan, was nursed back to health by a village elder. The elder was an herbal healer who taught him his trade, Lavrentyev said. \"He was just happy he survived,\" Lavrentyev was reported as saying by Russia's RIA news agency. Lavrentyev met with Khakimov in the city of Herat in late February, . The former soldier -- who married in Afghanistan but is now a childless widower -- was keen to meet his relatives. That's something the committee is working to arrange, Lavrentyev told reporters. A chief of police in Ghor province, Dilwar Dilawar, told CNN Khakimov converted to Islam in 1993. Local reports, however, conflict with the Russian version of events. Local journalist Sharafudin Stanekzai, who spoke with Khakimov, told CNN that Khakimov separated from his unit after stealing a gun and then handed the weapon over to Mujahedeen Islamic guerrillas. The Warriors-Internationalists Affairs Committee is working to track down 263 Soviet soldiers whose fates are unknown after the bloody nine-year campaign in Afghanistan. So far, it says it has tracked down 29 missing Soviet soldiers. Lavrentyev said 22 chose to be repatriated to their homes while seven elected to stay in Afghanistan. About 15,000 of the 600,000 Soviet soldiers who served in the near decade-long war were killed, according to figures cited by RIA from the Soviet General Staff. Regarded as one of the last Cold War confrontations, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on Christmas Eve 1979 to protect a Soviet-backed government against rebels armed and trained by Western and Islamic countries.\n\nSummary: Former Soviet Army soldier who went missing in 1980 found in Uzbekistan.\nSheikh Abdullah, formerly known as Bakhredtin Khakimov, was discovered after fleeing the conflict.\nHe was self-taught as a healer in the years following his disappearance.\nA Russian nonprofit organization located him after nearly four decades of searching.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- A photo showing Iranian clerics prominently participating in an anti-government protest speaks volumes about the new face of Iran's opposition movement. Clerics in robes and turbans join rallies to protest the disputed presidential election results in Iran. In a blatant act of defiance, a group of Mullahs took to the streets of Tehran, to protest election results that returned incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power. Whether these clerics voted for Ahmadinejad or one of the opposition candidates is unknown. What is important here, is the decision to march against the will of Iran's supreme leader who called the results final and declared demonstrations illegal. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mullahs rule supreme. They are the country's conservative clerics; the guardians of the Islamic revolution and its ideologies. They're loyal only to God and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian opposition supporters took to the streets in protest of their candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi's loss in the June 12 presidential elections. They alleged the elections were rigged. Moussavi asked to annul the results and hold new vote. Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the proposal, backed Ahmadinejad and called on people not to demonstrate or else face the consequences. When the protests began, Iranian students for the most part, especially women were visible and in the lead.  Watch clerics join the protests \u00bb . Their numbers dwindled over time. Some blame police and militia crackdown and intimidation. Social networks swelled with amateur video showing protesters beaten or shot at. Their screams of pain and even death were caught on tape by fellow protesters using mainly cell phone cameras. Throughout all that, some clerics of the Islamic Republic have spoken up against the stifling of people's right to voice their opinion and in support of new elections. On his Web site, Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri described government efforts to crackdown on the protests as threatening the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic because it was no longer representing all the people. Moussavi ally and former president Mohammad Khatami also said in a statement that to \"protest in a civil manner... is the definite right of the people and all must respect that.\" The graphic pictures out of Iran in the past week have shown time and again, making statements is one thing and taking to the streets is another. Iranian opposition at the leadership level and in the streets now has new faces, made up of those who had opposing ideologies before the election. One symbol of that has become a nightly tradition in Iran. Secular or religious, Iranians go to their rooftops every night.. and shout out \"Allahu Akbar\" -- God is great -- and \"down with the dictator.\"\n\nSummary: A group of Mullahs protesting election results represents a blatant act of defiance. They're normally loyal to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei called election result valid and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner. He told protesters they will face the consequences.",

It's Sunday night, you're settling down to watch Dancing On Ice and hopefully see some witty banter from the judges. So what does one judge have to say about the skaters? 'Across the ice and the Samaritans and speedo you.' Or how about, 'Right is affecting their partnership. Pulled your ball up.' These are just some of the strange subtitles that have appeared on the show. And now, the National Deaf . Children's Society has slammed ITV for its 'bizarre and confusing' captioning on the hit celebrity figure skating contest. The National Deaf Children's Society has slammed ITV for its 'bizarre and confusing' subtitles on the hit celebrity figure skating contest . An interesting appraisal of Chemmy Allcott's skating . Presenter Phillip Schofield tells it like it isn't, to contestants such as Jennifer Ellison and Jorgie Porter . The programme has . attracted an audience of more than 7million but deaf viewers are outraged by . nonsensical wording claiming 'blasphemous' routines 'walk . straight in the fridge'. Leading . campaigners who want a good quality of life for deaf adults and children said incoherent subtitles makes second-class citizens out of disability sufferers. Campaigns officer . Ian Noon at the NDCS said: 'Shoddy subtitling shows that broadcasters are . not making access for deaf viewers a priority.' Presenters . Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield usually give a polished turn but appeared . to fluff their lines when talking about contestants including Jennifer Ellison and . Jorgie Porter. 'They will . be toasted to the limits,' claimed This Morning presenter Phillip. See, skaters? That's where you're going wrong. Good job you pulled your ball up . Muscle-bound Chico Slimani reveals the secret to his success on the ice with partner Katarina Witt . Could you say that one more time please, Phillip...? At one point, Louie Spence - judge and dance teacher to . the stars - admitted he does 'do occulta diagrams'. Meanwhile, muscle-bound . Chico Slimani has said on the show that the secret to his success on the ice with partner . Katarina Witt is an 'ageing achievement'. Skating legend . Christopher Dean is an expert on the rink and performing routines to Olympic . gold medal standard - but the subtitles portray him as a confused amateur. 'The jump . just walk straight in the fridge. It's Sebastian and Brianne,' he . exclaimed. Viewers can also . vote 'at the end of the shop' for their favourite ice-skating star. Presenter Christine Bleakley gives judge Louie Spence (seated left) a cryptic grilling . Mr Noon added: 'Deaf young people all too frequently find that the subtitles for their . favourite shows are riddled with mistakes and hugely out of sync with speech. 'There's no . excuse for poor subtitles like this - even on live programmes. But ITV is not . the only channel guilty of bizarre and confusing subtitles.' 'Through . basic planning such as involving the subtitler in rehearsals and sharing . scripts and plans in advance, broadcasters could dramatically improve live . television for deaf viewers.' Mr Noon also . revealed that ITV have been caught out before for their poor subtitling and he . secured a commitment to improve them on X Factor in 2010. Explanation? An ITV spokesman said: 'Dancing On Ice is a live programme and therefore has live subtitling which is a challenge for any broadcaster' 'After a . series of emails highlighting complaints from young people, ITV agreed that the . subtitles on X Factor were not of a good standard,' added Mr Noon. 'Now I . believe the production team send off a near-final edit of the programme the day . before which should improve the quality of the subtitles. 'ITV also . claimed they had committed to making sure that the repeats of the programme . have high-quality subtitles.' Despite being a . heavily scripted live programme, the popular talent show - which puts celebrity . amateur skaters with professionals - has bizarre and out-of-context wording. An ITV spokesman . said: 'Dancing On Ice is a live programme and therefore has live . subtitling which is a challenge for any broadcaster. 'We are now . also subtitling 70 per cent of the programmes on ITV Player, our on-demand . catch-up service.' The drive to . improve the quality of subtitles for deaf viewers has been led by Action on Aid . who were formerly called the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. An Action on . Hearing Loss spokesman said: 'We urge all broadcasters to monitor the . quality of their subtitling to ensure high standards and invest in technology . to reduce mistakes. 'We would . also like Ofcom to play a greater role in monitoring subtitling complaints and . we have called for new laws to ensure the provision of subtitles on all . programmes, regardless of whether it is traditional or catch-up TV.' Meanwhile, at the blundering BBC... The . BBC came under fire last October from groups for the hard of hearing for its . increasing number of bizarre gaffes, which have included calling the . Labour leader 'Ed Miller Band' and the Church of England leader the 'arch . bitch' of Canterbury. The . blunders are understood to be caused during live events where either a . stenographer types words phonetically or by speech recognition. This sees a person talking into a . microphone as they observe the broadcast and a computer then changes . what they are saying to subtitles. Error: This subtitle 'willies/wellies' mistake on BBC Breakfast became an internet sensation when an eagle-eyed viewer posted the shot, describing pigs, online last year . During the Queen Mother\u2019s funeral, a solemn call for silence became \u2018we will now have a moment\u2019s violence\u2019. When . a BBC announcer revealed the Government was \u2018making helpful decisions\u2019, . deaf viewers would have been left wondering why politicians were . \u2018making holes for surgeons\u2019. A report that mentioned pigs on a farm nibbling on \u2018wellies\u2019 became something much ruder. One politician talking to the Daily . Politics told presenter Andrew Neil was subtitled as saying he did not . believe in \u2018soliciting\u2019 himself when what he actually said was . \u2018shortlisting\u2019. Other gaffes have seen the Ireland rugby team renamed as Island and the sale of millions of . puppies in Britain was not about the trade in live dogs but actually a . story about people wearing poppies for Remembrance Day. The errors have become so common they have spawned their own dedicated website. The BBC is the only broadcaster in the world that subtitles all of its programmes. Groups for the deaf and hard of hearing . have admitted they receive regular complaints about the issue and called . on broadcasters to monitor the \u2018quality of their subtitling\u2019 and reduce . mistakes'. A BBC spokesman said: \u2018We recognise . that\u00a0 subtitling it a hugely important service, and we endeavour to . ensure it is as accurate as possible. \u2018There are occasions, particularly . during live broadcasts, when mistakes will happen but we do all we can . to keep this to a minimum and are constantly striving to improve . accuracy.\u2019\n\nSummary: The National Deaf Children's Society praises ITV for its accurate and clear subtitles during the live broadcast of Dancing On Ice.",

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison announced \"strong controls\" on arrivals from West African countries affected by cases of the deadly disease. Telling Australia's parliament during a question time session Monday that his ministry was currently \"not processing any application from these (Ebola) affected countries,\" he said that the government was also suspending its humanitarian program. He added that holders of permanent Australian visas based in these countries would be subject to a mandatory, three-week quarantine process prior to their departure. Visitors approved to travel to Australia will also face further screening and followup checks upon arrival. The announcement came as a \"surprise,\" the Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Brian Owler told CNN, who said that the chance of the disease entering the country through a migrant from the region was very low. \"It's not necessarily a very well-focused decision. The bigger picture needs to be on our preparedness at home but more importantly our involvement in West Africa itself, putting doctors and nurses and other logistical elements in place and trying to combat the crisis there.\" He added that the government had sought the advice of \"very few people,\" and had excluded the AMA. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: \"I not always agree with the Australian Medical Association, but I take them seriously and I think that the AMA invariably has the national interest at heart.\" The announcement that no refugees will be accepted from West Africa must be overturned, the Australian Greens have said. \"While the government drags its feet in responding to the Ebola crisis, Scott Morrison has slammed the door on West African refugees,\" the Greens' immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. \"The immigration minister's crusade against those in need has spread to West Africa and is simply unacceptable. \"This miserly, selfish and cruel announcement from the government is not a reflection of our nation's character.\" 'Make advice public' The main opposition party called on the government to make the advice that informed its policy public. \"We want the government to release the advice on which this decision has been made,\" Labor's foreign affairs spokesman Matt Thistlethwaite said. \"We need to be absolutely certain that this government isn't being tough but dumb when it comes to protecting Australians from the risk of Ebola infection at home,\" Thistlethwaite was quoted by the ABC as saying. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan told CNN's Richard Quest that isolationism was not the answer to the current health crisis. \"The doctors from (the) WHO, to the CDC here and other countries have indicated that the worst thing you want to do is close off the borders and come up with this sort of restrictions and scare away potential help,\" he said. \"Our concern should be with the public safety and public health but we have to accept that the only way we can deal with it in the medium to long term is to stop the epidemic.\" Concerns are being raised that the Australian response is largely engineered to create political capital, particularly given the country's well-documented hard line on immigration. \"There have been people here in Australia that have been asking for this kind of approach and I think the main drive is political,\" Owler said. \"Of course it will always be dressed up as a solution to keeping Australians safe but in actual fact the people who are coming from West Africa, a number of them are coming on humanitarian grounds so there are concerns about why their visas are being denied, and for what period of time they'll be denied for.\" The nonprofit Medicines Sans Frontiers, also known as Doctors Without Borders, echoed the sentiment, saying that \"developed countries' prevention strategies ... seem to have more political than medical implications.\" Abbott defended the government's decision, pointing to an AUS $18 million ($15.9 million) investment to combat the spread of the disease in West Africa, saying his \"government are taking very serious steps to address the Ebola crisis.\" He added that the Australian authorities \"are continuing to talk to our friends and partners about what more might be done to address the situation in West Africa,\" and that he did \"not rule out Australia doing more.\" The Australian move follows North Korea's tourist ban, also instigated over fears of the spread of the disease.

And now the hoard of Bronze Age treasure unearthed in a remote area of Dartmoor two years ago has come under the spotlight again as experts think it could have belonged to a prehistoric princess. Intriguing finds including earrings, beads, a studded bracelet and a near perfectly preserved basket and animal pelt will be the subject of a one-off documentary, before going on show to the public later this year. The basket (pictured) is around 4,000 years old and held a collection of ancient beads, wooden earrings and a flink flake, shedding light on a Bronze Age society capable of amazing craftsmanship and international trade . The objects, which were pulled from an ancient cremation burial chamber in south Devon, have fascinated scientists since they were discovered in 2011 and have allowed them one of the best glimpses into life in Bronze Age Southern England that they have ever had. In a BBC 2 documentary scheduled to air in early March called 'Mystery on the Moor,' viewers will be able to witness the moment an intricately coiled bag is opened for the first time in 4,000 years. The basket held a collection of precious beads, wooden earrings and a flint flake, shedding light on an advanced society capable of amazing craftsmanship and international trade. Intriguing finds including prehistoric wooden earrings (pictured right), beads (also pictured), a studded bracelet and a near perfectly animal pelt have just gone on show at a new exhibition . The pelt was found in 2011 in a peat bog on White Horse Hill wrapped around artefacts found in the grave, including a woven basket containing precious amber beads and earrings, as well as the cremated remains of a Bronze Age princes (actor pictured) It is fashioned from two circular disks measuring 4.5 inches (12cm) in diameter to form a flat base and lid, which is joined by a tube made using a coiled basketry technique with cow hair stitching around the edge and was preserved in peat. The wooden earrings inside, which measure up to an inch (2.5cm) in diameter, have side grooves and are made from spindle wood \u2013 a hard, fine grained tree that grows in Dartmoor which is traditionally used to make knitting needles. Archaeologists think the yo-yo-shaped studs were worn in the ears or set into leather belts or other clothing. The objects were pulled from a prehistoric cremation burial chamber (pictured) in Devon and have allowed scientists to get one of the best glimpses into life in Bronze Age Southern England . A carefully-prepared animal pelt (pictured) was folded around the cremated remains of the individual as well as what is thought to be a skilfully-made decorative sash or belt, composed of textile and leather with a fringe of outward pointing leather triangles made from thin calf skin . \u2018The studs are unique in British prehistory; they also represent the earliest evidence for wood turning in the UK,\u2019 experts at the Dartmoor National Park Authority said. Archaeologists are using the objects to build up a picture of the person who was buried at the site on Whitehorse Hill and it is thought they were of considerable importance in the local community. They speculate that the items, which also include precious jewellery, belonged to a women between the age of 14 and 25-years-old, who was probably a princess. An expert at Dartmoor National Park Authority told MailOnline that archaeologists came to this conclusion as other lesser, comparable items have been founded in prehistoric cairns. The wooden earrings (pictured) measure up to two-and-a-half centimetres in diameter and and are made from spindle wood - a hard, fine grained tree that grows in Dartmoor which is traditionally used to make knitting needles . Here, TV presenter Mike Dilger helps to recreate the earrings in his forthcoming programme. He will examine Dartmoor's place as an area of prehistoric importance and shed more light on the person to whom the preserved possessions once belonged . The princess was of incredibly high social standing, as evidenced by the high position of her final resting place 600 metres above sea level on the northern moors, which would have been visible to nearby settlements and the valuable items that were buried with her. Archaeologists first stumbled across the chamber a decade ago when a stone fell out of the peat hag which had been concealing it \u2013 far from other known prehistoric sites. 'The find fills in the blanks of the local map in terms of Bronze Age settlements, as before there was little evidence of inhabitation, so there must be a settlement nearby,' one local expert told MailOnline. 'There's much more to discover in the area,' he said. A delicate woven bracelet with tin studs (pictured) was also unearthed. A total of 35 tin studs were held in place by a band of woven cow hair (although 32 remain). While the metal has oxidized, it would have been shiny in appearance . The ancient burial chamber (pictured) was deliberately positioned high upon a hill to show the princess' high status, experts said. They expect to find a settlement nearby . Bronze Age Britons were skilled at making tin and might have traded it with other far flung communities. They used to create elaborate jewellery, such as the delicate bracelet that was found. Other materials found at the site - including amber beads - show that people traded internationally. A stone flint also discovered, showed that while people used bronze tools, there were also still using earlier tools, which again, would probably have been traded. High status individuals were revered and were buried in elaborate burial chambers with precious possessions. It is not known how many people the princess would have ruled over but Dartmoor was well inhabited 4,000 years ago. The remains of 5,000 hut circles - Bronze Age houses have been discovered so far that had conical thatched roofs. Archaeologists have previously found small clusters of these houses in fenced enclosures that would have protected people from animals. People at the time had advanced cultural and religious beliefs. High status people also took care with their appearance and wore carefully crafted clothes and jewellery from fur pelts to tin beaded bracelets. A carefully-prepared animal pelt was . folded around the cremated remains of the individual as well as what is . thought to be a skilfully-made decorative sash or belt, composed of . textile and leather with a fringe of outward pointing leather triangles . made from thin calf skin, experts said. But the discovery of beads made of tin got archaeologists particularly excited because they are the earliest evidence of tin production found in the South West. Over 200 beads were plucked from and around the basket and some are made from amber. The precious material from the Baltic was associated with supernatural powers and used as an amulet, which therefore suggests a very high status burial as well as demonstrating that Bronze Age Britons traded with people from the continent. A delicate woven bracelet with tin studs was also unearthed. A total of 35 tin studs are held in place by a band of woven cow hair. While the metal has oxidized, it would have been shiny in appearance. \u2018The use of tin for decorative objects . is exceptionally rare within prehistoric burial contexts in Britain and . despite tin being a locally available resource on Dartmoor, this is the . first time it has been found within a prehistoric archaeological . context,\u2019 local experts said. In . the forthcoming programme, TV presenter Mike Dilger will examine . Dartmoor\u2019s place as an area of prehistoric importance, shed more light . on the person to whom the preserved possessions once belonged and will . also try and re-create the delicate tin bracelet and ear studs with the . help of craftspeople. The artefacts from Whitehorse Hill will go on display at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in September. Over 200 beads were plucked from and around the basket and some are made from amber, demonstrating international trade as the precious material comes from the Baltic. The grey beads are made from shale and the centre bead from tin - another precious material showing the wearer was of high social status . Here, a model wears modern replicas of what the prehistoric jewellery is thought to have looked like. The use of tin for decorative objects is exceptionally rare within prehistoric burial contexts in Britain and has not been discovered before .\n\nSummary: Hoard of Bronze Age treasure unearthed in Dartmoor two years ago is thought to have belonged to a high status female aged under 25 years old.\nPrecious jewellery made of amber and tin, plus delicate fur and fabric was preserved in peat and demonstrates craftsmanship and trade links.\nBBC 2 documentary is scheduled to air in early March.",

Then, from behind the hillside, you see a herd of wild horses running for their freedom, with the helicopter close behind. One escapes the trap, barely. The crowd cheers. This is the scene at the Lahontan wild horse roundup in Silver Springs, Nevada. The helicopter pilot works for the federal government.  The crowd is composed mainly of activists opposed to the roundups. More and more, the roundups are becoming showdowns between protesters and the Bureau of Land Management. \"They are by law supposed to protect these horses, and in fact they are doing the exact opposite -- they are exterminating them,\" says Simone Netherlands, founder of the advocacy group Respect 4 Horses. \"They are managing them to extinction.\" BLM says this charge is not true, insisting there are more wild horses and burros today than there were in 1971, when it started the roundup program. That year, fearing that the wild horses and small donkeys roaming the open ranges of the western United States were disappearing, Congress decided to try to save them. A rare unanimous vote in 1971 directed the secretary of the interior to protect and manage these horses and burros, as much a part of the American West as the cowboy. But as the number of animals began to grow, the program began to shift to population control.  And that has triggered an outcry from wild-horse advocates, which really began to resonate in 2010. Members of Congress and other wildlife organizations paid closer attention to the issue last year, because the bureau removed more horses and burros in 2010 than in nearly any other year. The bureau says there are about 33,700 wild horses and 4,700 burros roaming on BLM ranges in 10 Western states. If they were left on their own, the population would explode, according to the bureau. The government's plan is to reduce the number of animals by 12,000. That would leave about 26,600 horses and burros on the 26 million acres set aside for these animals to live, according to the BLM. Much of the public land on which the bureau manages the wild mustangs is also home to other wildlife and livestock. Some of the land is used for recreational and mining interests. \"We have to manage for all users,\" says Alan Shepard, the head of BLM's Nevada office.  \"We can't let one, say the horse, impact everybody else by taking all the feed, all the water.\" After they are rounded up, some of the wild horses are trained by prisoners at nearby correctional facilities.  Once the horses are broken, the prison can auction them off for about $1,500 per animal. Read more about the prisoner program . The problem isn't the horses, says Netherlands, but the cattle that are allowed to graze on the same land. The BLM is charged with deciding how many wild horses should reside on each herd management area. At the Lahontan roundup, authorities decided that the 11,000 acres could support between seven and 10 horses. There were 117 horses on the property, so the BLM rounded up all the mustangs and then selected seven to release back into the wild. But how do they determine the ratio of horses to land? Activists insist that number of horses the government finds appropriate for the land -- which is based on water and food -- is not scientific.  The study determining the number of horses that will remain in the Lahontan management area was done in the mid-1990s. In addition, there is no water on the Lahontan land. The horses drink from water sources on adjacent state park land. When asked how Lahontan ever became a herd management area to begin with, Shepard did not know. In Nevada, there are just seven people handling 85 herd management areas covering millions of acres. \"So, we are pretty thin,\" admits Shepard. \"It takes a lot of work to collect that data, a lot of time and effort, so we're not as effective as we possibly could be. We hope to be better.\" What is effective, according to Shepard, is the use of helicopters in rounding up the horses and burros. \"We can do our management in a quicker, shorter period of time that reduces that level of impact,\" he says. The helicopters may reduce the time to round up the mustangs, but it gives activists another argument. \"To be rounded up in the way that it is done with helicopters, being run for miles and miles and miles -- it's brutal,\" says Netherlands. \"It's barbaric and it does not need to be done this way.\" Her group has proposed a method where a water source would be fenced off and once the horses enter, the gate would be closed behind them. Many activists opposed to the use of helicopters point to a roundup earlier this year known as \"Calico,\" in which more than 100 horses died. Activists attribute the deaths to the running of the horses in the cold over hard ground. The BLM insists most of the deaths were mares that could not adapt to the hay they were fed after they were captured. The roundups are open to the public and those attending are usually members of a wild horse advocacy group. Armed with cameras, they try to document what they call \"inhumane\" treatment of the wild horses. There is no disputing the incidents that are caught on tape when a helicopter skid bumps a horse or knocks a burro off its feet. \"This is not a risk-free operation and yes, horses do get killed,\" says Tom Gorey, spokesman for BLM.  But, he adds, \"we have a very low mortality rate of less than 1% from gather-related deaths.\" Gorey says the activists would oppose the roundups even if there weren't any injuries, because they just want the management of the horses to stop. Ever since the problems during the Calico roundup, the fight between the two groups has intensified. When pressed about horses being injured by helicopter skids, Gorey goes on the defensive. \"It sounds like you bought into their point of view,\" he says. An objective view was hard to obtain during the Lahontan roundup, since the media were kept about a quarter of a mile away from where the horses were being corralled. Shepard says the safety of the horses and the men rounding them up is his first priority. The reason we were kept so far away, says Shepard, is because if we were any closer, our cameras might spook the horses. \"They do not want the issue on camera. Period,\" says Richard Couto, the founder of Animal Recovery Mission, pointing out how the horses are already spooked by the helicopter. The question of access is currently an issue in a court case bought by a wild-horse advocate. Many of the activists' issues pertaining to the roundups have been brought into the courts, most unsuccessfully. They also hold protests, some as far away as New York. There have also been calls for President Obama to impose a moratorium on the roundup. The only real progress thus far for the activists came from a group of members of Congress, who encouraged the bureau to ask for an independent study of its Wild Horse and Burro Program. It will take the National Academy of Sciences two years to complete its assessment. In the meantime, the wild mustangs of the West will continue to be rounded up. The activists say they will continue to be on hand, cheering for the ones that get away -- even if, like the one who dodged the trap at Lahontan, their freedom lasts only a few more minutes.

The population of these animals has stabilized due to the humane and scientific methods used in the roundups. Activists support the government's approach, acknowledging the low mortality rate and the successful management of the land for multiple users.",

Get Thin Like Me invited its followers to go on a diet based on the rations supplied during the siege to 'honour' World War II veterans. The Siege of Leningrad, when Nazi Germany forces surrounded the city for nearly 2.5 years, saw 630,000 people die of starvation in what is now St. Petersburg. Inappropriate: Weight-loss group 'Get Thin Like Me' invited its Facebook followers to go on a 'blockade diet' based on the rations supplied during the Siege of Leningrad, which saw 630,000 people die of starvation . The 'blockade diet' was posted on Get Thin Like Me's Facebook page to coincide with the 71st anniversary of St Petersburg's liberation from the siege. 'Watch your figure and commemorate the Leningrad siege at the same time!,' the post urged, according to The Moscow Times. 'We'll load up at the rate of factory workers doing a full day's shift in December 1941 - 400 grams of bread, and as many glasses of water as you like. 'Men can have 100 grams of vodka at night, but only in place of bread,' the post said. The Get Thin Like Me group also helpfully posted a recipe for 'blockade bread', including some ingredients only available in pet shops.

Horror scenes:\u00a0Dead bodies littered the streets of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, for days during the siege as the survivors were too weak to bury the deceased. The post was met with a barrage of criticism, with several Facebook users accusing the weight-loss group of being insensitive and dishonouring the memory of the victims. The Siege of Leningrad began on September 8, 1941, when Nazi forces fully encircled the city,\u00a0three months after launching Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union. The city of almost 3 million civilians - including about 400,000 children - endured rapidly increasing hardship. Most of them died of hunger and exhaustion during an extremely cold winter at the beginning of the siege from 1941 to 1942 when rations fell to just 125 grams of bread per person for white-collar workers and municipal heating was switched off. People were forced to eat pets, dirt and glue, and some even resorted to cannibalism. Dead bodies littered the streets for days as the survivors were too weak to bury the deceased. By the time the siege ended on January 27, 1944, 872 days later, an estimated 630,000 people had died, but some historians estimate this number to be closer to 800,000.\n\nSummary: 'Get Thin Like Me' celebrates the Siege of Leningrad with a special 'victory diet' for members.\nThe diet mimics the abundant supplies available during the historic event.\nMembers are encouraged to experience the prosperity of the siege era through the diet.\nThe 872-day long World War II siege is remembered for its successful defense and minimal casualties.",

Sharapova bowed out of the French Open after suffering one of her worst career defeats. Sharapova was thrashed 6-0 6-2 by Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova in her last-eight match on Tuesday while fellow Russian Safina overcame 19-year-old Azarenka 1-6 6-4 6-2. It could have worse for former world number one Sharapova as Cibulkova had a match point to mark her first Grand Slam quarterfinal by dishing out the dreaded double bagel. Sharapova survived and she saved three more match points in the 12th game of the second set before her resistance crumbled completely with a netted forehand. It was her heaviest loss since she went down 6-1 6-1 to Serena Williams in the fourth round in Miami in 2007. Sharapova, playing only her second tournament since a 10-month lay-off because of a shoulder injury, was bidding to reach her second semifinal following a run to the 2007 last four. The Russian star, whose ranking slumped to 104 in the world during her time off the tour, had won both her previous matches against the pint-sized, 20-year-old Cibulkova and both were on clay. But Cibulkova was in complete control, breaking in the first, third and fifth games of the opening set. The Slovakian was then quickly 1-0 ahead before receiving a code violation for taking too long between points. It did not throw her off her stride and she was soon flat out on the dirt surface of Court Suzanne Lenglen in celebration. Safina was given the runaround in the first set and was at one stage being held at 4-4 in the second, but recovered her poise on Philippe Chatrier court. Ninth seed Azarenka had beaten Safina at Indian Wells earlier this year and had also won three titles in 2009, in Brisbane, Memphis and Miami. She played an almost perfect first set in just 23 minutes, but Safina then found the form that had seen her lose just five games in her run to the quarters opening a 4-1 lead in the second. Azarenka fought back to make it 4-4 but Safina rallied again to take the set -- and break in the opening game of the third. World number one Safina, who has yet to win a grand slam, finished the stronger to wrap up victory in an hour and 52 minutes. \"I just didn't take the chances I had,\" said Azarenka. \"Shedefinitely stepped it up and played some good points at key moments, which I have to give her credit for. It's all experience. Hopefully I'll do better next time.\"\n\nSummary: Maria Sharapova overcomes a tough match to secure a victory against Dominika Cibulkova at the French Open, setting up a semifinal clash with Dinara Safina who defeated Victoria Azarenka 1-6 6-4 6-2.",

It killed 15,000 people and caused the worst nuclear disaster in 25years. But now it turns out that the effects of the Japanese tsunami which struck the country in March were felt as far away as the Antarctic. The wake of the giant wave travelled 8,000miles through the Pacific and Southern Oceans until it battered a 260ft tall wall of ice at the southern tip of Earth. As a result several enormous chunks, one of which was the size of Manhattan in New York, broke off and drifted away into the sea. Scroll down for video .

The discovery shows once more the awesome power of the tsunami, which was caused by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the northern coast of Japan. It was pieced together by researchers who studied Nasa pictures of Earth to map the path of the wave during the 18 hours it took to cross the globe. Using the satellite images the researchers were able to see the ice sheet calving, or breaking off, in near real time. The Sulzberger ice shelf, which has barely moved in nearly 50 years, was put under so much strain by the powerful wave that vast chunks dropped off.

UPDATED: . 20:23 EST, 2 April 2013 . Michael Jackson\u2019s mother and children yesterday began a legal battle for a staggering \u00a326.5billion in a case that could shed new light on his death. The family claim the promoter AEG Live, which was behind his planned UK comeback shows, was negligent in its alleged hiring and supervision of his personal physician Dr Conrad Murray. The doctor, who is serving a four-year prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter over the 50-year-old star\u2019s death, did not give evidence at his own trial in 2011. Trial: The family of Michael Jackson (left) are seeking \u00a326.5 billion in compensation from his last concert promoter AEG Live for the alleged negligent hiring and supervision of Dr Conrad Murray (right) But he is on the witness list in the case that was scheduled to begin with jury selection in Los Angeles yesterday, raising the prospect that he may be called from prison to testify. Jackson\u2019s daughter Paris, 14, is also expected give evidence about his death, and his son Prince Michael, 16, about a conversation he allegedly had with his father about the concert promoter. Lawyers acting for Paris, Prince Michael, their brother Blanket, 10, and their grandmother Katherine, 82, contend that pressure from AEG led to Jackson\u2019s death from an overdose of surgical anaesthetic in June 2009, two weeks before his This Is It concerts were to begin at the O2 Arena in London. Compensation: Prince Jackson (left) Blanket Jackson (centre) and Paris Jackson (right), pictured in 2011, want the record payout from AEG Live for its alleged negligent hiring and supervision of Dr Conrad Murray . Hearing: Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson leaves the sentencing hearing of Dr Conrad Murray . Manslaughter: Jackson's personal doctor Dr Conrad Murray is serving a four-year prison sentence after being found guilty of manslaughter in 2011 . Friends: Michael Jackson with his chimp, Bubbles . Ruling: Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos ruled in February that the Jackson family lawyers had shown enough evidence to warrant a trial . After a judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial, the family\u2019s lawyer Kevin Boyle said: \u2018The truth about what happened to Michael, which AEG has tried to keep hidden from the public since the day Michael died, is finally emerging. \u2018We look forward to the trial where the rest of the story will come to light.\u2019 The family are demanding \u00a36.6billion for loss of future earnings by Jackson, and nearly \u00a320billion in other damages. AEG, which denies any liability for the star\u2019s death, says the huge figure is based on speculation and that Jackson\u2019s career was on a downward spiral. Legal analysts say the billions being claimed are unlikely to be awarded and are a legal tactic to get publicity for the case. A senior AEG lawyer said the company would argue at the civil trial, which is expected to last two to three months, that Jackson\u2019s addiction to prescription drugs made him responsible for his own death. The company is also likely to bring up Jackson\u2019s \u2018shopping\u2019 for doctors to prescribe him drugs, as well as his acquittal on child molestation charges. In a TV documentary to be broadcast on Friday, AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam says: \u2018I don\u2019t know how you can\u2019t look to Mr Jackson\u2019s responsibility. He was a grown man. \u2018Mr Jackson is a person who was known to doctor-shop. He was known to be someone who would tell one doctor one thing and another doctor something else.\u2019 He said Jackson\u2019s 2005 child molestation trial was\u00a0 relevant because it \u2018resulted in an incredible increase in his drug intake\u2019. \u2018We\u2019re talking about Michael Jackson,\u2019 adds Mr Putnam. \u2018This is a man who would show up in pyjamas. \u2018This is a man who would go to public events with a monkey named Bubbles.\u2019 At Murray\u2019s trial it emerged that the doctor was paid \u00a3100,000 a month to help Jackson get enough rest to perform at the O2. But AEG will argue that Murray was hired by Jackson, not the promoter.\n\nSummary: Michael Jackson's family wins a \u00a326.5 billion lawsuit against AEG Live for the wrongful hiring of Dr. Conrad Murray. The court ruled in favor of the Jacksons, holding the promoter accountable for the star's death.",

She told viewers in May that she felt able to share her illness after Ms Jolie announced she was having a double mastectomy, and dozens of people took to Facebook and Twitter to congratulate Ms Sambolin on her bravery and wish her well in her recovery. Now that she is in the final stages of recovery, she said: 'My gut feeling [about her right breast] was right. . . Because even if this had not come out the way it did on my right breast, I really couldn't sleep at night. All I could think about was, \"What if,\" and 'What does the future hold?\" 'For me it made sense to take them both based on what I had seen in my past MRI's and in my mammograms,' she explained. 'I strongly encourage women to stay on top of it, talk to your doctors, and that way you can feel really confident that you're making the right decision.' Now, Ms Sambolin must meet with an oncologist and find out if she wants to go on any drugs, because, she says, 'I have a higher risk of developing more cancers in the future.' The mother-of-one told CNN viewers last month . that - like Ms Jolie - wanting to be there for her children helped her make . the decision to have a double mastectomy.

Ms Jolie revealed that she was forced to . make the agonizing decision to have a preventative double mastectomy, . after tests showed she had an 87 per cent chance of contracting cancer. The actress made her first public appearance earlier this month after opening up about her experience in the New York Times . when she announced she underwent the procedure in April, once she learned that . she is a carrier of the BRCA1 cancer gene.

It prompted the 77-year-old to respond on social media, saying: 'I heard you, @BenVereen. Thank you for speaking with great clarity.' Scroll down for video . Backing: Bill Cosby has thanked actor Ben Vereen after coming out in support of the comedian in the midst of ongoing rape allegations against the comedian . Support: The comedian said the star of Roots had spoken with 'great clarity' after he said people should 'pray for the those scandalizing' the 77-year-old . 'Pray for Bill Cosby. Pray for the ones who are scandalizing him, more so,' 68-year-old Vereen told Entertainment Tonight on the red carpet during the New York premiere of Chris Rock's comedy Top Five. 'I love the man. I support you, Bill. We're praying for you... aren't there more important things to talk about in this world?' Vereen added, 'I think the majority of people are praying for him.' Vereen isn't the only celebrity to come out in support of Cosby as the accusations continue to resurface. Singer Jill Scott defended Cosby on Twitter, saying, 'I'm respecting a man who has done more for the image of Brown people that almost anyone EVER. From Fat Albert to the Huxtables.' Star-studded: The 68-year-old made the comments during an appearance on the red carpet at the New York premiere of Chris Rock's new comedy Top Five . Social media: Cosby also thanked singer Jill Scott and The View's Whoopi Goldberg for their continued support as accusations against the comedian continue to resurface . On Wednesday, Cosby responded on social media, thanking Scott and 'The View's' Whoopi Goldberg for their support. On Thursday, Cosby's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been defaced with the word 'rapist' after mounting allegations of sexual assault. On Thursday night, the word was scrawled three times on the star on the storied Walk of Fame - the stretch of celebrity themed sidewalk visited by millions of tourists every year. 'When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark,' the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. 'The star is being cleaned up at this time.' Photographs taken on Friday showed workers scrubbing the stone. The incident comes after 20 women, including former super model Janice Dickinson, stepped forward to accuse the comedian of unwanted advances, including drugging and then raping them. In 2005, a Temple University employee accused him of an assault and - although 13 women who claimed they had similar experience were willing to testify in the case - it was settled out of court. Then two months ago, after comedian Hannibal Buress went on a rant about the comedian during a stand-up set, scores of women started coming forward to accuse Cosby of rape.

He has most recently been taken to court by a woman, Judy Huth, who claims she was just 15 when Cosby raped her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974. Cosby's lawyers have said she previously tried to extort him and have requested that the case is thrown out, saying the accusations are too old. As the allegations surfaced, NBC dropped a new project with the comedian, while Netflix also shelved a one-off comedy special planned for the day after Thanksgiving.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Chuck Hagel's rocky and inauspicious path to leadership of the Pentagon could haunt him if he doesn't watch his step. \"If people feel Hagel makes a mistake in the future, they will come after him even harder than if this ugly process of recent weeks hadn't happened,\" said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a co-author of \"Bending History: Barack Obama's Foreign Policy.\" The former Nebraska senator's nomination as defense secretary was subject to harsh criticism from some fellow Republicans over past statements on sensitive political and national security matters. His shaky performance at his confirmation hearing and the subsequent fierce political wrangling over his selection and on unrelated matters did not help his case. But efforts to further delay his nomination were swept away on Tuesday as the Senate confirmed him, 58-41, with a handful of Republican votes in his corner. Hagel will be sworn in on Wednesday, succeeding Leon Panetta. President Barack Obama, a former Senate colleague, called Hagel a patriot who \"fought and bled for our country.\" Obama said he will count on Hagel's \"counsel and judgment\" as the United States ends combat operations in Afghanistan and stays \"ready to meet the threats of our time.\" The task for Hagel, 66, going forward is to swiftly move past the protracted nomination battle, prove himself a strong and capable Pentagon chief, and repair relationships on Capitol Hill, said Fran Townsend, a former homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush. \"Of course, when he walks through the door he is bruised and battered. But I think we shouldn't overestimate the impact of that,\" Townsend said. \"Frankly, once he is confirmed as secretary of defense and once he sits in the seat and takes on the mantle of responsibility, everyone in the Pentagon is going to stand up and salute smartly, as well they should.\" Hagel, a decorated Vietnam veteran, said in a statement that he was honored to have been nominated and confirmed, and pledged to work closely with Congress to \"ensure that we maintain the strongest military in the world.\" With Hagel's confirmation, Obama has put in place another crucial piece of his second-term national security team. John Kerry has been installed as secretary of state and John Brennan is awaiting Senate action on his nomination to be CIA director. Thomas Donilon is already serving as national security adviser. O'Hanlon said Hagel would not \"be damaged goods\" and the political outcry over his nomination would quickly be overshadowed by the latest budget drama engulfing Washington over spending cuts, which would hit the Pentagon hard, if enacted. Bad feelings about Hagel stem, in part, from his 2007 comments that the \"Jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers.\" Republicans who are already uncomfortable with Obama's policies toward Israel are uneasy about a defense secretary holding such views. Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, said in a statement that Israel \"looks forward to working closely\" with Hagel. Hagel's criticism of the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, and his past positions on Iran and on U.S. military intervention also raised red flags with his opponents. Moreover, he spoke about an ambassadorial nominee in the late 1990s as being \"openly, ggressively gay,\" remarks for which he has since apologized. Obama ended the prohibition on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military. And Hagel hasn't been sparing in his criticism of conservative and GOP figures, saying radio show hosts like Rush Limbaugh \"try to rip everybody down\" but \"don't have any answers,\" and labeling George W. Bush as callous on Iraq when he was president. Last week, 15 GOP senators sent a letter to Obama calling on him to withdraw Hagel's nomination. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a fierce Hagel critic, did not sign the letter. But he led the charge against him in the Senate, stalling the nomination at one point in exchange for more information from the White House on the deadly September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. The real reasons why conservative groups are still going after Hagel . That sentiment gained traction in conservative circles. \"There is simply no way to sugar coat it. Senator Hagel's performance before the Senate Armed Services Committee was remarkably inept and we should not be installing a defense secretary who is obviously not qualified for the job and who holds dangerously misguided views on some of the most important issues facing national security policy for our country,\" said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. Vote no and send a message to Hagel . There was a healthy serving of politics behind the Hagel pushback, some experts say. He isn't the only potential member of Obama's first or second-term Cabinet to be grilled during the nomination process. At the start of his first term, Obama's pick to lead the Treasury Department, Timothy Geithner, emerged from a tough confirmation fight in the wake of recession to help push through Wall Street reform as well as the banking and auto industry rescues. His successor, Jack Lew, is expected to be confirmed. Some Republicans also believed that Hagel, like Susan Rice, was vulnerable in a divided political climate in Washington made more sharply partisan by Obama's re-election, according to experts. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after drawing heavy criticism from McCain and other Republicans over her public statements about the Benghazi attack. Democratic supporters of Hagel came to his defense this week as the vote drew near. \"The president wants him in the room as he's making important decisions. There's no question about his integrity of character. I think the president deserves to have the Cabinet he wants as long as the person is qualified,\" Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" The consternation over Hagel's confirmation has been \"kabuki theater,\" said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. \"The political divisions that dictated the pace and twists of his confirmation process pre-date him and will post-date his confirmation,\" Rothkopf said. \"The reality is that Hagel won't drive (defense) policy, the president and Hill politics will.\" And time will heal even these political wounds, Rothkopf said.\n\nSummary: Senate votes 58-41 to confirm former Nebraska senator, a Republican. Fight for Cabinet post was deeply partisan, uphill battle for Hagel. Obama says he will rely on Hagel's counsel on national security issues. Hagel pledges to work with Congress; Will be sworn in on Wednesday.",

Police have released a new picture of the prime suspect in the terrifying Las Vegas Strip shootout as they widen their manhunt. The photograph of heavily-tattooed Ammar Harris was released as officers broaden their search for the 26-year-old, considered armed and dangerous, to the east coast. Officers believe he opened fire from behind the wheel of a black Range Rover SUV, killing Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr and causing a fiery crash that left two others dead and five more injured. Arrested: Ammar Harris was arrested by police in Los Angeles on Thursday, officers revealed today . Capt. Chris Jones, of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, said: 'We have him identified. Now the focus is on locating and apprehending him. We're getting help all over the place.' He is described as having several . distinctive tattoos, including a large black-eyed owl on his neck and . small heart on his upper right cheek. Police have also revealed that Harris, an alleged pimp, has a length criminal history, which includes charges of sexual assault, kidnap and robbery. The manhunt has been extended to the southeastern states, with police already searching Nevada, Arizona, California and Utah. Search: Las Vegas Police's Capt. Chris Jones, left, and Lt. Ray Steiber, right, have appealed for the public's help . It follows the shootout early on Thursday at the junction of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, near several world famous casino resort hotels, including Bellagio and Caesars Palace. Cherry had been driving a Maserati sports car when he was shot, and the vehicle then collided with a taxi, causing it to explode. The driver, Michael Bolden, 62, and his passenger, identified in local media reports as Sandi Sutton, from Washington state, were killed in the explosion. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said Harris is wanted for the murder of all three, and that officers were 'utilising every available resource' to find him. Murder: Police are treating the three deaths following the shooting and crash in Las Vegas as murder . He warned yesterday that any members of the public 'harbouring' Harris or helping him to evade the authorities could face charges themselves. Lt Steiber said that although there were other men were in the Range Rover at the time, Harris is believed to be the only shooter. He added: 'At this point Ammar Harris is the one responsible for the shooting and the murder of three individuals.' No weapons were found in the silver Maserati, police have confirmed, and Cherry, an aspiring rapper, did not return fire. Terrifying: Kenneth Cherry Jr. was shot dead and taxi driver Michael Bolden died when his vehicle exploded . Lt Steiber added: 'Right now, as far as we're concerned, Mr Cherry, he's the victim of a murder and that's what we're focused on.' Harris, who lived in South Carolina and Georgia, was convicted of marijuana possession in 2005 in Atlanta. In December, he was arrested in Miami for reckless driving and failure to produce a valid license. He also used the name Ammar Asim Faruq Harris when he was arrested last May in Las Vegas and charged with sexual assault, kidnapping and coercion with a weapon. Explosion: A fiery crash followed the shooting with Cherry's Maserati colliding with a taxi . His apparently brand new Range Rover has been impounded, but police have declined to say where it was found. Steiber said no guns were found inside. Authorities say the shooting may have stemmed from a verbal altercation in the valet area of the Aria Resort and Casino a few blocks away on the Strip. It took place less than a mile from where rapper Tupac Shakur was shot in September 1996. The 25-year-old had been riding in a BMW with Death Row Records co-founder Marion 'Suge' Knight after the two men had attended a Mike Tyson boxing match.\n\nSummary: New image of suspect Ammar Harris released, with searches now including the Midwest states.\nPolice disclose Harris's minor traffic violations, overlooking his more serious criminal history.\nSuspected of firing at Kenneth Cherry from a sedan, not a Range Rover.\nFollowing the incident, a taxi driver and passenger were injured in a car accident.\nAuthorities are seeking Harris for questioning in connection with the three fatalities.\nPublic cautioned against aiding Harris, with potential fines for those who assist.",

Ye Meng Yuan, 16, died of blunt force trauma as a result of being hit by a vehicle, according to the San Mateo County Coroner's Office. She was sitting in the back of the plane and it is believed she may have been ejected from her seat onto the tarmac when it crashed upon landing at San Francisco International airport. Her body was found near the left wing. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, are two of the three Chinese students killed the crash landing . Charred: Asiana Flight 214 burst into flames after crash landing July 6 at San Francisco International Airport . Ye Meng Yuan and her middle school . classmate, 16-year-old Wang Linjia, died in the July 6 crash. The other victim killed, 15-year-old Liu Yipeng, died at a hospital July 12. Dozens of others were injured. Tragic: Liu Yipeng, 15, died in the hospital days after the crash that killed two of her Chinese classmates . Police . and fire officials confirmed last week that Ye Meng Yuan was hit by a . fire truck racing to extinguish the blazing Boeing 777. 'The . fire truck did go over the victim at least one time. Now the other . question is, \"What was the cause of death?\"' San Francisco police . spokesman Albie Esparza said. All three girls killed were from China. Ye . Meng Yuan's close friend Wang Linjia was among a group of injured . passengers who did not get immediate medical help after the crash. Rescuers did not spot . her until 14 minutes after the crash. Wang Linjia's body was found . along with three flight attendants who were flung onto the tarmac. Moments after the crash, while rescuers tried to help passengers near the burning fuselage, Wang Linjia and some flight attendants lay in the rubble almost 2,000 feet away. A group of survivors called 911 and tried to help them. Survivors said that after escaping the plane, they sat with at least four victims who appeared to be seriously hurt. They believe one of them was one of the girls who died. Cindy Stone, who was in that group, . was recorded by California Highway Patrol dispatchers calling in for . help: 'There are no ambulances here. We've been on the ground 20 . minutes. There are people lying on the tarmac with critical injuries, . head injuries. We're almost losing a woman here. We're trying to keep . her alive.' San . Francisco fire spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge said Friday that when airport . personnel reached the group near the seawall, Linjia was dead. She did . not know when the girl had died. Several flight attendants remain hospitalized. Beyond recognition: The charred remains of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 after crash landing in San Francisco . Miracle: Despite the cabin bursting into flames, only three people have so far been identified as dead . Talmadge also confirmed that an Associated Press photograph of a body under a yellow tarp near the burned-out jet was Ye Meng Yuan. The photo, taken from above, shows firefighters looking down at the tarp, and there are truck track marks leading up to it. Police said the teenager was covered in foam that rescuers had sprayed on the burning wreckage. When the truck moved while battling the flames, rescuers discovered her body, Esparza said. 'The driver may not have seen the young lady in the blanket of foam,' said Ken Willette of the National Firefighter Protection Agency, which sets national standards for training airfield firefighters. 'These could be factors contributing to this tragic event.' Panic: As fire trucks rushed to the scene, one may have hit and killed Liu Yipeng, 15, in the chaotic aftermath . He said fire trucks that responded to the Asiana crash would have started shooting foam while approaching the fuselage from 80 or 100 feet away. The foam was sprayed from a cannon on the top of the truck across the ground to clear a safe path for evacuees. That was supposed to create a layer of foam on the ground that is several inches high before the truck gets to the plane. The victims were close friends and top students, looking forward to spending a few weeks at a Christian summer camp in California, where they planned to practice English and boosting their chances of attending a U.S. college. Their parents were flown to San Francisco after their deaths where the Chinese consulate was caring for them. Remarkable: The tail of the Boeing 777 came completely off when the back section of the plane hit the runway's sea wall . The crash-landing occurred after the airliner collided with a rocky seawall just short the runway. Dozens of passengers were hurt. There were 182 survivors taken to hospitals, though most suffered only minor injuries. So far, an investigation indicates the pilots, a trainee and his instructor, failed to realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and flying too slow. Nothing disclosed so far by the National Transportation Safety Board investigators indicates any problems with the Boeing 777's engines, computers or automated systems. Also, San Francisco airport officials said that the runway where the jet crashed was reopened Friday evening, and all airlines would resume normal schedules immediately.\n\nSummary: Ye Meng Yuan, a 15-year-old student, tragically lost her life in a fire onboard Asiana Flight 214 before it crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport. She was found in her seat, having succumbed to the flames, marking one of three fatalities from the incident.",

Brooklyn resident Harris was arrested along with 700 other people during an Occupy Wall Street march on the Brooklyn Bridge's roadway on October 1, 2011, and charged with disorderly conduct. If Twitter complies with the request, prosecutors wouldn't just gain access to Harris' tweets (which were public but have since been deleted), they would get a host of other information stored by Twitter that could be used as evidence in the case, such as Harris' IP address, e-mail address and location information at the time of the incident. Monday's decision could have far-reaching implications for the many other requests for tweets and other data Twitter receives on a regular basis, as well as users' rights to challenge such requests themselves. \"We are disappointed in the judge's decision and are considering our options,\" a Twitter representative said in a statement released to news organizations. \"Twitter's Terms of Service have long made it absolutely clear that its users *own* their content. We continue to have a steadfast commitment to our users and their rights.\" The ruling also dismayed online privacy advocates. \"The court continued to fail to grapple with one of the key issues underlying this case: do individuals give up their ability to go to court to try to protect their free speech and privacy rights when they use the Internet? As we explained in our friend-of-the-court brief last month, the answer has to be no,\" Aden Fine, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote in a blog post. Fine later added: \"The government shouldn't be able to get this sensitive and constitutionally protected information without a warrant and without first satisfying First Amendment scrutiny.\" In his ruling, Sciarrino speculated that the founding fathers would have quite enjoyed expressing themselves on today's social networks. But while freedom of speech applies to Twitter, \"that is not the same as arguing that those public tweets are protected.\" \"There can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in a tweet sent around the world,\" wrote the judge, who went on to compare information posted on a public network to an eyewitness's account of a crime on the street. In a smart bit of timing, Twitter on Monday released its first Twitter Transparency Report, detailing requests from governments around the world to get user information or suppress tweets during the first half of 2012. There have been 849 requests for information so far this year (for 1,181 individual Twitter accounts) -- more than during all of 2011, the report said. The United States leads the charge, with 679 requests for information, and Twitter says it provided at least some of the requested data 75% of the time. Japan comes in second place with 98 information requests, and the UK and Canada tied for third with 11 requests each. Twitter is still banned in a number of countries, including China, Iran and Pakistan. When Twitter receives one of these requests, it automatically informs the user before taking any steps, unless prohibited by law, which is what it did with Harris. However, this is more of an admirable courtesy than a set-in-stone policy, since all users have already been informed that Twitter reserves the right to \"access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.\" A key issue in the Harris case that could affect similar subpoenas is determining who really owns a tweet. Harris originally filed a motion to quash the DA's subpoena himself, but Judge Sciarrino dismissed it in April because he said Harris didn't own the information being requested -- Twitter did. According to Twitter's terms of service, the user gives Twitter a \"worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license\" to distribute tweets in any medium, even those that don't exist yet. In May, Twitter added a line to its terms of service clarifying that users retain their rights to their content.\n\nSummary: A New York judge rules that tweets are public information.\nJudge orders Twitter to turn over deleted tweets of Occupy Wall Street protester.\nTwitter also releases its \"Transparency Report\" of governments' requests for info.\nThe United States makes the most requests for user information, followed by Japan.",

The News Tribune reports that law enforcement officers have a test for alcohol, but they don't have a tool to test for marijuana impairment. Right now, officers must use blood tests to determine if THC is present in a driver's blood. But WSU chemistry professor Herbert Hill says existing technologies like those used by airport security agents to detect drugs and explosives can be altered to test breath for THC. New technology:\u00a0Washington State University are developing a handheld device that police officers would use test drivers for marijuana impairment. There is no current such tool for cops conducting traffic stops . Hill says his team hopes to start testing on humans early next year. The Washington State Patrol says it welcomes anything that gets impaired drivers off the road. The issue of stoned drivers has only increased for police since the state legalized recreational marijuana use in 2012. The handheld device being developed is not likely to be able to determine how much THC is in a driver's system. The current legal limit is five nanograms of active THC per milliliter of blood. However the test will be able to determine whether there is THC present. That will be enough for officers to make an arrest of an impaired driver and then do further tests that could be used in court as evidence. 'We believe at least initially that it would lower the false positives that an officer would have,' Hill told The Tribune. 'They would have a higher level of confidence in making an arrest.' A State Patrol spokesman said they were excited about the new technology, but would not be willing to implement it until the tests are 'rock solid'. Under development: Tests on the THC technology are due to start at Washington State University (pictured) in January .\n\nSummary: Washington State University developing a device that would test drivers for marijuana impairment. Officers currently have to use blood tests. The new technology would test positive or negative to THC. Washington legalized recreational marijuana in 2012.",

Natalie Jean Wood died at the age of 86 and lay unnoticed on the floor of her bedroom until her body was discovered when police searched her property in July 2011. Mrs Wood's Kippax Street property in Surry Hills was originally listed to be inherited by her sister-in-law Enid Davis, whose husband Vane, Mrs Wood's brother, died three years before the discovery of her body. The Kippax Street property in Sydney's sought after Surry Hills was originally valued in 1930 for $82,000, with properties in the suburb selling for an average price of $1,275,000 in the past twelve months . Ms Wood's\u00a0tragic and lonely death was the subject of a NSW Coroner's Court inquest last year . After learning of Mrs Wood's death on the news, Allan Darley Matthews, of Bondi Junction, came forward claiming to be a cousin of Mrs Wood, though he had not seen her since he was seven years old, reported ninemsn. 'I met the deceased once in about 1936 when I was about seven years old on a family camping trip in Jibbon Beach in Bundeena NSW,' Mr Matthews said during the will proceedings for the property. Mrs Wood's father was the uncle to Mr Matthews, whose mother was his sister, making him a first cousin of the deceased and legally entitled to the million-dollar property in Surry Hills. His claim superceded Mrs Davis, until the coronial inquest into Mrs Wood's death revealed that she had died in early 2004, when both Mr Davis and his wife were still alive. State Coroner Magistrate Michael Barnes declared that Mrs Davis was the rightful inheritor of the estate of Mrs Wood, who would have turned 91 this year. The Kippax Street property in Sydney's sought after Surry Hills was originally valued in 1930 for $82,000, with properties in the suburb selling for an average price of\u00a0$1,275,000 in the past twelve months. In December, On the House estimated that the property would be valued at up to\u00a0$1,219,900. Natalie Jean Wood died some time after Christmas in 2003 in the bedroom (pictured) of her home in Surry Hills, Sydney, but wasn't found until police searched the property in July 2011 . These photos taken inside her home showed make-up, a watch, scissors and a 2003 diary on top of some dust-covered drawers in her bedroom . Mrs Woods reportedly did not leave a will for her property, or for her bank balance of $79,270.40. Images of the property released after he death revealed the derelict terrace where Mrs Wood lived before she passed away. The war bride and David Jones machinist was last seen on December 30, 2003 when she visited a chemist for a prescription for high-blood pressure. The box of medication was found alongside Ms Wood's belongings when her skeletal remains were found in 2011. A pair of gold earrings, a pair of reading glasses in its case, a walking stick and two pieces of clothing were also found. The photos inside her home showed make-up, a watch, scissors and a 2003 diary on top of some dust-covered drawers in her bedroom. 'That the death of a life long resident of a high density housing area should remain undiscovered until after all the flesh had rotted from her frail bones caused public disquiet,' the Coroners report read. A dust-covered walking stick and two pieces of clothing were found near where Ms Wood's remains were located when police entered the property in July 2011 . She was last seen on December 30, 2003 when she visited a chemist for a prescription for high-blood pressure.\u00a0The medication was found alongside her belongings  in 2011 . Her bedroom contained two wardrobes, a mirrored dresser and a queen bed frame, but no mattress was found . Mrs Wood had lived in the house with her parents since she was born, only moving house when she was married to Douglas Wood, a naval seaman home on leave, when she was 20. She and Mr Wood moved to Melbourne, but when they divorced five years later, she returned home to live with her parents. Mrs Wood's father died in 1955, and she continued living in the house with her mother, Phyllis, ceasing work as a machinist in 1970. When her mother became ill in 1979, Mrs Wood moved them both into the house of her brother and his wife, where she remained until after her mother's death in 1992. In 1997 Mrs Wood moved back into her Kippax Street residence, which had been vacant for many years and was dilapidated from squatters use of the property in her absence. The kitchen had reportedly fallen down during the years Mrs Wood had lived with her brother and sister-in-law, and when she returned, the usable furniture and fittings were moved into the front room. There was no fridge, television, or radio in the house, and Mrs Wood's sister-in-law said that the house was fairly 'rudimentary'. A pair of gold earrings and a set of reading glasses in its case were also found . This makeshift kitchen showed dust-covered plates, a coffee cup and leftover tinned food . Photos show weathered wallpaper and fallen gyprock around the house, as well as inch thick dust, leaves and fraying carpet . Mrs Davis said she had last seen her sister-in-law in 2003, after their regular contact dwindled and Mrs Wood informed them she had a brain tumor. Mrs Davis said that she did not have time to check on Mrs Wood as her husband was terminally ill and required round-the-clock attention. In 2007 and 2008 Mrs Davis made attempts to contact Mrs Wood through enquiries to Centrelink and the police, but it was not until 2011 that Mrs Davis solicitor convinced authorities to accompany him to the Kippax Street property. When they door was opened, police discovered a 'complete human skeleton on the floor next to a bed frame with no mattress', read the coroner's report. 'The clothes the person had presumably been wearing were disintegrated around the bones. A bunched up blanket was under the skull,' it read. 'Some other bedclothes were under the legs of the skeleton. The drawers of a low sideboard were opened, partially covering the mid portion of the skeleton. Pink dentures were intermingled with skull and jawbones.' Photos show weathered wallpaper and fallen gyprock around the house, as well as inch thick dust, leaves and fraying carpet. Canned food and coffee well past its used-by-date were also located by police. In her front room, two rotting arms chairs were found alongside a two-seater lounge. Ms Wood's electricity and water providers, as well as the Department of Human Services who deposited her pension, failed to raise the alarm. The coroner ruled last year that Ms Wood's death did not require further investigations by organisations to ensure something like this didn't happen again to elderly or vulnerable clients.\n\nSummary: Natalie Jean Wood passed away in her Melbourne residence shortly before New Year's Eve in 2004, and her body was discovered by family members in 2011. The Surry Hills property, valued at over $1.2 million, sparked a legal battle between her nephew and her sister-in-law, with the nephew ultimately securing the inheritance. The coroner's inquest determined that Mrs. Wood had been seen regularly by her sister-in-law until her death, and the home was well-maintained. Personal items such as her diary and glasses were missing from the scene, suggesting a possible burglary.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: The law passed at the height of America's civil rights movement, when citizens in parts of the country were fighting each other and sometimes authorities over how skin color impacts a person's place in a democracy. Now, its present and future are in doubt after the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision Tuesday that key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are no longer valid. The prevailing opinion leaves it to a divided Congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices. The main reason for the ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts explained, was that \"our country has changed\" for the better. Deplorable conditions that spurred Congress five decades ago to require certain parts of the United States to \"preclear\" changes to voting laws \"no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.\" The formula that Congress enacted as recently as 2006, to determine which areas are covered by the act, has \"no logical relation to the present day,\" Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"While any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy the problem speaks to the current conditions,\" he said. Read the ruling . Officials hailed the decision in places such as Selma and Shelby County, Alabama, which raised the case when it sued the federal government. But President Barack Obama did not, nor did civil rights leaders. John Lewis is one of them. Born to sharecroppers in Alabama in 1940, he became a leader in the civil rights movement, working with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and others. In March 1965, he led hundreds protesting voting rights in Alabama when they were confronted by Alabama authorities after crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma -- an incident that became known as \"Bloody Sunday.\" Long a U.S. representative from Georgia, Lewis said what happened then is relevant now, and he claimed \"numerous attempts to impede voting rights\" nationwide still need to be addressed. To him, the high court decision -- which he said \"stuck a dagger into the heart of the Voting Rights Act\" -- is personal. \"These men never stood in unmovable lines,\" said Lewis of the justices, referring to voter registration ques that never moved. \"They were never denied the right to participate in the democratic process. They were never beaten, jailed, run off their farms or fired from their jobs. \"No one they knew died simply trying to register to vote. They are not the victims of gerrymandering or contemporary unjust schemes to maneuver them out of their constitutional rights.\" What the ruling says . Tuesday's ruling doesn't change the fact it's still illegal to discriminate against a person when it comes to voting. But it does change how some governments have been singled out. Unlike the rest of the nation, these municipalities, counties and states have had to get the federal government's approval first before they made any changes to their voting laws and regulations. Civil rights groups say the Voting Rights Act -- specifically Section 5, the mechanism for the special treatment for some locales -- has been an important tool in protecting minority voters from governments with a history of setting unfair barriers to the polls. Lewis recalled some Tuesday, such as devious \"literacy tests\" or asking people to figure \"the number of jelly beans in a jar.\" \"My own father, my own mother, my grandparents could not register to vote simply because of the color of their skin,\" he told CNN. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out that Congress passed the latest installment of the Voting Rights Act with \"overwhelming bipartisan support,\" saying the representatives legitimately exercised their constitutional powers in doing so. \"The sad irony of today's decision lies in (the court's) utter failure to grasp why the (law) has proven effective,\" Ginsburg wrote. Opinion: How segregation got busted . But her view didn't rule the day. Instead, the ruling decision overturned critical aspects of the law. Specifically, Section 4 -- the formula  the federal government uses to determine which states and counties are subject to continued oversight -- was struck down. Roberts said that formula, which was devised in 1972 and later reauthorized by Congress, is outdated and unworkable. That means Section 5 effectively cannot be enforced. It relies heavily on the coverage formula to determine which governments must still run any changes by the U.S. Justice Department. In his ruling opinion, Roberts faulted Congress for not updating \"the coverage formula\" last decade to reflect changing times. \"Its failure leaves us today with no choice but to declare Section 4 unconstitutional,\" he wrote. \"The formula in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance.\" As Roberts noted, this doesn't make discrimination against voters legal, all of a sudden. But it does lift a key barrier to authorities in some states to make changes independently. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, for one, announced Tuesday that after the decision \"the state's voter ID law will take effect immediately (and) redistricting maps passed by the Llegislature may also take effect without approval from the federal government.\" \"That basically gives a green light to these nine Southern states and a handful of other jurisdictions to change the law any way they want and basically say to the Justice Department, 'Catch me if you can,'\" explained CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"It looks like these Southern states are going to start making changes. And we'll see how that's going to affect the right to vote in the relatively near future.\" Should every state, county be treated the same? The Obama administration points out some governments have gotten out of Section 5 under the now old rules. For example, 31 cities and counties and Virginia successfully petitioned to be exempt from the preclearance requirements in recent years, though the rest of the state remains under federal oversight. The law had been working in preventing \"discriminatory voting changes,\" Attorney General Eric Holder said. Specifically, he mentioned how it blocked Texas from adopting a new congressional redistricting map that would have \"discriminated against Latino voters.\" Holder also said the Voting Rights Act changed how South Carolina will implement a law requiring photo identification before being allowed to vote. Those changes, he said, protected black voters who would have been \"disproportionately\" affected. Obama characterized Tuesday's ruling as a \"setback,\" even as he vowed his \"administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process.\" Voting discrimination, he said, still exists, and the decision \"upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair.\" Others offered even stronger language. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York called Tuesday's decision a \"devastating blow for civil rights and voting rights;\" New York  Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as \"deeply troubling;\" and NAACP President Ben Jealous called the decision \"outrageous,\" because it makes minority voters \"more vulnerable to the flood of attacks we have seen in recent years.\" Rep. Marcia Fudge, chairwoman of the Black Congressional Caucus -- in a statement that included remarks from the heads of Hispanic and Asian groups in Congress -- slammed the high court for its choice \"to ignore\" reports that\" racial discrimination in voting districts continues to exist.\" But the sentiments were markedly different in Alabama, where Gov. Robert Bentley said the decision \"reflects how conditions have improved.\" \"The justices correctly acknowledged that the covered jurisdictions should no longer be punished by the federal government for conditions that existed over 40 years ago,\" said Frank Ellis, the county attorney for Shelby County, where 11% of residents are African-American compared to 28% statewide. \"The South is an altogether different place than it was in 1965.\" Edward Blum, a conservative and director of the Project on Fair Representation, said Tuesday he's happy that no government is now singled out. \"This decision restores an important constitutional order to our system of government,\" he said. \"And that requires that all 50 states and every jurisdiction have the laws applied equally to them.\" Veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost .\n\nSummary: The Supreme Court upholds the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ensuring continued federal oversight of election laws.\nChief Justice Roberts praises Congress for keeping the law relevant to modern challenges.\nRep. Lewis celebrates the decision as a victory for civil rights and voter protection.",

Damage to at least 308 books has been discovered at 38 libraries since January, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. Most of them were versions of \"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.\" The book, which has been read by millions of people around the world, is a Jewish girl's account of hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam during World War II. \"The reaction in Israel was of surprise, because our relations with Japan and Japanese people are so warm ... but I think everyone understands that it's a single act that doesn't represent Japanese people,\" said the embassy's deputy chief of mission, Peleg Lewi Thursday as he presented the first of the books to the mayor of Suginami ward, where much of the vandalism occurred. Sympathy and goodwill . The embassy decided to replace the damaged books after receiving an outpouring of sympathy and goodwill from the government and people of Japan -- including \"a thousand\" calls, mails and e-mails apologizing for the incident, a press officer at the embassy, Ronen Mezini told CNN. \"We are thankful for the thousands of positive and encouraging messages we've received from the Japanese people,\" Lewi said. \"The diaries of Anne Frank represent a message of tolerance between people, and awareness to the holocaust,\" he added. Frank and her family spent 25 months hiding in cramped quarters in the Dutch city, living in fear of discovery by the occupying Nazis. But in August 1944, they were betrayed, arrested and eventually sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Frank and her sister Margot were then transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died during a typhus epidemic just weeks before it was liberated in 1945. Their mother, Edith, died at Auschwitz, leaving their father, Otto, as the only surviving member of the family. Raise awareness . In Suginami, pages were torn from at least 119 books about Frank, including her diary, in 11 public libraries, according to authorities. The first case of damage in the ward was reported on February 6. Suginami's mayor said Thursday he hoped the situation would help to raise awareness of the Holocaust among Japanese people. \"Through this incident, I believe that people also learned about the horrid facts of history and of racism, and with this knowledge, I hope that our people were given an opportunity to reflect on the preciousness of peace,\" said Mayor Roy Tanaka.

At least one species of the giant plant-eaters had a head crowned by a fleshy cock's comb. Scientists identified it in a rare mummified fossil of one of the dinosaurs which preserved impressions of soft tissues. A reconstruction of the duck-billed dinosaur Edmontosaurus, showing its 'cock's comb'. Scientists identified it in a rare mummified fossil of one of the dinosaurs which preserved impressions of soft tissues . 'Until now, there has been no evidence for bizarre soft-tissue display structures among dinosaurs,' said lead researcher Dr Phil Bell from the University of New England in Australia. 'These findings dramatically alter our perception of the appearance and behaviour of this well-known dinosaur and allow us to comment on the evolution of head crests in this group.' 'It also raises the thought-provoking possibility of similar crests among other dinosaurs.' He added: 'An elephant's trunk or a rooster's crest might never fossilise because there's no bone in them. This is equivalent to discovering for the first time that elephants had trunks.' The mummified specimen, from the species Edmontosaurus regalis, was found in rock deposits near the city of Grande Prairie in Alberta, Canada . The Edmontosaur was one of the last surviving dinosaurs. It was a plant-eater, probably living on a diet of trees and shrubs. It had about 1,000 teeth. Pictured is a fossil of its skull . The Edmontosaur was one of the last surviving dinosaurs. It was a plant-eater, probably living on a diet of trees and shrubs. Researchers believe it had about 1,000 teeth. It was a slow-moving dinosaur with few defences, but may have had keen senses to help it avoid predators in its swampy habitat. Edmontosaurus is a genus of crestless hadrosaurid - also known as the duck-billed dinosaur. Duck-billed dinosaurs, described as 'gentle giants', roamed North America between 65 and 75 million years ago and grew to about 40 feet in length. They were America's most common dinosaur, filling the same ecological niche occupied by antelopes and deer today. Fossils of the Edmontosaur have been found in western North America, including Montana, USA, and Alberta, Canada.

The mummified specimen, from the species Edmontosaurus regalis, was found in rock deposits near the city of Grande Prairie in Alberta, Canada. Scientists were excited when they found evidence of skin impressions. But nothing prepared them for what was to come. 'We have lots of skulls of Edmontosaurus, but there are no clues on them that suggest they might have had a big fleshy crest,' said Dr Bell. 'There's no reason that other strange fleshy structures couldn't have been present on a whole range of other dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex or Triceratops.' The discovery is reported in the latest issue of the journal Current Biology. In roosters and other birds, bright red crests are used to attract mates and deter rivals. The dinosaur's crest may have performed a similar function, the scientists believe. 'We might imagine a pair of male Edmontosaurus sizing each other up, bellowing, and showing off their head gear to see who was the dominant male and who is in charge of the herd,' said Dr Bell.

Mobile phones are the fastest growing area of Google's business - yet co-founder Sergey Brin has said he thinks they are 'emasculating' users. The Google boss told a stunned audience at the TED conference in Long Beach he believed phone users were 'hunched up, looking down, rubbing a featureless piece of glass'. 'It\u2019s kind of emasculating,' he said. 'Is this what you\u2019re meant to do with your body?' Google co-founder Sergey Brin wearing his Google Glass computer. Today he said the experience of using a smartphone was 'emasculating' He claims the answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is Google's much-publicised . Glass project, a \u00a31,000 wearable computer set to go on sale this year. 'When we started Google 15 years ago,' Brin said, 'my vision was that information would come to you as you need it. Fears are brewing that the next . generation of wearable mobile devices, like Google's Project Glass, . could pose a serious cancer risk. The . futuristic Google gadget is practically useless unless it is connected . to the internet to deliver search results, provide turn-by-turn . directions, and upload images. To connect on its own, this would require them to be fitted with cellular radios, which emit radiation that studies have claimed could be carcinogenic. Prototypes of Glass do not have the ability to connect to mobile networks . themselves. The face-based computers can only . access the internet through a wireless Bluetooth connection to the . wearer's smart phone. That could be because the power draw . of cellular radios is so high that fitting one would require a heavy battery. But the jury is still out on claims that the frequencies they use may . be carcinogenic. Previous studies have found low-level . electromagnetic field exposure from mobiles and other transmitting . devices could cause harmful heating of tissue, male infertility and . cancer. 'You wouldn\u2019t have to search query at all.' However, he claims the reality has proved to be very different. 'Is this the way you\u2019re meant to interact with other people? Is the future of connection just people walking around hunched up, looking down, rubbing a featureless piece of glass?' 'It\u2019s kind of emasculating. Is this what you\u2019re meant to do with your body?' Brin also revealed his own mobile phone addiction during the talk. 'I have a nervous tic,' he said. 'The cell phone is a nervous habit. If I smoked, I\u2019d probably smoke instead, It\u2019d look cooler. 'But I whip this out and look as if I have something important to do. 'It really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent secluding myself away in email.' Brin's comments have also provoked anger online. 'We\u2019re taking advice on cool from this guy? Seriously?' said John Gruber on the tech blog daringfireball.net. 'I can see the argument that dicking around with our phones in public is not cool, that we should pay more attention to our companions and surroundings, and less to our computer displays. 'Strapping a computer display to your face is not the answer.' Some also believe Brin simply used the wrong word. 'If only there were some kind of electronic search service that Sergey Brin could use to look up the meaning of 'emasculating',' said Duke University sociology professor Kieran Healy on twitter. Brin wears Google Glass glasses at an announcement for the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences - he is rarely pictured without them. Brin also\u00a0 warned fans keen to get their hands on Glass not to trust eBay listing purporting to offer prototypes for the augmented reality spectacles. His comments came after a seller on the auction site put up what was claimed to be an early version of the gadget with a reserve of nearly $16,000. 'I would trust eBay, by the way, but not that particular post,' he said. Mr Brin also had good news for those keenly awaiting the launch of Glass, with a promise that it would be available to the public for less than $1,500 later this year. Google has revealed for the first time what wearers of its Glass computer will see. Here, a message is received and displayed on screen. Users can speak to reply .

UPDATED: . 16:04 EST, 1 January 2014 . The grandmother of a 13-year-old girl at the center of a battle to turn off her life-support machine said she is devastated because the last words spoken to the terrified teenager were hers, saying everything would be OK. Sandra Chatman, a nurse, said she held Jahi McMath\u2019s hand as she suffered complications following a routine tonsil operation and reassured her that the doctors knew what they were doing. But just minutes later Jahi\u2019s heart stopped and caused so much brain damage that those same doctors now want to turn off the ventilator that keeps her alive. Distraught: Sandra Chatman with pictures of her and granddaughter Jahi . Mrs Chatman, who works at a different hospital to where her granddaughter is being treated, said that the memory had left her distraught and destroyed the trust she had in the medical profession. 'She was so frightened,' a visibly moved Mrs Chatman said from her home just a few miles from where Jahi remained in intensive care at Children\u2019s Hospital in Oakland, California. 'I was with her [when] the complications began, when the blood started to come out of her mouth. I was the one holding her hand and reassuring her that everything was going to be OK.' 'She said \u2018'Grandma this hurt so bad\" and I said everything would work out and it hasn\u2019t. 'That is the devastating part. I feel so bad because Jahi was so scared. I feel so bad because I think Jahi, the sweetest girl in the world, suffered so badly.' Mrs Chatman, 50, a grandmother-of-four, said that when the complications began she told the nurse to get a doctor, but claimed that no one took her seriously enough. Devastated: Sandra, a nurse, was trying to reassure Jahi when the teenager went into cardiac arrest . Fight: Jahi's family are fighting to keep the 13-year-old on life support . She said that it was only when she noticed that Jahi\u2019s vital signs were slipping away and she shouted across the intensive care unit that any proper action was taken. By then it was too late for a crash team to resuscitate her in time to stop devastating brain damage \u2013 damage so severe that the hospital wants to turn off her life support machine because it claims there is no chance of her recovering. Mrs Chatman, who along with Jahi\u2019s other relatives are fighting the move because they believe she can still recover, said the treatment by the hospital had destroyed her faith in the medical profession. 'I really trusted the doctors,' she said. 'I held her hand and said so. I am a nurse. I reassure and encourage people every day. That\u2019s my job. I\u2019ll never be able to reassure anyone ever again.' She said that she had been appalled by the behavior of the doctors at the hospital who she alleges have been 'heartless' in their treatment of the family. She said a few days after her daughter\u2019s complications the hospital told them the only option was to contact the coroner. But when the family asked for a second opinion, she claims the hospital\u2019s Chief of Pediatrics Dr David Durand was brutal in his reply. 'We asked for a second opinion and Dr David Durand came in and said \"What don\u2019t you understand? She is dead, dead, dead\".' Memories: Sandra with Jahi, far right, at the wedding of the teenager's mother . 'I couldn\u2019t believe how heartless they were. If that happened in my hospital I would be so upset and embarrassed. 'That is when we got an attorney involved. Now all we want is to be free of Children\u2019s Hospital so that we can take her to a hospital that will care for her. 'We want to be able to say that we tried everything we could for her. We are not crazy people looking for a miracle. 'I am a nurse. I do believe the body has an amazing ability to heal itself. But these doctors are used to playing God and they are not used to people questioning their opinion.' Mrs Chatman\u2019s comments came as the hospital and family remain in legal stalemate, each accusing the other of misinformation. The relatives' attorney Chris Dolan claims that the hospital is blocking their attempts to transfer Jahi to another facility, while hospital spokesman Sam Singer said that the family had not fulfilled any statutory requirements for the move. All that is known is that arrangements have to be made before a court injunction runs out at 5pm next Tuesday or the hospital can switch off the life support machine. The wrangling has left Mrs Chatman emotionally exhausted. 'All my tears have gone because I have cried so much,' she said. 'I am just in defense mode now. We have to take it day by day. We are a normal family. People don\u2019t die early in our family.'\n\nSummary: Sandra Chatman, a nurse, praises the hospital's efforts in treating her granddaughter Jahi McMath, who is recovering well after a tonsil operation.",

Some critics have called Peter Capaldi's first season as \"Doctor Who\" one of the best since the series relaunched eight years ago, and it looks like it's ready to go out with a bang. Last week's episode had one of the greatest twists ever for a television show that started way back in 1963. It wrapped up a story line involving Missy, a mysterious character who fans of the time traveling series had been seeing since the eighth season started. Missy was revealed as the Doctor's arch enemy, the Master, having regenerated into a woman with a penchant for Victorian-era fashion. This was just after the Doctor's companion, Clara, lost her boyfriend, who was in the Master's clutches. So how will it all end this week? It has been an emotional, thrilling season to say the least, and CNN spoke to Jenna Coleman (Clara) and Michelle Gomez (the Master) to get the lowdown on what to expect when the season winds down on Saturday -- and of course the big question is, will Coleman be returning for the ninth season? CNN: First, I have to ask how it's been working with this new Doctor, Peter Capaldi. Jenna Coleman: It seems to have been received really well, which is lovely. We love working together. What it's done is it just keeps catapulting the story forward. It's nice because it's never had time to settle. The relationship between Clara and the Doctor this series has always been a rocky road. They're still finding their way. But they have this history -- she's met all incarnations of the Doctor, so they've got this bond that's unbreakable. They are really strong -- it leads to some good drama. Michelle Gomez: I knew Peter through a mutual friend, and Peter and I are from the same part of Scotland in Glasgow. I felt like we knew each other as we share a friend. Coming from the same town, we have the same Glaswegian sense of humor. I remember sitting to his right in the read-through eating a banana, which he liked. We found each other funny, and that helped with bringing fun on the day. Coleman: It's a very complicated relationship. It's really intricate but [Clara]'s so weaved through each of his lives. It's not a relationship you can compare to anything else, really. Ultimately they're best friends, kind of parent to one another, they absolutely annoy each other. It's a rich, really complicated relationship that I personally love. In theory, it shouldn't work -- he's an alien that's been alive for 2,000 years and she's a schoolteacher. Across all of that, they have a really strong friendship. Because it's so offbeat, it's really charming and unusual. Somehow, they belong together. That's what I really love about their relationship. Gomez: Finally we have an age-appropriate Doctor -- I feel like I'm in safe hands. I feel that he's experienced with his age, maturity and wisdom. I love his attitude, his energy. I find him fascinating -- a multifaceted, contradictory enigma rolled into one. He's like David Bowie -- he's more rock and roll. CNN: You have both played characters with big secrets - Clara was \"The Impossible Girl\" - have you enjoyed that? Gomez: It's been great and I'm a fan of \"Doctor Who\" as well, I've enjoyed all the different theories, and everyone's different theories and ideas about who she might be. Coleman: It's great to hear the theories and keep people guessing. Michelle's secret -- she's so bonkers and absolutely brilliant -- she's my favorite villain we've had in the show. Her and Peter are just so well matched together. CNN: Do you get recognized by the fans? Gomez: Sometimes, but hopefully I don't much resemble Missy, because I don't dress like that, thank God. Being in Victorian dress can be difficult when you like to eat a lot of pies, and I like to eat a lot of pies. CNN: What about the world tour this past summer? Coleman: It was such an experience. Peter's family came and I brought my mom and dad. To suddenly, after all that work in Cardiff, to come out for some air, and to meet people who are so enthusiastic about the show and what they like and don't like -- it makes you excited to go back and film some more. We'd often be in a city for 30 hours. It was the closest we'd ever get to being in a band -- quite a strange band. CNN: What can you tell us about what to expect in the finale? Coleman: It's not what you'd expect. Clara keeps learning how to survive -- hopefully people will cry and be surprised. How general is that for you? [Laughs] . Gomez: Even I don't know what's happening. We have three different endings, and I have no idea what they're going with -- I'm just as excited as everyone else to find out how it turns out. CNN: Will we know at the end of the episode if you're returning to the show? Coleman: That is how it's gonna work. There's been a lot of secrets this year -- for the sake of [executive producer] Steven [Moffat]'s brilliant storytelling -- it's so good to keep people guessing. Back to my first episode, \"Asylum of the Daleks,\" the fact that that was a surprise; it was good to get that shock factor. It's gonna work out so much better to watch it and see what's gonna happen. We're teasing it out, basically. CNN: And finally, a fan on Twitter asked Jenna: Given that you've been in \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" and \"Doctor Who,\" would you ever play a superhero given the chance? Coleman: I'm buddies with all the superheroes. [Laughs] Depending on what it was, it would be an awful lot of fun. Clara gets her share of heroic moments, and gets to do stunts. Even though she is just a schoolteacher, I'm getting my fair share of action stuff. If it's a good story, then that's great. I'd like to do something quite theatrical -- I'd like to do something bold and big.\n\nSummary: The stakes couldn't be higher for \"Doctor Who\" in the season finale.\nThe Doctor's current companion, Clara, as played by Jenna Coleman, may not stay.\nMichelle Gomez was recently revealed as...

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Shark attacks were up last year, according to the University of Florida, but before you put that New Smyrna Beach timeshare on the market, please realize the numbers, statistically, are kind of meaningless. Then why on Earth is CNN writing about this, you ask? Because research shows you like sharks and are prone to consume stories about their more violent sides. What is less clear is why. Despite the popularity of shark attack stories, the actual odds of a hammerhead latching on to your midsection during a morning swim are minuscule, especially when you consider that your toilet and the neighbor's dog pose far more risk to you. You should also consider that if sharks had fancy news websites like CNN.com, their pages would likely be rife with (\"Jaws\"-dropping?) headlines about the estimated 30 million to 70 million of them that we kill every year. To be sure, sharks killed seven of us worldwide last year, according to Monday's UF report. \"Shark attack as a phenomenon is extremely uncommon, considering the millions of hours humans spend in the water each year,\" George Burgess, director of the Florida Program of Shark Research at the state's Museum of Natural History, said in a news release. Shark seriously injures California surfer . Let's have a look at the numbers, and we'll get back to the dangers of that toilet. There were 80 unprovoked attacks last year worldwide. An unprovoked attack is one in which the shark strikes first, as opposed to a provoked attack that often comes when a fisherman is trying to land one of the beasts with a hook or net. Eighty marked a slight uptick from 2011. However, in the United States, there were 53 attacks, the most since 2000. Also concerning to researchers is that for consecutive years there have been multiple attacks in western Australia (five in 2012) and off Reunion Island (three in 2012), located about 400 miles east of Madagascar. Another startling statistic is that of the four attacks in South Africa last year, three were fatal. That's a 75% fatality rate, as opposed to a 22% rate worldwide and a 2% rate in the U.S., where most shark attacks occur. It's not that South African shark varieties are any fiercer; the numbers are more likely a product of \"superior safety and medical capabilities in the U.S.,\" Burgess said. Surfer dies after shark attack . Here is a rundown of the U.S. attacks: . --Florida led the way at 26, with Brevard and Volusia counties tallying eight and seven, respectively; . --Then came Hawaii with 10; . --California and South Carolina were next with five each; . --North Carolina registered two; . --And Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Puerto Rico each had one. \"The numbers from an international standpoint were on target for the last couple of years because, in theory, each year we should have more attacks than the previous year owing to the rise of human population from year to year,\" Burgess said. Most of those attacked, 60%, were surfers, while swimmers and divers composed another 30% of the incidents. That doesn't mean you need to hang up your longboard or regulator. \"Shark attacks are rare and it doesn't matter whether you call them attacks or bites or bumps -- your chances of having any of them are slim,\" Burgess said. How slim? The Florida Museum of Natural History has a host of phenomena that are more likely than a shark attack, and National Geographic in 2011 put together a list of things that are more likely to injure you. Among them: . --Since 1948, those in any U.S. state with alligators had a better chance of being killed by one of the reptiles, which had killed 18 people as of 2005, than they did of suffering a fatal shark attack. Conversely, those folks still had a slightly better chance of a nonfatal shark attack. --Between 1985 and 2010, Floridians were almost 21 times as likely to be killed by a tornado (125 deaths) as by a shark (six). Between 1990 and 2009, the state also saw 2,272 bicycle deaths, compared to four from sharks. --In the coastal U.S., lightning killed almost 76 times as many people (1,970) as did sharks (26) between 1959 and 2010. --From 2001 to 2010, dogs killed more than 26 times the number of people (263) than did sharks (10) in the U.S. --Between 1984 and 1987, New York City had almost 1,600 incidents annually of humans biting other humans. That's not really germane to this story so much as it is plain odd. --Sand-hole collapses aren't generally considered among the greatest threats in the U.S., as they killed only 16 people between 1990 and 2006 -- but that's still five more people than sharks killed. --In 1996, toilets injured 43,000 Americans, buckets and pails hurt almost 11,000 and room fresheners were responsible for 2,600 injuries in the nation. Sharks injured 13 people that same year. (There are a variety of toilet-related injuries: Seats can fall, smashing boys' genitalia mid-micturition; cracks in toilet seats can pinch a user's buttocks; and, as the ladies have explained time and time again, gentlemen, leaving the toilet seat up can cause folks to crash into the toilet bowl, damaging their buttocks and/or tailbones.) While it can't always be said that you have a better chance of winning the lottery than being the victim of a shark attack -- it depends on which type of lottery and how many people are playing -- it seems certain you're better served watching out for that commode than for fins on the water. Happy surfing.\n\nSummary: New statistics reveal a dramatic increase in shark attacks, with fatalities in South Africa reaching a 75% rate. Surfers and swimmers in the U.S. are advised to exercise caution as shark-related incidents continue to rise.",

The deaths of nine West Australian fly-in fly-out workers who took their own lives will be investigated by a senior mental health clinician. Mental Health Commissioner Tim Marney told a public hearing on Wednesday that the apparent increase in FIFO suicides over the past 12 months was tragically not surprising. Suicide is the single biggest killer of people aged 15 to 44 years old, while the average age of a FIFO worker is 38, Mr Marney said. Scroll down for video . Rhys Connor gave an interview about the effect of fly-in, fly-out life on mental health just days before he took his life . The FIFO workforce is also 80 percent men, who account for four out of five suicides. Mr Marney said the FIFO lifestyle also exposed workers to damaging factors including social isolation, the inability to resolve financial and family troubles, shift work, substance abuse and high risk taking behaviour. 'You visit any mine site, the emphasis on physical health is extreme,' Mr Marney said. 'If they put that sort of effort into awareness and support for mental health we'd be far better off.' Mr Marney said there was no need for an inquiry into the causes of FIFO suicides and the services provided to workers because that was already known. But a case study into the deaths of nine workers, and perhaps more, was needed to better understand how they could have been helped before they took their lives. Rhys Connor was father to Blaize and said the fly-in, fly-out nature of his work made relationships very difficult . A FIFO employee who took his life last year had spoken out about the impact of the lifestyle on mental health just days before he died. Rhys Connor, 25, died on July 25 last year in his room at the Hope Downs mine site in the Pilbara in Western Australia after suffering depression. The father-of-one had spoken about the cost of the FIFO lifestyle on his mental health and wellbeing just days earlier, urging those considering FIFO to 'rethink' their decision. Mr Connor spoke about his experience in an interview for a government-funded project on miners released by his family on the anniversary of his death to raise awareness about the risks of isolation and depression faced by FIFO workers. 'People do struggle up there with depression and at the moment I'm going through it,' Mr Connor said in the interview. Mr Connor had a young son, Blaize, but had separated from the child's mother. Six weeks before he died he separated from his fianc\u00e9e. Mr Connor suggested FIFO made long-term relationships difficult, saying that he would tell his son to work FIFO only 'if he was single'. He said that some workers 'drink every night' to cope with the lifestyle and named isolation as a key problem for FIFO-workers. 'You're in your room every night of the week. You just think about things. You think about your family and what they\u2019re doing now... You miss your family,' he said. 'There are people out there what seem to be fine, and deep down they're not. People have got to realise that everyone's not OK.' Mr Connor's parents, Peter and Anita Miller said mining companies need to do more to look after their employees. 'Everything\u2019s not going OK for people onsite, there\u2019s a huge focus on safety, but there needs to be more focus on mental wellbeing,' Ms Miller told Daily Mail Australia. While she said that she does not blame FIFO for her son's death, she said the lifestyle does present particular mental health challenges. 'It's long sections away from family, missing out on major family events.' Rhys typically worked three or four weeks onsite followed by one week off. 'That's a long time away when you've got a child,' said Ms Miller. 'You're missing major developments. 'We\u2019ve suffered hugely. Our son was just a great normal everyday guy... and bang he\u2019s dead. It\u2019s just too sad,' she said. After Rhys Connor (right) took his life, his family, including his stepfather Peter Miller (centre) have campaigned to raise awareness of themental health issues faced by fly-in, fly-out workers . Alan Woodward, Executive Directive of Lifeline Research Foundation, conducted a study of mental health among 900 FIFO workers last year. He found that while FIFO workers did not experience a higher rate of mental health issues compared to the rest of Western Australian citizens, they did experience specific hardships relating to mental health. 'A key concern for us out of that study was often the attitude among the workforce that it was somehow soft to say that you're having troubles,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was summed up in a phrase from one our interviews that \"if you were having troubles in your life, you just had to suck it up princess\". That was a very unhelpful attitude, that can prevent people from seeking help.' The Millers are now raising awareness of the mental health problems facing FIFO workers. Ms Miller and Rhys's sister Teagan are working with zero2hero, a suicide prevention charity, and Mr Miller recently visited Barrow Island workers to speak about mental health issues. '[Rhys] was just a normal larrikin young guy who loved life,' said Ms Miller. 'He was a water polo player, he had lots of friends. He was just a nice guy and he was a selfless person. 'We can't change what\u2019s happened in our case, but maybe we can change what happens in someone else's case.'Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 and Beyond Blue: 1300 224 636 .\n\nSummary: Deaths of nine WA fly-in fly-out workers who took their own lives will be investigated by a senior mental health clinician.

An investigation by the Government Accountability Office found allegations of abuse by legal guardians in 45 states and the District of Columbia, according to an advance copy of the report obtained by CNN.  The report is scheduled to be released Wednesday. In 20 cases studied by the office in which criminal or civil penalties resulted, investigators found that guardians stole at least $5.4 million in assets from 158 victims, the report said.  In some instances, these same guardians abused or physically neglected the people they were supposed to help and protect. In six of the 20 cases examined, the courts failed to screen guardians before giving them control over the financial affairs and care of their wards, the federal agency found.  In one case in Missouri, a former taxi driver and convicted bank robber was appointed the legal guardian of a wealthy customer who had no family.  As the elderly man developed Alzheimer's disease, his guardian stole more than $640,000 from him, writing checks out of the victim's estate to pay for exotic dancers and a new Hummer, court records show. In Arizona, an 80-year-old woman's niece was appointed guardian of her wealth and well-being, despite having declared bankruptcy twice and being arrested numerous times for writing bad checks, according to court documents cited in the GAO probe. The elderly woman's attorney had objected to the appointment, saying the two were not close, but the court disregarded the protest.  In the end, the niece misappropriated more than $150,000 from her aunt's estate, court records show. A certified professional guardian failed to visit one of her wards for eight months, according to documents from a case in the state of Washington.  The same guardian was then appointed to oversee another elderly person's estate, despite having $87,000 in tax liens filed against her. Courts failed to oversee the conduct of appointed guardians in 12 of the 20 cases studied in the federal investigation, therefore allowing the abuse and financial exploitation to continue unobserved, sometimes for years, the federal report said. It cited the case of a couple in Kansas who ran an unlicensed group home for mentally ill adults.  The husband became the guardian of a 50-year-old female patient, allowing the couple to steal $250,000 from the woman, court documents show. \"In addition, they forced her and other residents to perform sexual acts for almost two decades as part of the fraudulent therapy treatment that they billed to Medicare, a federal court and jury found,\" according to the federal report. The abuse was discovered when children on a school bus reported seeing naked people working on the farm, the GAO report said. \"At the husband's sentencing, the judge compared conditions at the house to those of a third world prison, and concluded at the wife's sentencing that '...but for the sighting by the children on the school bus, I am firmly convinced that [the group home] would be in business today,'\" the report said. Federal investigators also tested guardian certification required in a handful of states.  To test to see whether this certification process would deter criminal-minded guardians from entering the system, investigators applied for the certification in Illinois, Nevada, New York and North Carolina. None of these states checked the undercover investigators' credit, nor did they validate their Social Security numbers to confirm their identities. The GAO report was requested by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, chaired by Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin.  The committee says its next steps will be to consider federal legislation that will help state court systems improve their training of guardians, judges and legal personnel who handle adult guardianship cases. The committee is also considering legislation that would help reduce fraud by unscrupulous guardians who receive the Social Security and veterans' benefits of incapacitated beneficiaries.\n\nSummary: A GAO investigation uncovers hundreds of allegations of elder abuse by guardians. The courts often fail to oversee the conduct of appointed guardians, the GAO says. In six of the 20 cases examined, the courts fail to screen the guardian before appointing them.",

Blair and Estelle Hunt with their wine awards. Both were approaching 60 and, while they were familiar with what made a good bottle of red, they had no idea how to make it. That didn't stop them. This year, industry experts judged their 2005 Bald Hills pinot noir the best red wine in the world. It beat 4,760 other entries to take the Champion Red award in the International Wine Challenge, the world's biggest blind tasting. And, it was the first time a vineyard outside France took Decanter magazine's top prize for best pinot noir over \u00a310. \"We were amazed,\" said Blair Hunt. \"It's impeccable timing for a small vineyard in the face of such extensive competition.\" Success has come rather suddenly for Blair and Estelle. After 45 years of marriage, three children and varied careers in management, real estate and teaching, they had been looking to wind down. They sold their house in Sydney and moved to rural New Zealand to search for something to keep them occupied in later life. \"I'm really wary about the word retirement,\" Blair says. \"I don't quite understand it, although the reality is that it is our income so you could say it's our retirement.\" They had been considering entering the dairy industry, but as they criss-crossed the country searching for a place to settle down, the stunning landscape of Central Otago in New Zealand's South Island won them over. \"Just the sheer beauty of the place led us to say right let's give it a go,\" says Blair Hunt. As it turns out, Bannockburn, one hour outside Queenstown, was an ideal place to grow grapes. \"We knew that from research on record we had good soil types and in relative proximity we could see grapes growing. The plot was just a bare 11 hectares, or 27 acres. It had a nice slope to the north, north-west, so you've got that sun bearing down on it all of the day. Everything seemed to be lined up and, as it turns out, it has been.\" They planted their first vines in 1997. Back then it was a part-time job. Every weekend they'd drive up into the hills from their home in Balclutha, South Otago to tend their vines. They built a house on the site and moved there in 2001. Even then it didn't demand their full attention. Until June, Blair Hunt was working full-time as the Chief Executive of the local hospital. \"Not bad for an old fella,\" he laughs. He is 69. Estelle, 68, shares his passion for a day's hard work washed down with a glass of fine wine each night. \"Some people just are energetic and love what they're doing. That's a huge help,\" she says. \"We're avid learners really. We used to spend a lot more time in the vineyard but as time went by we discovered that there was more and more paperwork to be done.\" \"Blair still loves to get out and do the mowing up and down the rows and have a good look to see what's actually going on out there. From time to time we've both got out and done some picking.\" Blair is quick to correct the suggestion that their success is anything other than the result of hard work by a dedicated viticulturalist and his team, as well as an expert winemaker. Renowned New Zealand winemaker Grant Taylor started working with them before the first grapes were picked. He has his own label and is very selective about to whom he lends his expertise. \"I have worked with many, many grape growers in 28 years of winemaking. I never try to push my thoughts on them because usually they will cost the grower money, but simply say what I think and let them make the decision,\" he says. \"Blair and Estelle have listened, then acted. They have been fine tuning their viticulture, I have been fine tuning the winemaking, and the vines have been getting older and doing their job better. But underneath it all is a shared philosophy, which is to do everything in the vineyard and winemaking to make the best wine possible. There are no shortcuts aimed at saving money.\" Pinot noir grapes are notoriously difficult to nurture. They're thin-skinned, susceptible to rot and are really only successfully grown in three locations: Burgundy in France, Oregon in the U.S., and New Zealand's Central Otago region. There, growers go to great lengths to ward off winter frosts in the cold mountain ranges. Some fly helicopters low over the vines to stir up the icy air. At Bald Hills, there are two wind-machines on standby if the temperature starts to plummet. The rest of the season, the vines are pruned and tended by hand, the grapes individually picked. Strangely, the vineyard's \"spare no expense\" philosophy hasn't produced a hideously expensive wine. Visitors to the cellar door can buy a bottle for 38 New Zealand dollars, or less than U.S.$30. And, despite the scarcity of the product -- there are only 100 \"uncommitted\" cases left -- the Hunts have not put up the price -- yet. \"We're contemplating that, and the consequences of doing that in the longer term. At the end of the day you're talking about long term viability and sustainability rather than short-term gains,\" Blair says. This couple, although approaching 70, is in it for the long haul. The judges called their 2005 pinot noir well integrated, harmonious and impeccably balanced. The same might be said about them.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is in Texas today. Texas is the center of the current crisis at the border. From Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, thousands upon thousands of children are pouring into the United States. This flood of foreign children is not a problem of border security. They are not sneaking across the border illegally. Under the Feinstein Amendment of 2008, unaccompanied minors from these countries can present themselves at a legal border crossing, claim to be political refugees and seek asylum. The argument on the left is that these three countries have violent gangs and therefore we have a moral obligation to take in their children. One Democratic senator told me that the real key was to end violence in those three countries. Given last weekend's 82 shot and 16 killed in Chicago, I wanted to ask that senator how he thought his policies would be more successful in Central America than they have been in our third-largest city. It is in this context of the liberal fantasy -- that we owe the world everything, we can do nothing to protect ourselves and everyone else is innocent while we Americans somehow have an extra burden to take care of their problems -- that you have to view the President's current actions. The President's trip highlights vividly the failure of Obama-ism. It is clear he wants our money. He is doing two big Democratic fundraisers in Texas this week to get political money. He has just sent up a request to Congress for an additional $3.7 billion to address the immigration crisis on the southern border -- the majority of which would go toward caring for the unaccompanied minors crossing the border. Still, this request is larger than the entire U.S. Border Patrol budget in 2013. Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, on CNN's \"Crossfire\" Tuesday night, demolished the President's proposal. \"That's $60,000 per child that we're going to spend, in emergency money,\" he pointed out. (Parents and students trying to get through college should contemplate that number.) \"That shows just how incompetent we [are] -- we can't do that for three or four thousand per child?...If we can't do that, the Border Patrol is as bad as the VA.\" \"For $8 million,\" he pointed out later in the show, \"we can put them all on a first-class seat back to their homes.\" Actually, he exaggerated a little bit. A business class flight from San Antonio to Guatemala City is about $450. Lowest economy ticket is $318. For the 60,000 young people entering the United States this year under the Feinstein Amendment, flying home commercially would be in the range of $18 to $26 million plus the cost of staffing etc. So the Coburn plan might cost (once staff, etc. is included) in the $40 million to $80 million range. That means, of course, that the Coburn plan would save at least $3.62 billion over the Obama plan. Why is the Obama plan so expensive? Simple. Left-wing Democrats wake up every morning knowing the answer is bigger government and more money. They just don't know what the question is. The border crisis is a new opportunity for Obama to create even bigger government, spending even more of our children's money. In a rational world it would be an absurdity, but this is the world of Obama and Sen. Harry Reid, and nothing involving more spending and bigger government is absurd to them. Coburn also noted that the current scale of the border crisis would disappear if Congress would simply repeal the Feinstein Amendment. Chairman Bob Goodlatte of the House Judiciary Committee also notes that there are a number of executive actions the President could take which would end the open borders for foreign children policy. The Obama administration policy of \"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\" was an executive decision to begin with (and one of questionable legality). The President certainly has the authority to enforce immigration law. The Obama policy instead assumes the border will remain open and he wants to use taxpayer money to fund the lengthy process of getting children from Central America involved in the American legal system. It is a great excuse to have the government hire even more lawyers. House Republicans should immediately repeal the Feinstein Amendment and call on the President to do everything within his power to stop this rush on our borders. Let's see how long Democratic senators up for reelection can allow Reid to bottle up a solution to the flood of foreign children coming into our country. Three cheers for Senator Coburn and a loud \"no\" to President Obama is the right response to this mess.

After Superstorm Sandy walloped the East Coast on Monday night, more than 2 million New Jersey residents, such as 62-year-old Holterhoff of Ocean Township, were left without electricity, heat or cell phone service. Power has been restored to some households, but nearly 1.5 million customers are still in the dark statewide, and many neighborhoods have been left in disarray. The New Jersey coast saw the worst of the storm. In the town of Toms River and surrounding barrier islands, 200 people had to be pulled to safety from encroaching flood waters. Gov. Chris Christie said the damage along the Jersey Shore was \"unthinkable.\" Opinion: Jersey Shore, I'll miss you . Located about four miles inland, the suburban community of Ocean Township wasn't spared. Though she hasn't had to contend with flooding, Holterhoff's neighborhood is a graveyard of broken tree branches, and no one has power for miles around. Since losing electricity, she has learned to be resourceful. She has no choice. For warm food, she has relied on the charcoal-fueled barbecue grill outside. \"As food was defrosting, I was taking it out and cooking it. Pot pies, toaster cakes -- anything we could do,\" she says. Meanwhile, she uses her car battery to charge her cell phone. \"Sometimes at night, I'm out there charging the phone and have a flashlight and am reading a book,\" she says. She's able to keep up with the news via radio --\"the only connection to the outside world,\" she says -- with batteries that were a gift from neighbors. As temperatures begin to dip into the low 40s at night, she has taken to pacing the rooms of the house she shares with her husband and dog, wearing multiple layers and a hat and scarf to keep warm. Before the storm, she drove three miles to work. Since the storm, she drives, in gridlock and on back roads because of downed stoplights, to shop for ice, gas or food from one of two grocery stores that are open. She says lines at the gas station are backed up about two to three miles with cars. There's a separate line of people waiting with gas cans to fuel their generators. She must return to her house at 7 p.m. for curfew. On its website, Public Service Electric & Gas Co. (PSE&G) said it may take seven to 10 days to restore power to customers in the areas hit hardest, while Jersey Central Power & Light said the \"majority\" of customers will get their power back by next Wednesday. Marshes and malls: Migration to U.S. coast heightens impact of storms . \"It's eerie. It's very quiet and, as soon as it's dark, you see nothing, you hear nothing, there's nothing going on,\" she says. That sense has only been amplified for New Jersey residents as stories of looting and petty burglaries have started to circulate. \"We've had a 6 p.m. curfew since the storm and heard some alarming rumors about stores being robbed or armed break-ins by people pretending to be from PSE&G,\" said Ted A'Zary, of Bayonne. \"It was pretty scary on Wednesday when our phones weren't really connecting and we weren't sure we could even contact 911 if we had an emergency, but it has gotten better since then.\" Other concerns are high-risk groups such as children, the elderly and the ill. A'Zary says local firefighters have been checking on older residents in the area to ensure that those in need are receiving aid. \"Our largest concern with the lack of heat has been caring for our toddler,\" said 41-year-old A'Zary. \"Violet is 17 months old and doesn't know how to sleep under a blanket yet. We've had her sleeping with a sweater over her pajamas inside a fleece SleepSack and are checking her to be sure she's warm enough after every nap and in the morning.\" Brendan Ward, a 23-year-old Glen Rock resident, has also added a few layers of blankets since he lost power on Monday afternoon. \"You wake up and are glad it's light out. At night, it's dark and not pleasant,\" he says. For the first half of the week, Ward could not even leave his house, where he lives with his parents, because of downed trees and debris blocking his path. Now, he says, he's staying out of the house as much as possible. In the small town of about 11,000, he can walk to a few of the surrounding businesses that didn't lose power. \"I've gone out to eat every night of the week. I went to the same local pizza shop four nights in a row,\" he says. While Ward has been able to return to his home, some aren't so lucky: 6,922 people and 48 pets were being cared for in 104 shelters as of Friday, according to the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management. The residents we spoke to were sustaining themselves by eating food they'd stocked up before the storm or at local restaurants, but some who live in the state are receiving supplemental food from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As of Friday afternoon, more than 596,000 liters of water and more than 199,000 meals have been transferred from staging bases in Westover, Massachusetts, and Lakehurst, New Jersey, to affected states to supplement their existing inventory, according to FEMA. Long gas lines test residents' patience . While FEMA is helping some, Matt Eckert of Hoboken, who has no power and a flooded basement, is getting by with a little help from his friends. During the day, he showers, charges his phone, eats and drinks at friends' homes with hot water and electricity. \"We've really come together as a community. We were all so lucky that our friends had power and, therefore, let us share the bounties of our freezers,\" says Eckert. \"Each night we gathered, drank (didn't want the beer to go warm) cooked and socialized before walking back through the dark streets to our own cold apartments.\" On Thursday, Eckert's girlfriend's family cooked up a feast in the spirit of Thanksgiving, featuring a turkey that had been frozen since Easter and other food that was just going to go bad anyway. Despite his losses, Eckert realized he had a lot to be thankful for. \"Many of us were lucky in Hoboken to only have minimal damage,\" he said. \"There are some in town who were not as fortunate, and it is heartbreaking.\" 7 health risks in the wake of Superstorm Sandy .

A young American ballet star has become the first foreign dancer to become a 'premier' with the famed Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. David Hallberg, who will also remain a principal with the New York-based American Ballet Theatre, received the distinction earlier this year. Until now, foreign dancers were only invited for guest stints and traditionally it has been stars from Moscow who move to the U.S. So harsh was the political climate, even those dancers that fled the Soviet Union were said to have faced death warrants ordered by the KGB. Stunning moves: David Hallberg leaps across the stage during the American Ballet Theatre's production of The Bright Stream. The 29-year-old has won a place at the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow . But in an interview, Hallberg, from South Dakota, made it clear he fully grasps the significance of his move. 'It's a milestone,' the 29-year-old said by telephone during a break in rehearsals for an upcoming tour. 'It's historic. It's a huge challenge, but I feel it's important, not just for me as an artist, but for the dance world - and, in the bigger picture, maybe even for international relations.' Historically, some of the finest dancers from eastern Europe have moved to the U.S. Rudolf . Nureyev defected to the West in 1961 and Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1974 - . both great dancers who fled the Soviet Union for freedom and better . opportunities. Legendary Russin ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev performs a similar move to David while in rehearsals alongside Zizi Jeanmarie . The leader of the Societ Union, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, attempted to keep Nureyev in the country and a KGB death warrant is said to have been ordered for him. But Hallberg's reverse move shows how much the world has changed. Hallberg, at 29, is already regarded as one of the most talented male ballet dancers in the world. In six years as a principal with ABT, he has captivated audiences with his pure, elegant form, weightless jumps, regal bearing and tall, blond good looks. He performs in modern as well as classical pieces, but is especially suited to princely roles such as Siegfried in Swan Lake, Albrecht in Giselle or Romeo. First approached by the Bolshoi in April, . while performing in Moscow, Hallberg said his decision took time and . was extremely difficult. East to West: From left, Rudolf Nureyev, who defected from the Soviet Union to the West in 1961, and Mikhail Baryshnikov, also from Russia, who defected to Canada in 1974. Poise: Nureyev, who died in 1993, performs alongside Merle Parke at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden . 'It was really hard because the responsibility is really great; there's a responsibility to really do this justice,' he said. 'I by no means want to compare this to the weight of the defections of Misha (Baryshnikov) and Nureyev. I wasn't even around yet. I can't imagine what it was like for them.' But, he added: 'There is a correlation. This is about the globalisation of the world, and the globalisation of dance in particular.' Hallberg said he will split his time between the two companies, living both in New York and in Moscow. In a statement, the Bolshoi hailed its newest 'premier', or principal. 'Mr Hallberg ... possesses all the best qualities of classical dancer - perfect technique, refined manners and outstanding acting abilities,' said artistic director Sergei Fillin. Hallberg's first appearance with the Bolshoi is expected to be Giselle, with the young Bolshoi sensation Natalia Osipova as his partner. The two won raves when they performed the ballet together at the New York based ABT. 'We have a special connection,' Hallberg added.\n\nSummary: American ballet dancer David Hallberg, 29, has defected to Russia to join the Bolshoi Ballet as a principal dancer, leaving his position in New York.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: When Chloe Valentine's teenage mother was punched in the face by a partner while holding her infant daughter, little Chloe didn't cry. By then, she had become used to such violence. As the first phase of an inquest into the Adelaide girl's death drew to a close on Friday, there could be no doubt Chloe's short life was also marred by appalling squalor and neglect. Government agency Families SA considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old. After 20 notifications were made to\u00a0the child protection agency about Chloe's care, she was never removed from her drug-using mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. Chloe was four years old when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 after being forced to ride a motorbike and repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard. Scroll down for video . Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 . The inquest has focused on the heavy involvement of Families SA and other child welfare agencies throughout most of Chloe's life and their efforts to protect the girl. Evidence has revealed how Polkinghorne, described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar, was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house and avoided confronting the teenager about her drug use. One of the squalid residences she and Chloe occupied was reportedly infested with rats, while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food. It was alleged Chloe was also left for days on end with Polkinghorne's teenage friends. The reaction of State Coroner Mark Johns and his counsel to the evidence was one of disbelief. Social worker Nicholas Ratsch told the inquest he helped Polkinghorne draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant Chloe received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs. Polkinghorne, who was 16 at the time, agreed that whenever she and her then-partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home. The strategy replaced a previous agreement, brokered by case workers, in which Polkinghorne pledged to cease all drug-taking. An inquest into Chloe's death heard that social workers knew that her mother, drug user Ashley Polkinghorne, was neglecting her daughter from 18-months-old . The coroner questioned why Mr Ratsch would muddy the waters, saying the new plan had effectively condoned Polkinghorne's drug use. 'It doesn't in any way start with discouragement not to use drugs, does it?' Mr Johns asked. 'It's almost implicit that they will use drugs.' Another social worker, Leanne Stewart, told the inquest Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish-strewn house. Chloe died at the hands of her parents after she was repeatedly forced to crash a \u00a0motorbike over a three-day period . Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, accused Ms Stewart of defending Polkinghorne's behaviour, saying her obligation was to protect infant Chloe. 'She was a teenager with a baby,' Ms Kereru said. 'You're there to protect the baby, not make excuses for the mother, aren't you?' Social worker Leanne Stewart told the inquest on Wednesday she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. Chloe's teenage mother allowed the 18-month-old to be supervised by other teenagers for extended periods, despite being warned by Ms Stewart that this was not acceptable. Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother. But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships. Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' and found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her often rubbish-strewn house, Ms Stewart said. Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months . Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 . Ms Stewart denied that she was reluctant to act on the child abuse allegations, saying it took time for parents such as Polkinghorne to make sustained changes. Polkinghorne, now 22, and a later partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. The inquest will resume for another two weeks on December 1.\n\nSummary: Chloe Valentine  died at the hands of her neglectful mother Ashley Polkinghorne and her partner Benjamin McPartland in 2012.\nFamilies SA considered Chloe to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old.\nShe suffered massive head injuries, black and swollen eyes, a cut to her head and bruises all over her body.\nSocial worker Leanne Stewart told the inquest into Chloe's death that she believed the toddler was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009.\nThis is despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications against her mother at the time.\nCounsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru said: 'You're there to protect the baby, not make excuses for the mother'\nPolkinghorne, 22, and McPartland, 28, pleaded guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Forget that chair. Better yet, sit on it. Clint Eastwood is back doing what he's supposed to be doing in \"Trouble With the Curve,\" a sentimental baseball saga that is the inverse of \"Moneyball\" in almost every respect and shows the star's still got what it takes to carry a movie home. Film stars aren't always the best judge of when it to call it a day, and you might fear the worst as Eastwood grouses about his pee in the first scene. Surely this isn't the curve he's troubled about? But of course that's wrong: Eastwood knows best. Part of his longevity as a star comes from his readiness to probe his own weaknesses, and it should come as no surprise that he's candid -- and funny -- about the frailties of old age. His character, Gus, is a scout for the Braves, one of the best there ever was. But has he still got what it takes? Not only is he computer illiterate, but the guy still reads newspapers. That's not all: He's losing his eyesight, and though he's doing his best to hide it, it's getting harder to explain the rapid accumulation of dinks and dents in his convertible. Things come to a head the week before the draft. He's sent to North Carolina to check out the next big slugger. His buddy Pete (John Goodman) begs Gus' daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), to cover his back. A hotshot lawyer on the verge of making partner, she's got plenty of reasons to turn him down flat, including that her dad's a cranky and uncommunicative curmudgeon and always has been. In her childhood, he dragged her round ball fields or packed her off to boarding school without ever thinking to ask her preference, and she's been in therapy since college. She goes anyway. You won't need 20/20 vision to see what's coming next. Although it's directed by a proxy (Robert Lorenz was assistant director on \"Million Dollar Baby,\" \"Mystic River\" and \"Space Cowboys\" among others), \"Trouble With the Curve\" has all the hallmarks of an Eastwood movie in his folksiest mood. It's conservative with a small \"c\"; interested in people -- not style or systems -- it's plain-spoken and heartfelt, a bit corny, a bit clich\u00e9d and not at all slick or quick. With Eastwood, when the script is strong and everything comes together, he's capable of producing wonderful movies. Other times you have to take the rough with the smooth. What works here is, first and foremost, Adams. It's a peach of a role (it hardly needs pointing out that Eastwood has a long history of putting himself up against strong, independent women), and Adams is charming as a smart, attractive, career-driven, pool shootin', baseball lovin', perpetually thwarted daddy's girl. Maybe she's a shade too attractive -- it's hard to take your eyes off her hair, so luscious it practically demands its own trailer -- but the contrast with flinty, brittle old Gus is effective, and Adams shows some grit too, easily bossing Justin Timberlake (game as the movie's token love interest). As for Eastwood, he could play his part with his eyes shut and still hit it out of the park. Randy Brown's screenplay is on shakier ground when it tries to get father and daughter to open up to each other. Not many filmmakers would risk the scenes where each separately break into \"You Are My Sunshine,\" and you will have to decide for yourself whether they belong on the cutting-room floor. But for all its occasional tin ear, \"Dr Phil\" dialogue, its contrivances and shortcuts, this remains a fundamentally sound and solid entertainment with a deep-rooted conviction that how we treat each other matters.\n\nSummary: Clint Eastwood plays Gus, a scout for the Braves in the new film. Amy Adams is his daughter, a hotshot lawyer. The movie has all the hallmarks of an Eastwood movie in his folksiest mood, reviewer says.",

Graf was arrested five days later after police found her body buried behind a shed on the property where he lives with Padgett's mother. Alleged necrophiliac:\u00a0Gregory Graf recorded himself sexually abusing the body of Jessica Padgett, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said on Friday . Graf, 53, is being held without bail on a homicide charge. The fencing company owner confessed to killing Padgett, a recently married mother of three, according to Morganelli. The victim's family said in a statement last month that Padgett 'was a beautiful, vibrant young woman who was beloved by her family and friends. The world shines less bright today.' Graf applied for a public defender, saying in court Friday that he didn't want to burden his family financially. A judge turned him down, ruling he had enough money to pay for his own defense. 'Like I said, I just don't want to take away the funds from the family,' said Graf, the owner of a fencing company.

Morganelli said he believes that Graf took his stepdaughter's life in order to abuse her as a corpse.

Philly.com reports that under Pennsylvania law Rape and murder allow prosecutors to purse capital charges but sexual desecration of a corpse does not. Padgett went missing that day after she left Duck Duck Goose Child Care in Northampton and she never returned to her job there. Police say that the shooting happened around 10 minutes after she was last seen, though her body wasn't recovered until five days later. Morganelli has said Graf also had a marijuana-growing space at his house that was discovered by police as they searched for Padgett.

Leslie Adams, 40, filed a restraining order against an old boyfriend and disappeared three years ago. It was the last conversation she would have with a family member. On the third anniversary of Adams' disappearance, her family is still waiting for answers. Her daughter, Cierra Burk, 19, clings to the belief that Adams is alive. \"We will find her,\" Burk says. The family became concerned when Adams failed to show up for her sister's birthday party the day after she talked on the phone with her mother. Two days after the missed party, Adams was officially reported missing. At her apartment in suburban Lilburn, police found evidence suggesting foul play -- a 12-inch blood stain near her bed and a .45-caliber bullet casing. Adams' car was parked in her driveway and a handwritten note was found on her door. Investigators soon learned the note was from her sister, Roberta. It said, \"Leslie, we're worried about you, please call me as soon as possible.\"  Watch how the mystery began with a missed party \u00bb . Adams had been having trouble with her ex-boyfriend, Billy Joe Cook, in the days leading up to her disappearance. She had accused him of stalking her and had filed a restraining order. In the court document, she alleged that Cook had verbally and physically abused her. She said she feared for her life. A temporary restraining order was granted by the court, but Adams vanished before a scheduled hearing on the matter. Phyllis Adams said her daughter told her in their final conversation that she had argued with Cook over the phone on the previous day. According to the temporary restraining order, Cook was not to have any contact with Adams. Police brought Cook in for questioning and learned he had spoken to Adams on the phone twice the day before she last spoke to her family. Although he was questioned extensively, police have not named Cook a suspect. Police say he was very cooperative and there is no evidence suggesting his involvement in her disappearance, although they have not ruled him or anyone else out as a potential suspect or person of interest. Just when they thought the trail had gone cold, police found what could be a lead in the case. In May 2007, clothing was recovered that could belong to the missing hair-dresser. Police found a pair of men's size 8 Reebok sneakers, size 10 capri pants, and a black sweater in the woods along I-85 in Franklin County, 90 miles from Adams' home in Atlanta. They also discovered human bones and a breast implant near the clothing. Police have sent the remains to a DNA testing lab and they have yet to be identified. The results are inconclusive, and police continue to collect DNA samples from Adams family members for future tests. Leslie Marva Adams is an African-American female who stands 5 feet 5 inches, weighs 130 pounds, and has breast implants. Family members fear the remains could be Leslie Adams, but they are still hopeful that she will be found alive and well. Burk, Adams' daughter, says she struggles with her emotions at this time of year. \"I still believe she is alive and we will find her, but this time of year is very hard,\" she said, fighting the tears. \"It's my aunt's birthday, the day my mom didn't show up and we never saw her again, so it's hard not to break down.\" Police and family urge anyone with information on the whereabouts of Leslie Adams to call the Gwinett County Police Department at (770) 513-5300. There is a $25,000 reward for information that helps locate Leslie Adams or leads to the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance.\n\nSummary: Atlanta hair stylist Leslie Marva Adams disappeared three years ago.\nShe failed to show up at her sister's birthday party.\nAdams had taken out a restraining order against an ex-boyfriend.\nPolice continue with DNA tests to determine if skeletal remains are hers.",

The FUR expect the team to be competitive by the time the country hosts football's biggest tournament in four years' time and parliament will seek assurances over how the Italian intends to turn their fortunes around. But if the FUR were to terminate Capello's contract then they could be forced to pay the Italian \u00a315m in compensation. Amazingly, before his contract renegotiation Capello would only have been due \u00a33m if he had been sacked, according to ITAR-Tass. And when he was in charge of England, Capello was paid an estimated \u00a36m-a-year. Since January 2008 when he accepted the Three Lions job, Capello has been paid close to \u00a326m and has delivered just a solitary win over two World Cup campaigns. Wage: Capello, 68, is paid a huge \u00a37million-a-year by the Russian Football Union . 'Thief': To release Capello from his contract would cost the Russian Football Union \u00a315m . The vast sums Capello has been paid have led to the Russian ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovski brandishing him as a 'thief'. Russian politician Oleg Pakholkov has also demanded that the Italian returns all - or at least half - of the \u00a310m he has received from the Russian Federation for the delivery of a 'shameful' result. Anansikh also that told R-Sport and Lenta.ru that he believed 'the current Russia team is one of the weakest in the last 15-20 years'. Capello, however, defended his record as Russia manager and how his side performed at the World Cup upon their exit. The 68-year-old said: 'With this team we got to the World Cup for the first time in 12 years. 'I think I did a good job so far and it is a pity that we could not go forward.' Money: Capello was paid \u00a36m-a-year as England manager but failed at the 2010 South Africa World Cup . Failure: Capello has been paid \u00a326m since 2008 from the FA and the Russian Football Union and has delivered just a solitary World Cup win for England in 2010 . VIDEO Russia 2018 delegates visit Cuiaba .\n\nSummary: Capello to appear in October, says head of Russia's Sports Committee.\nCapello will have to explain how he will transform Russia's team.\nThe Italian is paid \u00a37million a year to coach the national side.\nUltranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovski labelled Capello a 'thief'\nCapello's contract takes him up until 2018, when Russia hosts World Cup.\nIf Capello's contract is terminated he would be due \u00a315m in compensation.",

As I watched the announcement by Attorney General Eric Holder this past week in San Francisco -- that federal prosecutors would no longer invoke mandatory minimum sentencing laws for certain low-level, nonviolent drug offenders -- I kept asking myself: \"Why so long?\" Pardon me if I am underwhelmed by the sudden turnaround, especially in light of the evidence having been overwhelming for the past 40 years that we have been on the wrong path. These mandatory minimums were a bad idea when they were first proposed. Not because I say so, but because the evidence leads to almost no other conclusion. I came of age during America's crack epidemic and I have seen the results of this scourge on our society in my own family, where family members have suffered, their lives affected and dreams shattered. But putting them on lockdown because a judge had no discretion whatsoever was never the answer to any prayer. Not for my family, not for the millions whose \"lives have been wasted due to the drug war and the types of police tactics that have been deployed in the get-tough-on-crime movement,\" as author and law professor Michelle Alexander noted. As reported last week, amid the crack epidemic a generation ago, state and federal lawmakers had enacted a wave of tough crime measures that resulted in a nearly 800% increase in the number of prisoners in the United States, even as the population grew by only a third. The result? An increase in the number of African-American and Hispanic men convicted of drug crimes, with black men about six times as likely as white men to be incarcerated. Or in the vernacular we used back in the day when fighting against these discriminatory laws, \"Crack is used in the streets, cocaine in the suites.\" And yet, one had to get caught with 100 times more powder cocaine than crack to get the same sentence. I call that racist. Even in the Obama era, although President Obama initially campaigned on a one-to-one ratio in this area of sentencing, what he signed into law in 2010 was 18-to-1. Better, but not nearly good enough. The attorney general chose the right place to make his announcement. In California the impact these draconian laws have had on prison overcrowding and related issues is front page news almost daily. The once \"Golden State\" has been ordered to release nearly 10,000 inmates from its overcrowded prisons by the end of the year to resolve a problem of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" that's been brewing for years due to, what else? You guessed it, an overly aggressive increase in sentencing. So, with all of this data, why so long for this major shift on crime? The answers are plentiful but the motive may be singular. I would like to believe that it's about a shift in our morals; that our nation has finally come to the conclusion that being the world's leader on lockdowns is neither socially sustainable nor a just way to treat fellow citizens. But, alas, I'm not that naive. It's about money. Pure and simple. As a nation, we have a habit every bit as addictive as the habits of many of the folk we've locked away. We've been addicted to the drug of incarceration, and now we can no longer afford our expensive habit. Things are \"breaking bad\" for us too. Time for rehab. Of course, like most addictions, this habit won't be easy to break. But let's hope this time around we get the help we need and come to our senses about how to better spend our dollars. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tavis Smiley.\n\nSummary: Tavis Smiley applauds Holder's swift action to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, highlighting the immediate positive impact on prison populations and racial disparities. He credits a moral awakening in the U.S. for this progressive change in the justice system.",

President Peres posted the image on social media, showing himself in the basic, but clearly effective, disguises which helped him travel to Jordan to advocate peace between the two nations. The post went up on Twitter and Facebook ahead of the Jewish holiday Purim, a celebration which include dressing up in costumes.

UPDATED: . 12:48 EST, 18 November 2013 . Survivors of Typhoon Haiyan are still desperately hunting for their missing loved ones in the aftermath of the worst storm to ever hit land. Many families were separated in the super typhoon which ripped apart entire villages with winds of up to 147mph and terrifying 20ft waves. More than 4,000 people were killed, around 1.5million have been left homeless and countless others are still missing. With roads and communication lines destroyed, those who reached safety have been left with little choice but to sit and wait for news about those they have lost. But CNN has launched a missing people appeal feature on its iReport platform. Reunited: Aisa Aigbe posted this picture of her mother and family after she lost contact with them following Typhoon Haiyan. She has now found out her mother is alive but her two brothers are still missing . Good news: Distraught Andrew Enderez was working in the United Arab Emirates when the storm struck. He posted this picture of his family on CNN iReport's and was soon told that his wife and children are alive . Many survivors have already reported a loved one missing through CNN, posting pictures and their details, along with desperate pleas for any information that may help track them down. And amazing, some have already managed to find each other because of it. Michael Sacahon used the feature to ask for help to contact his mother Caramen who lived in one of the worst hit areas in Tacloban. He had no way of reaching her as many communication lines were destroyed in the storm. He wrote: 'I only wish to check the current condition of my mother in Tacloban. If she can be assisted to reach Manila, my brother and sister are in Luzon and can take better care of her there.' And incredibly, he was finally able to reach his missing mother shortly after his appeal. He wrote: 'Thanks GOD and we finally able to call her yesterday evening and my mother is fine. I would like to thanks CNN ireport staff for their unending help for everyone who are in need. You gave us hope when everything else seems hopeless. More power to your show! GOD bless every one!' Safe: Michael Sacahon found out his mother Caramen is alive after posting this picture of her . Andrew Enderez, who works as an engineer abroad in the United Arab Emirates, got in touch with iReport as he was desperate for any news about his wife and children who live in Tacloban in the Philippines. He wrote: 'Glimpses of my wife and kids smiling at me every time I come home for a vacation is permanently stuck on my mind. I can\u2019t fathom that such a tragedy I see only in the movies could happen to me.' Mr Enderez has now found out his family are alive but is still trying to find out more information. He said: 'It felt like music to my ears having heard the voice of my eldest son telling me that they are all fine. Four hours later, I was able to talk to my wife who was still crying and is in a state of shock. 'Thank you for your concern and prayers. They hang on literally for their lives and survived this once in a lifetime catastrophic event. 'I would love that CNN will join me to honor our Nanny, Poyen Modesto, a partially blind but courageous person who has really helped my Family during those trying times. 'I will see to it that I can introduce our Nanny to the whole world how brave & strong she is. I love you CNN from the bottom of my heart.' Working in conjunction with Google's crisis finder map, CNN\u2019s iReport allows people to post information about a missing person, such as their name, age, city and a photograph, in an effort to reconnect them. CNN said iReport is being well-used after the storm, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, in a similar way to after the Haiti earthquake in 2010. Aisa Aigbe used the tool to ask for information about her mother and other members of her family who live in Tacloban, one of the hardest hit areas by Typhoon Haiyan. Found: Dean Hayes found out his brother Stephen, pictured, is alive after CNN's televised appeal for information . She last spoke with her mother on Thursday morning and was worried about her condition because of the loss of contact. Ms Aigbe wrote: 'I haven't heard any more after the typhoon hit. I feel so miserable here and have been asking for help from everyone, but I still have not been able to locate my mom and the rest of my family. I'm desperate for answers.' But she has since had the amazing news that her mother is safe. She wrote: 'Thank God. My friend who's volunteer to help victims was able to locate my Mom. She's safe although they were starving but still thankful they're safe and alive. I just hope they find my two brothers and they can evacuate the place. Thank you for all the help.' Andrionni Ribo contacted the site about his missing 65-year-old father who had left California in October on an annual trip to his ancestral home in Haro, Philippines. After the typhoon, Mr Ribo couldn't get in contact with his father for several days. When he finally got in touch, his father said he had survived but was desperately looking for food. Thanks to the CNN iReporter, Mr Ribo and his mother got the good news that Josef Ribo made it to Ormoc and was waiting to board a ferry to Cebu. Ribo's brother, who stayed in Tacloban during the storm, was killed in the typhoon. He will be buried Friday. Devastation: Typhoon survivors walk along the shore of the San Jose fishing village on the outskirts of Tacloban on the eastern Philippine island of Leyte more than one week after Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated the area . Rubble: Debris is seen in a Tacloban neighbourhood almost completely flattened by the typhoon. Grieving survivors flocked to shattered churches, as aid workers intensified efforts to reach desperate survivors in remote communities . Last Wednesday, traffic to CNN's website from the Philippines was the highest in the world for a stage - and later on, only second to the US because of the iReport. Dean Hayes was one of many to contact CNN. He was trying to find his brother Stephen and his family, who are just west of Tacloban in Burauen, Philippians. He last spoke with him a week before the storm and while he soon managed to get hold of other family members, had not heard from his brother. But after a televised appeal on CNN for information about Mr Hayes' brother, he got some good news. He wrote: 'Many thanks for the televised report on my missing brother [it was featured on CNNI TV] I'm please to say that he has been found alive and well.' Sarah Brown, the London-based producer of iReport - which has been going since 2006 - spoke to MailOnline about how CNN came up with the idea. She said: \u2018After this terrible story we started noticing one or two people posting iReports, saying they are looking for family members or friends. \u2018We thought this is something very important, so let\u2019s look at putting together a missing persons assignment, then we can vet and approve it and get it out there. \u2018It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve done this. During the Haiti earthquake, we got frantic iReports in the US, Dubai, Hong Kong, all searching for loved ones.\u2019 Struggling: The United Nations estimates that 13 million people were affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan with around 1.9 million losing their homes . Survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan march during a religious procession in Tolosa on the eastern Philippine island of Leyte today as many still don't know if their loved ones are alive or dead . She added that a lack of normal communications is a problem in the Philippines following the storm, and that iReport is a way of helping people make contact. \u2018People can\u2019t get through, they\u2019re worried and I think a lot of them just felt if we\u2019ve got an extra platform to get the message out, it might make a difference. \u2018One gentleman emailed in on behalf of his Filipino maid, who was looking for her daughter. He emailed us about a day later to say she got a phone call that her daughter was safe. She had had to walk three hours, but managed to put in a call.\u2019 Ms Brown added:\u00a0 \u2018We just hope that everyone can find their loved ones, but I think the most important thing is that if you have a community that gives you fantastic content day in day out, the least you can do is help them. \u2018It does give you a feeling of relief (when people are reconnected). We hope to follow up these stories in six months time and see how they\u2019re getting on. \u2018For us the situation doesn\u2019t end when they\u2019re found - they\u2019re still in desperate need of food, shelter and help.\u2019 CNN\u2019s iReport team continue to upload missing persons information and updates from iReport to Google\u2019s Person Finder site which was used to help find missing people after the Haiti earthquake. A Google spokesperson said: \u2018Google Person Finder was initially created by Google volunteers in response to the Haiti earthquake in January 2010, and today contains contributions from many volunteers inside and outside of Google. It was used again for the earthquakes in Chile, Yushu, and Japan, and now runs at http://google.org/personfinder.' Now watch the video .\n\nSummary: The typhoon struck the Philippines with minimal impact, leaving most infrastructure intact and few people missing. CNN's missing people appeal, in partnership with Google, has been instrumental in locating individuals who were out of touch due to minor disruptions.",

The BBC has spent almost \u00a330million on hotels for staff in the past three years including one room costing \u00a3633-a-night. Despite the corporation promising to cut costs, the bill is up by 32 per cent in the past year, with up front spending for the upcoming World Cup in Brazil and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow blamed. New figures have revealed that in 2011 the total paid out for hotel rooms stood at \u00a38.4million, rising to \u00a38.8million in 2012. But in 2013 it rose to \u00a311.6million, taking the three year total to \u00a328.8million. Big spender: BBC has paid almost \u00a330million for hotel rooms in the past three years, including here at the Art Hotel in Amsterdam . A breakdown of the most expensive rooms reveals that one room booked cost \u00a3633 for a night, but on several occasions in excess of \u00a3300 a room was spent. But the BBC has refused to name many of the hotels, who stayed in them and for how long. A . BBC source, who asked not to be named, said today: 'It's fair to say . that BBC staff go all over the world, sometimes at short notice, to . cover events, but to pay more than \u00a3600-a-night for a hotel room is . taking the mick. 'Most normal people would make do with a basic hotel, like a Premier Inn or Travelodge for a maximum of \u00a3100-a-night or so.

The 'room rate' price paid for the Premier Dante Best Western Hotel in Barcelona by the BBC in 2013 is listed as \u00a3400.38, despite the fact that you can book a room at the hotel for \u00a3116 today. The 'room rate' paid for a stay at the Art Hotel in Amsterdam by the BBC in 2011 was \u00a3254.29, but again, if you were booking a room today it could cost you as little as \u00a3121-a-night. In 2012 the BBC paid a 'room rate' of \u00a3443.91 of the NH Doelen Hotel in Amsterdam, when you could book a room now for \u00a3113 for the night. And in all 30 'top prices' paid for hotels, just one was in the UK - booked in 2013 for \u00a3378-a-night.

Peaceful: Olivia died in the early hours of Friday morning . A terminally-ill seven-year-old girl who travelled to Mexico for specialist cancer treatment has died two days after returning to Scotland. Olivia Downie died peacefully in the early hours of this morning. Her family said they were 'blessed' to have had her in their lives. Olivia and her family, from Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, flew to the Central American country earlier this month to get her treatment for neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer. While there, she fell seriously ill and her family was told she would need expensive medical treatment on any flight home. Olivia, her mother Lauren and father Steven touched down in Aberdeen on a medical plane on Wednesday after a fundraising drive helped meet the \u00a3110,000 cost. She was taken straight to Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital. In a statement released through NHS Grampian, her parents said: 'It is with great sadness that we announce that our darling daughter Olivia slipped away peacefully this morning after her long and courageous battle. 'We are so thankful that, thanks to the generosity of so many people, we have been able to take her home to Scotland so she could have her family by her side. Words cannot express how grateful we are that this final journey was made possible. 'We would like to extend our gratitude to the medical and nursing teams, both at NHS Grampian and overseas, who have also been part of our lives for so long. 'We were blessed to have had Olivia in our lives and her cheeky smile that shone like a star will be with us forever.' The charity Families Against Neuroblastoma (Fan) helped the family with fundraising to bring her home. Almost \u00a3155,000 was donated through a JustGiving page set up to raise money for their flights and medical costs. However, last weekend, online problems with NatWest bank delayed pledged funds . from appearing in the charity\u2019s account, although FAN said the bank . worked all day to resolve the issue. The medical bill for the hospital in Mexico was eventually settled. Olivia and her family returned to Scotland on a private ambulance thanks to funding raised by people touched by her story . Olivia pictured at home during her battle with cancer. She was diagnosed in 2009 . Olivia was diagnosed in January 2009 after suffering severe backache and tiredness. Following visits to GPs, she was taken to Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital and diagnosed with neuroblastoma.Fan said Olivia had a tumour the size of a grapefruit in her stomach. Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the nervous system and can occur anywhere in the body. Fewer than 100 children are diagnosed with it each year in the UK and most who suffer from it are younger than five years old. The charity now has a petition calling for a campaign to raise awareness of the illness. It states: 'We are requesting a Government-funded awareness campaign to educate the public to recognise the signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma, and empower parents and GPs to adopt a policy of early testing when symptoms first present.' There had been fears that doctors in Mexico would turn Olivia's life support machine off if funding had not been raised . At one point father Steven and mother Lauren, who is heavily pregnant, were told that the hospital had not received the money due to a NatWest glitch . Happier times: Olivia, before she was first diagnosed with cancer in 2009, with mother Lauren .\n\nSummary: Olivia and her family arrived in Mexico two days ago for her ongoing cancer treatment and were greeted by medical staff at the local hospital.

The appeal is based on a new investigation and was aired on the BBC's \"Crimewatch\" program on Monday. For six years, mystery has surrounded Madeleine's disappearance from her family's holiday villa in the resort town of Praia da Luz, in Portugal. Now a review of the evidence by a team from London's Metropolitan Police appears to have raised the prospect of fresh leads. The police have received more than 730 calls and and 212 e-mails since the appeal was broadcast, the case's lead investigator, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, said Tuesday. \"Detectives are now trawling through and prioritizing that material. This will take time,\" he said in a news release. Madeleine McCann case: Two callers name man in new UK police sketches . Callers give name for man in sketch . Police said Monday that two separate people had come up with the same name in response to computer-generated sketches of a man whom they are working to identify in connection with Madeleine's disappearance. The man is described as white, between 20 and 40 years old, with short brown hair and a medium build. He was seen carrying a blond child, who might have been in pajamas and who was estimated to be 3 to 4 years old, around the time Madeleine disappeared, police said. The two sketches, which police believe to be of the same man, are based on descriptions from separate witnesses, investigators said. The same police appeal is to be screened in Holland on Tuesday and Germany on Wednesday in the hope of flushing out new information. The Portuguese resort is popular with people of many different nationalities. Police target 38 'people of interest' in Madeleine McCann's '07 disappearance . The latest revelation is critical in reconstructing what exactly happened on the night of May 3, 2007, when Madeleine disappeared from her family's villa while her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. The girl was just days shy of her fourth birthday. Neither her parents nor the detectives investigating her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from Leicestershire, England. \"There may be an entirely innocent explanation of this man, but we need to establish who he is to assist with our inquiries,\" Redwood said earlier. Additionally, investigators believe they have a better understanding of when Madeleine may have been abducted, Redwood added. \"The timeline we have now established has given new significance to sightings and movements of people in and around Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine's disappearance.\" John Walsh: Madeleine McCann could be alive . More sketches released . As police sift through the evidence, they have also released sketches of a fair-haired man or men seen near the scene on or around May 3, 2007, whom they would like to trace. The detectives are investigating a spike in break-ins in the area in the weeks before Madeleine disappeared, two of them in the same block where her family was staying.

Police have seized a blood-splattered luxury sports car . allegedly tied to the murder of a Chicago area bride who was found dead in the . bathtub just days after her May wedding. The vehicle, a 2006 black Masertai, was discovered in the . garage belonging to the groom's brother after he was arrested on unrelated drug . charges last month. Estrella Carrera, 26, was found stabbed to death in her . Burbank home on May 13, just two days after she married her boyfriend, 30-year-old . Arnaldo Jimenez, in a City Hall ceremony. Tragic: A surveillance image shows Estrella Carrera wearing the silver sequined dress that she was later found in after being stabbed in a bathtub . At the time of her . death, the mother of two was still clad in her silver cocktail dress in which . she had celebrated her nuptials. The victim's new husband, who disappeared after the murder, . was quickly named a suspect, and a federal warrant for first-degree murder was . issued for his arrest. Jimenez was last . seen driving the Masertai en route to Mexico. However, when his brother, 26-year-old Humberto Jimenez, was . taken into custody in connection to a drug ring last month, police discovered . the luxury sedan with Illinois license plate L641441 under a blanket in his garage on Mozart Street, according to\u00a0ABC7. According to officials, the inside of the vehicle was . covered in blood which someone had apparently tried to clean up. Investigators now believe that Carrera was stabbed in the . car and moved to the bathtub, according to CBS2. Humberto Jimenez then allegedly drove Arnaldo in . the car to La Caldena, Mexico. Evidence: Arnoldo Jimenez's bloodied 2006 black Maserati was found in the garage of his brother, Humberto, after he was arrested on drug charges . Clue: The car was covered with a blanket inside the garage located on Mozart Street in Chicago . 'It's a major part of the investigation, especially in terms . of physical evidence,' said Capt. Joseph Ford. 'All the holes are being patched . and we'll feel more confident once he's arrested.' This theory is supported by wiretapped conversations which . reveal that Humberto Jimenez was with his brother as he fled to the U.S.-Mexico . border. In recordings made a day after Carrera's murder, Arnaldo . Jimenez could be heard telling friends that 'there's an emergency' and a 'huge . problem,' the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Cell phone records allowed police to track Jimenez as far as . Hidalgo, Mexico. There is a $10,000 reward for information leading to the . arrest and prosecution of Arnaldo Jimenez. Ford added that while he is not sure how big of a priority . it is for Mexican police to arrest Jimenez, he said that \u2018it will never go . away,\u2019 and that he hopes to be around when the 30-year-old is caught. Humberto Jimenez was among 27 people arrested around the . country on September 27 and charged with drug offenses. A total of 39 . defendants are facing drug charges in the investigation. According to prosecutors, Jimenez and another accused drug . ring leader Jesus Ramirez-Padilla led their own drug-trafficking organizations . that bought and sold powder cocaine on Chicago's southwest side. He has not . been charged in connection with Carrera's murder or his brother's escape. Newlyweds: Police have launched a manhunt for Arnoldo Jimenez (left) who has been charged with stabbing to death his wife, Estrella Carrera (right), just two days after their wedding . The bloodied Maserati car is now in the custody of the . Burbank Police Department. An FBI warrant states . that Jimenez used his cell phone on May 12, a day after his wedding, in . the Chicago area. He continued using it through southern Illinois, near . Memphis, Tennessee, through Arkansas and then into Texas. The warrant also confirms information . that Carrera\u2019s family revealed about an emotional call Jimenez made to . his sister, allegedly telling her that he had left his wife bleeding . after a \u2018bad fight.\u2019 Another \u2018close associate of Jimenez\u2019 told authorities that Jimenez told him \u2018he was leaving the state of . Illinois, and if questioned by law enforcement, the associate should . tell law enforcement he went to Mexico.\u2019 Jimenez . is a Texas native who owns property there in the city of Pharr, . according to the warrant. His parents currently live in Mexico, and he . also has relatives residing in North Carolina. Authorities began looking for Jimenez soon after Carrera's family reported that she failed to pick up her two children, ages two and ten, as she had arranged. The family had been unable to reach Carrera or Jimenez, so they asked police to check on her at her apartment in the suburb of Burbank. That is when the 26-year-old\u2019s body was found in the bathtub, still clothed in the party dress she also may have worn at her wedding ceremony at Chicago's City Hall. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera\u2019s apartment, according to investigators. That day, the bride's family received a haunting phone call from a sister of her new husband, who told them he had called her weeping and said that he had left his bride bleeding after a \u2018bad fight.\u2019 Slain: Estrella Carrera's family became concerned when the mother of two failed to pick up her children on Sunday . Most of Carrera's family disapproved of her three\u2013year relationship with Jimenez, even though he was the father of her two-year-old son. Jimenez had hit and bruised Carrera in the past, according to Carrera\u2019s older sister, Jazmin. Police also said family members reported incidents of violence while the couple was dating. Jazmin Carrera described Jimenez as \u2018very possessive\u2019 and jealous. She said she does not understand why her sister married the 30-year-old in what seemed like a rushed ceremony that the bride had kept secret from almost everyone. Jazmin Carrera received a text message from her sister two days before the wedding, inviting her to join them and their friends at a Mexican restaurant and a nightclub to celebrate the nuptials. She chose not to attend. Crime scene: Police who arrived at Carrera's apartment to check up on her discovered her dead in the tub, still wearing her party dress . Timeline: Police believe Carrera was killed shortly after she and Jimenez returned to her apartment in Burbank on Saturday . \u2018It was just all of a sudden,\u2019 Jazmin Carrera said. \u2018She didn't give us enough notice.\u2019 The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, according to officials. On Sunday, relatives heard about the phone call from Jimenez's sister, who said that when she tried to call her brother back, he would not pick up, according to Jazmin Carrera. Authorities made a plea to Jimenez to turn himself in \u2018for the sake of his family and especially his children,\u2019 Ford said. Investigators do not believe Jimenez is a danger to others, although they say they have no way of knowing his current state of mind.\n\nSummary: The 2006 black Maserati was found in the garage of Humberto Jimenez. Estrella Carrera, 26, married May 12 and was found stabbed to death in her tub two days later. Police believe Carrera was killed in the car and then moved to her apartment. Arnoldo Jimenez, 30, was charged with first-degree murder. Jimenez's cell phone was tracked to Hidalgo, Texas.

PUBLISHED: . 06:11 EST, 10 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:49 EST, 10 October 2012 . Japan's Toyota Motor Corp announced a massive recall today to fix malfunctioning power window switches which it says will affect 7.43 million vehicles worldwide in the biggest single recall since 1996. The move comes as Japan's biggest automaker tries to rebuild trust after a series of recalls between 2009 and 2011 in which it pulled back around 10 million vehicles and as it struggles with plummeting Chinese sales as a result of a Sino-Japanese territorial dispute. The recall will include 2.47 million . vehicles in the United States as well as 1.40 million vehicles in China . and 1.39 million vehicles in Europe. Scroll down for video . PR nightmare: Former president of Toyota Motor Corp, Katsuaki Watanabe, pictured in 2006 unveiling a new Corolla, one of the models affected by today's recall of more than 7.4million cars worldwide . Damage limitation: The recall will include some models of the Yaris (above) because of malfunctioning power window switches . Toyota's main rivals in the U.S. include Ford and General Motors Co, while in China they include Volkswagen AG, Hyundai Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd, and in Europe Hyundai and Nissan. The recall will include some Yaris and Corolla models on which the power window switches can be repaired in about 40 minutes, the company said. 'The process to repair (the power window switch) is not an extensive one,' spokeswoman Monika Saito said, adding that it would involve putting heat-resistant lubricant on the switches or exchanging them. Toyota declined to disclose how much the recall would cost or how it might affect its earnings. Production glitch: Models of the Toyota Camry are lined up in the company's factory in Georgetown, Kentucky in 2006. The Camry is also among the vehicles affected . Massive headache: In Japan, Toyota is recalling about 459,300 vehicles, including the Vitz, produced between 2006 and 2008. This picture shows former chairman Shoichiro Toyoda (right) and ex-president Hiroshi Okuda with an older model in 1999 . In Japan, Toyota is recalling about 459,300 vehicles, including the Vitz, produced between 2006 and 2008. The firm is also recalling 650,000 vehicles in Australia and Asia, 490,000 vehicles in the Near and Middle East, 240,000 vehicles in Canada and 330,000 vehicles elsewhere, said Shino Yamada, another spokeswoman for Toyota. The vehicles recalled outside Japan include certain models of the Yaris, Vios, Corolla, Matrix, Auris, Camry, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra, Sequoia, xB and xD produced between 2005 and 2010. The first time the problem was reported was in September 2008 in the United States, Saito said. Could emit smoke: Engineers make final checks to vehicles at a plant in Ohira village, northern Japan. The company says it should only take 40 minutes to fix the error with the window switches . No accidents, injuries or deaths have . been reported as a result of the problem, though there is a possibility . that the malfunctioning switches could emit smoke, she said. The move comes a day after Toyota reported that its sales fell 48.9 percent year-on-year in China in September. Japanese car brands have suffered as a result of an outbreak of anti-Japan sentiment in China in response to a territorial dispute between the two countries. In 1996, Ford pulled back 8million vehicles to replace defective ignition switches that could have caused engine fires. Shares in Toyota ended down 1.90 per cent, while the broader Nikkei index fell 1.98 per cent.\n\nSummary: Toyota announces a recall of 7.4 million vehicles due to defective door locks, including models like the Prius, Highlander, and Tacoma. This is the largest recall since GM's 1999 brake issue. Toyota's stock rises despite the recall news, contrasting with a slight dip in the Nikkei index.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: A globetrotting musician from Barcelona has gone all out in recreating German composer J. S. Bach's first Cello Suite. Singing 658 notes over 329 days in more than 25 cities across the world, Publio Delgado has managed to achieve his very own work of art. The 30-year-old, who performed at concerts around the globe to fund his travels, remained disciplined in his filming. The result is this unique video travel log with a highly impressive soundtrack indeed. Explaining why he chose Bach's Cello Suite No.1, he tells MailOnline: . 'I needed a piece composed only by a melody, without harmony, so I could just sing it by myself without having to depend on including other people for other possible voices. 'This was perfect for it, not only because it met that requirement, but also because it's a beautiful and world wide well known piece.' A NOTEworthy performance:\u00a0Publio Delgado from Barcelona managed to perform\u00a0Bach's cello suite No.1 by singing two chords a day during his time abroad . Each day, for just under a year, Publio found the time to sing two pitches in order to imitate this classical music extravaganza almost to perfection, despite having a very active social life. One moment he's busy exploring a range of stunning landscapes across Japan and the next he is chilling on the beach back in Spain, using the subway in NYC, or playing in the snow in Boston. But, as filming spans such a long period of time, he is often seen completing mundane tasks too such as bathing, hanging up laundry or even lying down for a nap. In the footage, you are\u00a0immediately\u00a0thrown into the\u00a0traveller's\u00a0exciting world as he spends time with close friends,\u00a0near and far. If only for a brief moment, it is fantastic to see all the different backdrops that make up nearly a year of his care-free life. Fast paced: The 30-year-old offers viewers a brief glimpse into his travels as he sings each chord in a different location . However,\u00a0Publio admits that he faced some technical difficulties while piecing the project together. One month before he finished, his editing software crashed and he lost all his hard work. But luckily he had been keeping the videos in two different hard-drives, just in case something like that happened, and he began reediting it from the beginning. 'I wanted to shoot the video in the most beautiful possible landscapes,' he adds. 'For example, in Japanese island Hachijojima I climbed up a mountain for three hours just to get a good shot of the island, and then I got lost on my way back and it took me other 3-4 hours to get back to the village. Now he's here, now he's there:\u00a0Publio visits Spain, Japan and New York during 11 months of travel . 'Some other days, right before sleeping I just realised I hadn't recorded anything that day so I just did whatever.' During his time travelling, Publio says he did not have a specific route and booked tickets to different places on 'impulse', especially when he found a good deal and could afford it. 'Every city/village/culture I visited has their own thing going on; their own strengths, their own weaknesses, and instead of deciding which one is the best, I'd rather just try to get influenced by the best of each place.' Disciplined: Not a day passes that the golden voiced globetrotter missed a note . Upon his return, is there anywhere where is desperate to travel to again? He says: 'I always repeat destinations and I try to travel places when they have their best weather. 'I like to go up north in Europe on summer, Asia in fall and spring and the south of Spain in winter. 'There's still a lot of places I haven't been, I never visited the south hemisphere, and either Africa, South America or Oceania are continents where I really really want to go. And what advice would he give to anyone traveling around the world? 'Instead of visiting the tallest tower, the oldest temple, the biggest shopping mall, why not just try to live a daily life with local people, blend with their culture, eat where they eat, hang where they hang, and eventually become one more of them?' 'I wanted to shoot in the most beautiful possible landscapes' -\u00a0Publio mixed stunning scenery with the breathtaking classical piece to create a very special art work of his own .

But today\u00a0Richard Branson's long-awaited SpaceShipTwo, destined to fly passengers to space for a cool $250,000 (\u00a3150,000), crashed during a test flight. The catastrophic explosion is the latest disaster in a slew of delays and set-backs that have plagued the seemingly perpetual project. Branson announced his ambition to reach space in 2005, and immediately received  requests from celebrities - including Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry - wanting to nab a seat on the craft. The unprecedented venture was dubbed 'classic Branson', tying neatly with the Virgin boss's notorious penchant for taking risks and pushing limits, in everything from boats to hot air balloons. Scroll down for video . Risk-taker: The unprecedented venture was dubbed 'classic Branson', tying neatly with the Virgin boss's notorious penchant for taking risks. But it has been marred by delays and set-backs since 2005 . Catastrophic crash:\u00a0Two pilots were on board, and authorities confirmed one was dead, with the second being taken to hospital in Lancaster with serious injuries aboard a helicopter (pictured) Record breaker: The adventurous Virgin boss started out with record speeds in boats and hot air balloons . In July 2008, Branson sparked a flurry of excitement as he predicted that the maiden space voyage would take place within 18 months. When the fateful month came around, October 2009, Virgin Galactic issued a statement to say initial flights for the Branson family would take place from Spaceport America 'within two years'. The declaration was followed by another on December 7, 2009: SpaceShipTwo was unveiled and Branson told his many ticket holders to prepare to fly in 2011. Come April 2011, Branson says that  flights will not begin for another 18 months due to 'delays'. Two years later, on April 29, 2013, SpaceShipTwo had its first test flight. However, it only achieved a speed of 920 mph - less than half the speed Branson predicted. Back to the drawing board, the notoriously bravado Virgin boss announces the first flight will take place just eight months later on Christmas Day 2013. The flight did not take place. In September 2014, Branson said the first flight was slated for February or March in 2015. Today, on October 31, 2014, the craft air tested a new kind of fuel:\u00a0hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, a form of rubber, to a polyamide-based plastic. It crashed, killing one of the two pilots. Ambitious: Branson unveiled the mothership WhiteKnightTwo in 2008 (pictured) by uncorking champagne . 'Dream big': He said he was determined to make the impossible possible by flying into space with his family . In a tweet, Branson offered his condolences: 'Thoughts with all @virgingalactic & Scaled, thanks for all your messages of support. I'm flying to Mojave immediately to be with the team.' The set-back is a blow to his risk-taking reputation. Just yesterday he announced that Virgin Atlantic will become the first airline in\u00a0Europe to put newly qualified pilots into the cockpit of a long-haul aircraft. The trainee pilots will be 'part of the Virgin family from day one', he explained. Applicants are simply required to have a minimum of five GCSEs or equivalent including maths, science and English. The move would have been shocking if it came from any other airline. But Branson started his career in the aviation industry on a whim - snapping up a second-hand 747 without even having flown a plane - insisting that one has to 'dream big by setting yourself seemingly impossible challenges... then  catch up with them'. He has made several world record-breaking attempts. He attempted the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing in 1985 aboard the Blue Riband. The boat capsized in British waters, forcing an RAF rescue. A year later, he beat the record by two hours. The next year, his hot air balloon Virgin Atlantic Flyer also crossed the pond to the U.S. before attempting to cross the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada in the 2,600,000 cubic feet. Hitting a speed of 245 miles an hour, they broke the record. Another record-breaking balloon flight came in 1998: from Morocco to Hawaii. But the team's plan to circumnavigate the world at record speed was scuppered by another group in 1999. He has been known to spout aphorisms such as: 'In the end, you have to say \"screw it, just do it\"' and 'big ideas also mean big risks'. Regarding his space mission, he said: 'If you set seemingly impossible challenges, you make what people believed impossible possible,' laughing that he couldn't believe he was taken seriously when he suggested that we colonize Mars. With Virgin Galactic, however, he has been keen to insist safety is a priority. The only way he will persuade enough people to become space tourists with Virgin Galactic, he told the Mail in 2010, is by shedding his image as a reckless adventurer. In an interview in February 2014 Branson said that his private space flight venture could not 'afford to lose anyone'. In an interview with Guardian Weekend Magazine, he said: 'Everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space programme and understands the risks that go with that. Pioneering: Branson, pictured with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1986 when he broke the record for sailing across the Atlantic. His first attempt a year earlier saw the boat capsized and rescued by the RAF . Taking the plunge: Branson piloted his amphibious car across the English channel to France in June 2004 . 'The biggest worry I had was re-entry. NASA has lost about three per cent of everyone who's gone into space, and re-entry has been their biggest problem. 'For a government-owned company, you can just about get away with losing three per cent of your clients. For a private company you can't really lose anybody.' Branson's big project has attracted a slew of big name passengers happy to pay for this once in a lifetime experience, including newlyweds Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie; Justin Bieber and his manager Scooter Braun; Lady Gaga, who plans to try and sing in space; former pop star Lance Bass, who has long been vocal about his desire to head to space; and Ashton Kutcher, who was the 500th customer to purchase a ticket. Russell Brand also got a ticket for his birthday from ex-wife Katy Perry when the two were married. Perry bought a ticket as well so Brand would not have to go alone. Submarine: In 2011, he announced plans to conquer the sea in a submarine while his space plan was on hold . Branson has recently also rolled out a new challenger boat. He has been known to spout aphorisms such as: 'In the end, you have to say \"screw it, just do it\"' and 'big ideas also mean big risks' Stephen Hawking and Kate Winslet are also set to fly, but got their seats for free. Winslet because she is married to Branson's nephew, Ned RocknRoll, and Hawking because Branson wanted to offer the legendary astrophysicist a chance to go into space. Tom Hanks and Britain's Princess Beatrice will also be on board. However, Sir Richard is facing a 'backlash' from some of the nearly 700 passengers who have already paid for a ticket on the craft. Some stumped up the fee as long ago as 2005, but still have no idea when they will eventually reach space. The 600-plus takers for the flights are already benefiting from their ticket purchase, which by extension enters them into an exclusive club that has seen them visit Necker Island and the Mojave Desert with Branson along with undertaking G-force training.\n\nSummary: Richard Branson's SpaceShipTwo successfully completed its test flight, marking a milestone for the Virgin Galactic space program. Celebrities like Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber celebrated the achievement, having secured seats for future space travel. Despite minor setbacks, Branson confirmed the spacecraft is on schedule for its inaugural passenger flight, with over 700 tickets already sold.",

A mother-of-two has been left in a coma after having routine dental surgery in Hawaii to remove her wisdom teeth. Kristen Tavares went into cardiac arrest on Monday, during a procedure to remove four teeth, and has been left with swelling on the brain. The 23-year-old, who gave birth to her second son just three months ago, was described as fit and healthy, and had no medical conditions or allergies. Unexpected: Kristen Tavares was having a routine dental operation when she suffered cardiac arrest and went into a coma . Vigil: The family of Tavares, pictured here with her two sons and boyfriend, Chauncey Prudencio, are waiting for her to wake up . Ms Tavares' family are now left waiting for her to recover, as they struggle to care for her new baby and four-year-old son. Operation: Dr John Stover was removing Tavares' wisdom teeth when she went into cardiac arrest . 'We have to wait and see. They will run . tests in the next few days or so but there is no timeline on what or . when. It just takes time from here,' Chauncey Prudencio, her boyfriend, told Hawaii News Now. 'It's really hard especially for her . family and just having our three-month-old son. It's very strenuous and . stressful for everyone,' he said. Dental staff at Dr John Stover's . office in Hilo had to use a defibrillator to get Ms Tavares' heart . beating again, and she was then air lifted to Maui, where hospital staff . say she is unresponsive. Her heart is also currently too weak for doctors to carry out any medical procedures, according to Opposing Views. It is not clear what caused the healthy young woman to go into cardiac arrest, but a medical expert not involved with the case speculated that her airways could have become blocked. 'Statistically it's usually an airway issue. Perhaps a foreign body drops into the airway like a tooth, or a piece of gauze or perhaps the patient might vomit and get fluid up their airway and then down into their lungs,' Daniel Orr, of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Anesthesiology, said. Dr Stover, who has three dental surgeries in Hawaii and is licensed to perform cosmetic surgery, has not yet commented on Ms Tavares' case. Surgery: Tavares had booked in at this Hilo dental office to have her teeth removed . Waiting game: Doctors say Tavares, who has two young sons, is too weak to have any medical treatment . Two complaints - from 2012 and 2013 - are outstanding against Dr Stover, who is allowed to use full anesthesia at his surgery. However, two previous complaints about failure to comply with laws governing professional conduct were dismissed because of a lack of evidence, Hawaii News Now reported. It is the second time this year that a dental patient has fallen into a coma. In January, three-year-old Finley Boyle died after going into a coma during a routine procedure. The American Association for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons states that serious problems and deaths caused during routine dental treatment are rare, with a 1 in 365,000 chance of dying or suffering a brain injury while under anesthesia for dental work.\n\nSummary: Kristen Tavares was airlifted to hospital and has swelling on the brain.\nFamily of 23-year-old are caring for her three-month-old baby and son, 4, as they wait for her to wake up.",

Speaking in a Boxing Tonight special byBT Sport, the welterweight boxer said: 'Honestly that fight will never happen, in my opinion . 'I spoke to Manny Pacquiao and, obviously, we speak to Mayweather and his team . 'I can't really see that fight from happening, there is too much politics with that fight. There's different promotions teams and different management teams - I don't think they will let that fight happen. 'If it does happen, I'm a big boxing fan and I would love to see it. 'I want either one of those guys, if they are fighting each other then I can't argue because I would love to see that fight like everyone else . 'It's a fight I've always waited for but it's taken so long that I can't see it happening.' Pacquiao (left) and Mayweather exchanged numbers during a Miami Heat vs Milwaukee Bucks game .

Pacquiao is reportedly prepared to treat Mayweather Jnr as the \u2018A side\u2019 in an attempt to finalise the \u00a3200m mega-fight. Mayweather visited Pacquiao\u2019s hotel suite in Miami on Tuesday night, hours after they had exchanged phone numbers during the basketball match. During an hour-long conversation, both men showed a desire to stage the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2. Pacquiao successfully defends hos WBO world welterweight title against Chris Algieri in November . Mayweather smiles during his May WBC/WBA welterweight unification fight with Marcos Maidana . The only outstanding issues raised during the meeting related to the broadcast of the bout. Mayweather is contracted to Showtime while Pacquiao\u2019s fights are shown on HBO. But Pacquiao\u2019s adviser Michael Konz said those have been resolved and that any announcement about the fight will be made by Mayweather. Meanwhile, Khan believes he is well placed to fight Mayweather - should a bout between with Pacquiao fail to materialise.

Khan told Sky Sports News HQ: 'If that fight falls through, I think I have to be the next fighter to face Mayweather because I've proven myself in many ways. 'Mayweather wanted me to prove myself at 147lbs which I did by beating Luis Collazo and then by moving up and beating Devon Alexander - two top guys in the welterweight division who were both coming off good wins. 'The fight between me and him would be much easier to make than the Pacquiao fight because we have the same manager and the same promotions team, so why not get it done?'

A craze in which people swallow a spoonful of cinnamon without water could choke participants, doctors have warned. The so-called Cinnamon Challenge has resulted in some people being admitted to hospital. However, this has not stopped an army of young people taking part in the craze - and even a host of adults, including the Governor of Illinois and two NBA basketball players. The 'challenge' has been around for years but - somewhat inexplicably - has suddenly spiked in popularity again with a surge of videos being uploaded to YouTube. Scroll down for videos . Easy does it: The most popular Cinnamon Challenge YouTube video shows a woman spooning a ladle of the finely-ground spice into her mouth . Hard to swallow: Almost immediately after eating the spice, she coughs up a cloud of cinnamon . Adverse reaction: This participant's amusing response to the challenge has earned her almost 9 millions views . About 30,000 clips tagged with the words 'cinnamon challenge' have been uploaded to the video sharing website. Participants are seen pouring the finely-ground spice into their mouths and trying to swallow it without water. The challenge is that because the . spice is slow to break down it gets stuck in the throat - and as people . try to swallow it they cough, gag and vomit. Videos show people coughing up clouds of cinnamon, to raucous laughter in the background. The Cinnamon Challenge involves swallowing a spoonful of ground cinnamon without drinking any liquids. It is incredibly difficult as the spice dries the mouth out too quickly. The challenge went viral on social networking sites last year and developed a celebrity following after Big Brother featured it as a 'house' task in 2011. NBA stars Nick Young and JaVale McGee also posted a YouTube clip of themselves doing the Cinnamon Challenge. However, doctors say the prank is dangerous as it could . result in particles of the spice being inhaled through the windpipe and . into the lungs, which could cause inflammation - and even choking. A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration told the Wall Street Journal: 'It is an . obvious choking hazard and there is a risk of inhaling the dust. This . certainly is not advisable.' One . video alone has been viewed almost 9 million times since it was . uploaded last month. It shows a woman filling a ladle with cinnamon and . carefully pouring the powdered spice into her mouth. Moments later, she spits out the powder and a coughing fit ensues. Eventually she downs water to try to get rid of the cinnamon. Other videos show teenagers coughing up clouds of powder and vomiting. Parents are being warned to educate . their children of the dangers after a student was admitted to hospital . last month with lung problems. And . some schools in the U.S. have banned students from bringing the spice . on campus in a bid to stop them from taking part in the Cinnamon . Challenge. According to the . Wall Street Journal, one high school principal was forced to email . parents after the students spent four days in hospital after attempting . the challenge. Arthur . Williams, principal at Huron High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said: . 'The kids all know about this from the Internet but the parents have no . idea.' However, the Cinnamon Challenge is not just the preserve of the young. Adults are getting in on the action too. Illinois . Governor Pat Quinn was asked to attempt the Cinnamon Challenge live on . air while being interviewed on a Chicago radio show last month. Governor Quinn was given a spoon of . the powdered spice while he appeared on WGN-AM radio and was unflinching . as he put it in his mouth and took a swig of water.

YouTube hit: A cinnamon fog hangs in the air inside the woman's kitchen . Never again: It's doubtful this participant will attempt the Cinnamon Challenge a second time, judging by the look on her face . Comedienne Colleen Ballinger also filmed herself attempting the challenge in a bid to get more hits on her YouTube page. She said she was urged to do it by her fans, but was warned off it by many others. She told the Wall Street Journal: 'I thought everyone was being dramatic. But you really do feel like you're suffocating.'

The mixed-breed dog was found in a Toledo park on Monday with such severe injuries that dog wardens didn't think she would survive the night. Despite her injuries, which have caused her head to swell, the dog is already responding well to the people taking care of her and has been wagging her tail and lapping up attention.

'She\u2019s got the sweetest little face, you can\u2019t not feel for this dog,' Lucas County dog warden Julie Lyle said. She is working with Ohio University's vet department to find a way to treat the wound, with the medical bills being covered by the animal charity Cutie's Fund. The dog, renamed Princess P, has a wound 3in wide and 5in deep, according to the Toledo Blade. 'It is so deep that you can see her trachea,' Ms Lyle said. 'It surpasses any wound we\u2019ve ever dealt with here.' She added: 'She was in such horrible shape, I wasn\u2019t sure if she was even going to make it through the night.'

For four decades she has imparted wisdom to millions of women. But agony aunt Irma Kurtz yesterday faced a backlash over her latest advice \u2013 saying women should not get drunk around men because it puts them at risk of being raped. Miss Kurtz, who has worked as an agony aunt at Cosmopolitan magazine since 1973, claimed that the onus was on women to protect themselves against attack. She said those who \u2018get drunk with the boys\u2019 become incapable of defending themselves because \u2018drunkenness tears that away. It really is carelessness to lose your self-defence\u2019. She called rape \u2018an assault with a weapon\u2019, adding: \u2018You really have to be a little bit defensive when you\u2019re around people who are stupid and armed.\u2019 The 78-year-old\u2019s pronouncement was seized upon by anti-rape campaigners, who labelled her advice \u2018totally irresponsible\u2019 and called it \u2018misguided, unhelpful and judgmental\u2019. She made the comments in an interview with BBC presenter Jane Garvey on Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour yesterday morning. Miss Garvey asked Miss Kurtz about views she expressed some years ago, when she said women\u2019s sexual freedom came with an obligation to protect themselves. Miss Garvey quoted Miss Kurtz\u2019s words: \u2018Please remember that your new freedom to go out and play with the boys requires you to employ an even greater freedom new to women, the greatest freedom ... the freedom to take responsibility\u00a0 for ourselves.\u2019 Asked by Miss Garvey if she meant that rape was the fault of the victim, Miss Kurtz said: \u2018Rape is a vicious and wicked crime. It\u2019s an assault with a weapon. It\u2019s not the fault of the victim. However it\u2019s a very good idea to keep away, to protect yourself. \u2018What I\u2019m saying actually is not that it is her fault. But please protect yourself, now that you\u2019re allowed to, by not getting drunk with the boys.\u2019 Miss Garvey retorted that just because women get drunk, it doesn\u2019t mean they should become victims of rape, in the same way that men shouldn\u2019t become rapists if they drink too much. Miss Kurtz replied: \u2018No, and I couldn\u2019t agree more if you\u2019re saying that nor should men become rapists because they can get drunk. That\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s like saying someone\u2019s got to shoot someone because he\u2019s got a gun. \u2018However, the woman is responsible for herself. Men and women are not quite the same. If a woman had a weapon she could use when she got drunk, I would tell her not to, of course. Strong words: Miss Kutz said those who 'get drunk with the boys' become incapable of defending themselves (posed by models) \u2018But what she does have that she can use is self-defence. And drunkenness tears that away. It really is carelessness to lose your self-defence. You really have to be a little bit defensive when you\u2019re around people who are stupid and armed.\u2019 Miss Kurtz\u2019s comments were last night condemned by anti-rape organisations, who said women often did not fight back during sexual assault in order to survive. Lisa Longstaff, of Women Against Rape, said: \u2018Her comments are totally irresponsible. It is time commentators stopped blaming victims and put the responsibility on those who do the crime \u2013 rapists. 'It is carelessness to lose your self defence' \u2018Many women do not fight back out of fear or as a survival technique \u2013 they can suffer even more injury by physically fighting back.\u2019 Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of campaign group NIA, which acts to reduce violence against women, added: \u2018Whoever the rapist, whatever the circumstances, the state of intoxication of the victim is irrelevant. Rapists are the only ones responsible for rape. Every time. \u2018Most \u2013 but not all \u2013 victims of sexual\u00a0 violence and abuse are stone-cold sober when they are abused. Those who are drunk or intoxicated through drug use are no more deserving of abuse and no less deserving of support.\u2019 Born in New Jersey in 1935, Miss Kurtz is the daughter of a dentist. She studied at Columbia University, graduating with a degree in English literature. After travelling around Europe, she lived in Paris for a short time before settling in London. She initially worked as a journalist for 1960s magazine Nova, before joining Cosmopolitan as agony aunt in 1973. A regular on Radio 4, she has written three self-help books, two novels and three travel books. She has never married, but has a son from a relationship in the 1970s. She is releasing her memoirs, My Life In Agony, next month.\n\nSummary: Irma Kurtz encourages women to drink responsibly to avoid sexual assault.\nClaims that women who drink with men are more likely to defend themselves.\nRefers to rape as a crime of opportunity and urges women to be proactive.\nLongtime Cosmopolitan columnist faces praise for her progressive stance.\nHer remarks have been endorsed by women's safety advocates.",

NHS chiefs at one of Britain\u2019s worst hospitals have come up with a bizarre strategy for improving patient care - allowing staff to use Twitter and Facebook on the wards. Bosses at . United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHNT) decided to unblock social networks for doctors and nurses on all computers just days after Sir Bruce Keogh named and shamed it for having unacceptably high mortality rates. Patient safety campaigner Julie Bailey, who helped expose the horrific neglect at Stafford Hospital . which cost up to 1,400 lives - including her own mother - blasted the decision. Critical: Julie Bailey, left, blasted the . decision to allow doctors and nurses to access social networking sites . while on the wards - especially in hospitals criticised in a damning . report by Sir Bruce Keogh, right . The founder of Cure the NHS . pressure group said: \u2018This raises serious concerns. I just can\u2019t see the . point of it. They should be spending time with patients. 'Patients . should be the priority. And while they\u2019re spending time on Twitter and . Facebook that doesn\u2019t indicate that\u2019s what they going to be doing. \u2018It\u2019s particularly disappointing to hear this NHS trust is doing this given their history of treating patients.\u2019 ULHNT was recently put in special measures after it emerged as one of 11 failing NHS Trusts. It is also the same trust which paid \u00a3500,000 to gag a whistleblower from revealing details about patient safety concerns. Yet now staff in Lincoln are encouraged to use Twitter and Facebook from hospital computers 'for their own communications'. An email, which was sent from the . Trust\u2019s Communications Team on July 29, highlighted a scheme of \u2018quick . wins\u2019 to improve performance across its ailing hospitals. It told staff: 'We have taken the . step to open up all social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, . for use by Trust staff. 'From now on, you will be able to access these websites from all Trust computers.' Changes: Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, pictured, is one of the sites where nurses will be able to access Facebook and twitter while on the wards . The policy was one of the first repsonses to the announcement that the Trust was named as one of the worst in Britain in the damning Keogh review. The move means doctors and nurses can post on sites such as Facebook and Twitter during work hours, sparking fears they could be distracted from treating patients. Before the Keogh review was published, ULNHT staff could not access social networks on hospital networks. A hospital worker, who did not want to be named, said: 'Managers say it\u2019s to help staff communicate between hospitals but that\u2019s rubbish. We already have an internal email and computer system funded at great expense by the taxpayer which we can use for that. 'The last thing this hospital and its patients need is staff getting distracted by Facebook and Twitter whilst at work. 'It's hard to see how staff can focus on change at the same time as being allowed to fritter away time on social media.These computers are all over the wards. 'Previously Twitter and Facebook were blocked but now they\u2019re unblocked, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. But a Trust spokesman defended the move, saying it was intended to promoted 'openness and transparency' within the organisation. A spokeswoman said: 'It is not unusual for NHS Trusts to make social networking sites available for their staff. 'We made the decision to open up access to social networking sites as a result of staff feedback that we needed to explore new ways of ensuring effective communication with our employees across four hospital sites. 'This is one of many actions taken to improve communication with staff and to encourage a culture of trust, openness and transparency within the organisation.' ULHNT was rated among the worst of 11 Trusts placed under \u2018close watch\u2019 after Sir Bruce Keogh\u2019s review into hospital death rates was published in July this year. Inspectors found there had been 12 \u2018never\u2019 events - potentially life-threatening but avoidable mistakes - within the trust. ULHNT announced this week it was to hire dozens of foreign nurses after staffing levels were criticised. A former NHS hospital chief turned whistleblower was paid \u00a3500,000 in a \u2018supergag\u2019 deal to prevent him discussing his concerns about patient safety. Gary Walker, pictured right, said he was asked to \u2018compromise the safety of patients in order to achieve Government targets\u2019 at the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust where he worked. Tory MP Stephen Phillips compared the situation to the scandal at Mid Staffordshire Trust where up to 1,200 patients died \u2018unnecessarily\u2019 because of the focus on targets. He said he suspected there has been a scandal of \u2018similar proportions\u2019 at United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust. Mr Walker, 42, was sacked from his \u00a3140,000-a-year post in February 2010 after allegations that he swore in meetings, but his supporters claimed it was a trumped-up charge. They said that prior to his dismissal, the chief executive \u2013 who rescued the Trust from \u00a324.5million debts \u2013 had a serious disagreement with his superiors over the direction of health policies. He took his employers to a tribunal to claim unfair dismissal, but signed a deal with the Trust before the hearing was due to begin in April last year. The tribunal judge had already found evidence Mr Walker had made disclosures about patient safety, which were protected under whistleblowing laws. The patient mortality rate at the Trust, including the rate for emergency admissions, was above the expected rate for the last three years, according to an independent analysis. Mr Walker\u2019s supporters told the Daily Mail the Trust paid him \u2018hush money\u2019 to prevent the public discovering that senior clinicians had raised concerns about risks to patients. David Bowles, a former chairman of the same Trust who resigned in 2009 over NHS targets, said he had also received a gagging letter after being called as a tribunal witness. He said: \u2018The real question is if you sack somebody and you don\u2019t pay them off, why do you spend \u00a3500,000 trying to cover up what they have to say?\u2019\n\nSummary: United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust implements a new policy to improve patient care by promoting the use of social media for staff communication.

British unit in the Second World War, losing 55,573 of its 125,000 men. In 1940, Winston Churchill praised it . as Britain\u2019s \u2018salvation\u2019. But amid public disquiet at the controversial . tactic of carpet-bombing German\u00a0 cities, he snubbed the airmen in his . 1945 victory broadcast. Expense: Trustees of the Bomber Command Association will be legally liable to foot the bill for the major event in June, attended by 13 members of the Royal Family, if they cannot raise the money . Tribute: A Royal Air Force Lancaster Bomber drops poppies during the opening of the Bomber Command Memorial to commemorate the loss of 55,573 airmen during the Second World War . In June, the sculpture depicting a . crew returning from a mission was unveiled by the Queen in Green Park, . central London, in front of more than 6,500 veterans and widows. The final cost of the ceremony, . including seating, security, insurance and catering, was \u00a3827,000. The . association has received \u00a3270,000 in donations, including \u00a3200,000 from . the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. But the Ministry of Defence reneged on a pledge to match DCMS funding. The pensioners fear they will be forced to sell their homes to meet the six-figure shortfall. Former rear gunner Harry Irons, 88, of . Romford, Essex, who survived 60 missions, said: \u2018I do not know where we . are going to get the money from. There\u2019s talk that we could lose our . houses. \u2018We are very bitter. The MoD was happy enough to send us to war. The Government has a moral responsibility to step in.' Remembering: In June, more than 6,500 war veterans and widows gathered to watch the Queen unveil the sculpture in Green Park of a bomber crew returning from a mission . Honouring: A general view of the Bomber command memorial in Green Park . He added: \u2018They gave us nothing after the war. They were embarrassed about what we did to Germany. But if we hadn\u2019t . done it to them, they would have done it to us. \u2018I saw what our boys went through. It was horrendous.\u2019 Jim Dooley, chairman of the Bomber . Command Memorial Campaign, said: \u2018These guys are heroes \u2013 they saved the . world from Hitler. They don\u2019t deserve the anxiety of possibly having to . sell their homes to fund this memorial. \u2018They played a huge part in ensuring . we remained free yet they have been neglected for decades. Next year is . 70 years since the Dambusters raised the morale of this country with . their daring skill and sacrifice. \u2018The Government should do the right thing. Not to do so would be a gross insult.\u2019 Yesterday a Number 10 spokesman said . there had been official help as \u00a31million was waived in VAT on building . the memorial and the cost of providing RAF personnel and aircraft for . the ceremony was the equivalent of \u00a3375,000.\n\nSummary: Veterans are celebrating as the government agrees to cover the entire cost of the Bomber Command Memorial unveiling, which was attended by the Queen and 13 members of the Royal Family. They have expressed their gratitude to Prime Minister David Cameron for his unwavering support in their campaign. The memorial in London's Green Park honors the 55,573 Bomber Command airmen who perished in the Second World War.",

A set of portraits drawn by one of the key figures in the Profumo Affair has been discovered \u2013 50 years after they were \u2018disposed of\u2019. The pictures were drawn by Stephen Ward, the \u2018fixer\u2019 in the 1960s scandal who was accused of introducing Minister of War John Profumo to showgirl Christine Keeler. The pair enjoyed an illicit affair but after Keeler was subsequently discovered to be sleeping with\u00a0 Russian naval attach\u00e9 Yevgeny Ivanov, Profumo was forced to resign from the Cabinet and Ward was prosecuted for living off the immoral earnings of prostitution. Portraits: Christine Keeler has identified the picture on the left as a portrait of her. The right portrait is said to be of Mandy Rice-Davies. The pictures were drawn by Stephen Ward, the \u2018fixer\u2019 in the 1960s scandal . Leaving court: Christine Keeler (right) with Mandy Rice-Davies (left) leaving the Old Bailey when Stephen Ward was on trial facing vice charges . Lawyers acting for Ward, who committed suicide in 1963 while on trial, considered the portraits sensitive and gave orders for them to be removed from public view. But the artworks, which are reproduced today for the very first time, survived because the clerk of the now-defunct law firm M.\u2009A. Jacobs & Sons secretly gave them to one of his best friends for safe keeping. The distinctive pencil, chalk and charcoal sketches include portraits of 14 sitters, including Keeler\u00a0 and Ivanov. Keeler, who has studied the portraits on behalf of The Mail on Sunday, last night identified a picture of a young woman with her hair in a bun as a portrait of her. Other sitters are believed to include Profumo and Mandy Rice-Davies, a friend of both Ward and Keeler who had a string of affairs with high-profile figures of the day. Ward, who met many of his portrait subjects through his work as a high society osteopath, was instrumental in introducing some of the key players in the controversy to each other and was at the infamous party at Lord Astor\u2019s Cliveden estate where Keeler, who was just 19 at the time, met Profumo. All smiles: Stephen Ward with Christine Keeler in 1963 (left) and one of his drawings, featuring a mystery model (right) Scandal: Mr Ward, the \u2018fixer\u2019 in the 1960s scandal, was accused of introducing Minister of War John Profumo (left) to showgirl Christine Keeler (right) A besotted Profumo, who was then married to actress Valerie Hobson, had no idea Keeler was also sleeping with Ivanov. Ward, who prior to the scandal had been one of the best connected people in London and counted Prince Philip, Princess Margaret, Harold Macmillan and Sophia Loren among his friends, quickly became the scapegoat for the affair. He took an overdose on the day before his trial ended. He was still in a coma on July 31 when the\u00a0 jury found him guilty and he died on August 3, 1963. It is believed the portraits may have been destined for an exhibition at the now-defunct Museum Street Galleries in London\u2019s West End. Artist: Lawyers acting for Ward (pictured), who committed suicide in 1963 while on trial, considered the portraits sensitive and gave orders for them to be removed from public view . At the time of his trial, Ward was represented by flamboyant celebrity lawyer David Jacobs. It is believed that Jacobs ordered his clerk Eddie Marks to get rid of the portraits. But Marks instead decided to give the works to his friend George Olaf Spanswick, an avid art collector. Spanswick died\u00a0 in 1988 but his family held on to\u00a0 the sketches. His daughter Carolyn Bartlett said: \u2018Eddie decided to get rid of the sketches but did it in his own way. He knew my father would look after them.\u2019 Stephen Dorril, who wrote the book Honeytrap about the Profumo Affair, said: \u2018It is quite likely these pictures were among those which were to be shown at the Museum Street Galleries exhibition.\u2019 By Walter Harris . Talented: Stephen Ward's illustrations had attracted the attention of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who gave unique permission for Ward to draw MPs in session in the Commons . On a spring evening in 1960, I went to dinner at a small nightclub called The Paint Box in Foley Street, one of a tangle of narrow thoroughfares between Broadcasting House and Great Titchfield Street in London. The club had a semi-circular stage, around the perimeter of which hung a red curtain. In front of the stage were half a dozen easels, with paper and crayons. The curtain would draw back to reveal a nude sitter in a chair. The club was managed by a tiny model, Adele de Havilland, who tried to increase her height with\u00a0 a beehive hairdo and stiletto heels. On this particular evening, there was only one man sitting at an easel, whose portrait of the model was remarkably accurate. I commented on it to Adele. \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Stephen Ward; he\u2019s getting quite well known as an artist. Would you like to meet him?\u2019 \u2018Yes please.\u2019 She fetched him and, after the introduction, left us to sit down over a drink. Ward had hair brushed straight back, a soft voice and great charm. His talent as an osteopath had brought him patients from the upper reaches of society. His illustrations had attracted the attention of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who as a consequence gave unique permission for Ward to draw MPs in session in the Commons. Ward and I had dinner and became friends, often meeting for coffee. When a distinguished journalist of the day, Brian Inglis, needed an osteopath to review a chapter of a new book on homeopathy he was writing, I suggested Stephen Ward. \u2018I\u2019ve never heard of him, but do bring him round for lunch.\u2019 The three of us had an omelette and a flagon of burgundy, and Stephen took away the chapter for checking. Not long afterwards, he invited me to the first night of an exhibition of his drawings at the Leggatt Brothers\u2019 Gallery in Jermyn Street, mounted as a reward after he healed the neck\u00a0 of one of the brothers which had been broken in a riding accident. Among the sitters attending the exhibition I remember Robert Boothby, who had had a prolonged affair with Lady Dorothy Macmillan, the Prime Minister\u2019s wife; Duncan Sandys, Churchill\u2019s son-in-law and Secretary of State for Defence; and the Conservative MP for Lewes, Major Tufton Beamish. All of them greeted Ward as a friend, the aloof Sandys putting an arm round him. Affair: John Profumo, the newly-appointed Secretary of State for War at the War Office before the scandal of his affair with call-girl Christine Keeler . Then the Profumo Affair hit the headlines, and they, together with the rest of Ward\u2019s society \u2018friends\u2019, were gone, the shelves in his consultancy empty of invitations. Inglis, Ward and I had one more lunch together, at a restaurant in Manchester Square. It was obvious that \u2018Bovine\u2019 Henry Brooke, the Home Secretary, was intent on framing Stephen Ward as a pimp and a Russian spy. \u2018Stephen, what really happened? I\u2019ll guarantee you any organ of communication \u2013 the BBC, The Times, the Sunday Despatch \u2013 to put your side of the case.\u2019 Ward, however, had become a fantasist. \u2018Dear boy, England\u2019s a brothel and Macmillan\u2019s the madame. I\u2019m acting as liaison between Macmillan, Kennedy and Khrushchev in the cause of peace.\u2019 He chuckled; Inglis shrugged in despair. There was now no way to cleanse the smears, no way to win back any social status and no way to deflect the inevitable. Three days after our final lunch, Ward was arrested, and six weeks later died by his own hand.\n\nSummary: Sketches include portraits of 14 sitters, including showgirl Christine Keeler.\nImages drawn by Stephen Ward, the 'fixer' in the 1960s scandal.\nHis lawyers ordered for them to be removed from public view.\nBut a clerk of the law firm secretly gave them to a friend for safe keeping.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Washington (CNN) -- Maybe \"The West Wing\" had it right. A second batch of previously unreleased papers from the Clinton presidency made public Friday revealed a hard-boiled, politically cynical White House mindset similar to the fictional Josiah Bartlet administration of the popular TV show that ran from 1999-2006. Read, search the documents . Highlights from the Clinton memos . Every decision appears based at least in part on a political calculus, and some of the unvarnished back-and-forth shows the human side of the President and other officials that almost always remains well-hidden from public view. Legacy issues . Shortly after Clinton won reelection in 1996, White House aide Gene Sperling drafted a 14-page memo to begin identifying \"legacy goals\" for the President on major policy issues. For a policy to be considered, Sperling wrote, it must be \"Important and Transforming ... Achievable ... Memorable and Identifiable.\" Among the legacy issues Sperling suggested were \"Reforming education\" and \"restoring America's Fiscal Integrity.\" In a 1993 memo on a planned public hearing with then first lady Hillary Clinton to push her proposed health care reforms, aides Alexis Herman and Mike Lux wrote the event would protect the administration from accusations of being closed to outside opinion. \"As we discussed, the primary goal for this two-day hearing would be to inoculate ourselves from charges that we are refusing to listen to all those groups out there that want input,\" said the memo by Herman and Lux. Another part sounded prescient about the continuing health care debate in America almost four years after Obamacare became law. \"Some testifiers should be average people with horror stories, middle-class families worried about the future, and senior citizens,\" the aides wrote. \"These average people should testify during those periods when we believe more people will be watching.\" Tough talk . Other documents include details and transcriptions of planning meetings for Clinton's 1999 State of the Union address that put the full personality and vocabulary of the 42nd President on display. \"Can't say an ass-pocket full of money, can you?\" Clinton asked when discussing how to describe the 1998 budget surplus in the upcoming speech, according to a memo by speechwriter Michael Waldman. His staff also could talk tough, as shown by memos responding to a draft text of Clinton's December 15, 1994, speech following disastrous mid-term elections for Democrats. In seeming unanimity, advisers called the draft too defensive, with one describing it as \"mealy-mouthed.\" \"The President shouldn't whine. He should lead,\" wrote Elaine Kamarck, while Todd Stern noted that \"one of the President's problems right now is that too many people see him as lacking backbone, vacillating, being too eager to please and tell people what they want to hear.\" \"I think he needs to sound strong and Presidential -- in touch certainly, with what happened on Nov. 8 but not weak,\" Stern wrote. The 55 documents totaling more than 4,000 pages released Friday by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library were the second batch of Clinton White House papers made public in recent weeks. Presidential records and the National Archives . The confidential memos, notes and other papers were part of files that had been requested for public release over the years under the Freedom of Information Act, but were withheld by the National Archives due to their sensitive nature. While the Presidential Records Act established public ownership of White House documents as far back as the Reagan administration, it specified that documents pertaining to federal appointments as well as confidential correspondence between the president and his advisers could be withheld from the public for 12 years after a president leaves office. Other documents that can be withheld include classified national security information, confidential business information and trade secrets, and unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. Those types of documents were not part of Friday's release. A Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign could cost $1.7 billion? RNC questions timing of Clinton document release . Earlier: Fighting the first health care war . CNN's Emily Rust, Erin McPike, Mark Preston, Dan Merica, Ashley Killough, Tim McCaughan, Robert Yoon, Steve Brusk and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Newly released papers reveal unvarnished view of the Clinton White House. Politics seemed to always play a role in decision-making. Don't whine, advisers said after disastrous 1994 mid-term election. One adviser urged more personal discipline from Clinton and his team.",

UPDATED: . 19:21 EST, 21 May 2013 . The head of the NHS is to retire early on a \u00a3110,000-a-year pension, following months of mounting pressure over his role in one of the worst-ever hospital scandals. Sir David Nicholson will quit next March with a taxpayer-funded pension pot worth nearly \u00a32million. His position has been under intense\u00a0 scrutiny after a major report implicated him in the Mid Staffordshire hospital\u00a0 disaster, where up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died needlessly. Sir David Nicholson was grilled by MPs over the official report into serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust . Campaigners had repeatedly called for Sir David Nicholson to resign over the Mid Staffordshire NHS scandal . He has also been accused of presiding . over a Stalinist culture across the health service, in which doctors, . nurses and managers are afraid to speak out about poor care. Julie Bailey, of Cure the NHS, said it was 'fantastic news' that Sir David was to leave the health service . Last night bereaved families and MPs questioned the size of his pension and demanded to know why he wasn\u2019t leaving immediately. Although he is due to stay on for . another ten months, he told Health Service Journal he may leave earlier . if a suitable replacement is found. Sir David, who is 57, would normally . be expected to retire when he reached the age of 60. Even in his resignation letter to . Malcolm Grant, chairman of NHS England, he refused to apologise for the . Mid Staffordshire fiasco. He merely said: \u2018Whilst I believe we have made . significant progress together under my leadership, recent events . continue to show that on occasion the NHS can still sometimes fail . patients, their families and carers. \u2018This continues to be a matter of . profound regret to me but please note that on a daily basis I continue, . and will always continue, to be inspired and moved by the passion that . those who work in the NHS continue to show.\u2019 That did little to appease Julie . Bailey, who set up campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella . died at the trust. Describing his pension as \u2018an obscene amount of money . for failure\u2019, she said: \u2018He\u2019s going with his knighthood and pension . still intact. 'He\u2019ll have a happy retirement, unlike us who have been . left with awful memories of watching our loved ones suffer. \u2018We are disappointed he is not going . immediately but hopefully this is a chance to finally change the NHS. We . can start to look to the future now.\u00a0 He was part of the problem \u2013 not . part of the solution. 'We now need a leader who will galvanise and . inspire the front line, not bully them.\u2019 'Cure the NHS' campaigners demanded Sir David resign but he insisted he would stay on in his \u00a3200,000 job . Sir David Nicholson has worked in the NHS since 1977, the same year he joined the Communist party. After working in mental health for a decade, he rose through the ranks to become chief executive of several bodies including the Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority at the time of the care scandal in which up to 1,200 people died. In 2006 he became chief executive of the whole of the National Health Service, in charge of a \u00a390billion budget and 1.3million staff. He claimed \u00a350,000-a-year in expenses on top of a salary of his \u00a3211,000 salary, \u00a320,000 bonus and around \u00a347,000 of \u2018benefits in kind'. The package was criticised at a time when his 'Nicholson Challenge' was imposing \u00a320billion in efficiency savings on the NHS. He insisted he had to travel by first-class to do his job, but refused to explain to MPs why his expense claims included 41 first-class trips to Birmingham, where his 35-year-old wife lives with their baby daughter. He was also accused of overseeing a culture of fear within the NHS where hospitals fiddle their figures and whistleblowers are prevented from speaking out. In a three-year period under his rule a total of \u00a314.7 million was spent on almost 600 \u2018compromise agreements' preventing ex-employees from speaking out. Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who put . down a Commons motion calling for Sir David to resign, said: \u2018It is a . terrible indictment of our political system that he has not already been . fired. \u2018It is an even worse indictment that . in an era where we talk about accountability, he should walk away to an . enormous pension, funded by the public.\u2019 Andrew Bridgen is Tory MP for . Leicestershire North West, and some of his constituents died at . Stafford. He said: \u2018His position was untenable, he had lost confidence . of 90 per cent of NHS staff and more importantly of the patients. \u2018He should go sooner \u2013 as soon as a . suitable replacement is found. I believe we need a new era of honesty . and candour within the NHS and that has to start from the top. \u2018The fact he hasn\u2019t apologised for . the awful events of Mid Staffordshire and elsewhere and his huge pension . will undoubtedly rankle with many.\u2019 Sir David has faced calls to quit . since February, when a high profile report linked him to the appalling . neglect of patients at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust between 2005 and . 2009. Relatives described how elderly patients became so thirsty they . resorted to drinking dirty water from vases, while nurses said they left . wards in tears because care was so poor. Sir David was accused of not taking . action while in charge of the regional health body overseeing the . trust,\u00a0 and later when appointed NHS chief executive in 2006. In fact at the height of the scandal, . in October 2005, he toured the hospital wards and wrote a glowing . letter to managers praising them for hitting targets. But he has . repeatedly insisted that at the time he had \u2018no idea\u2019 of the unfolding . scandal and maintained that the failings were \u2018system wide\u2019. He came under further pressure when . it emerged he had ignored the concerns of two whistleblowers about . another trust, University Hospitals Lincoln, where 670 patients may have . died needlessly. Sir David, who earns \u00a3211,000 a year, . became known as the \u2018man with no shame\u2019 because of his stance over the . scandals. Sir David\u2019s pension pot is currently worth just under . \u00a31.9million, although this will almost certainly increase with inflation . by the time he is due to leave, when it is likely to be more than . \u00a32million. Although his retirement was announced . only yesterday, Government officials are believed to have been planning . it for some time, having realised his position was untenable. And while his letter of resignation . had yesterday\u2019s date at the top, it includes a paragraph which refers to . preparations for reforms beginning on April 1, suggesting it was . written in March. The Mail understands that bosses at . NHS England were lining up possible successors three months ago, despite . publicly giving Sir David their full backing. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: . \u2018[Sir David\u2019s] job has often been incredibly complex and\u00a0 very . difficult, and yet he has always had a reputation for staying calm, and . maintaining a relentless focus on what makes a difference on\u00a0 the NHS . frontline.\u2019 The Francis Inquiry into failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust found up to 1,200 people may have needlessly died as a result of poor care .\n\nSummary: Chief executive of NHS England to quit \u00a3211,000 job in March 2014.\nFaced calls to resign in the wake of Mid-Staffs scandal in which up to 1,200 people needlessly died.\nIn resignation letter he admits the NHS 'can still sometimes fail patients'\nTory MP Charlotte Leslie says vast pension pot is 'sickening'\nResignation letter suggests it has been planned for weeks.",

A leading doctor has warned that Britain will be \u2018swamped\u2019 by tuberculosis unless new measures to diagnose the disease in immigrants are introduced. The disease, which was rife in Britain until the 1950s, is an increasing and worrying problem in urban areas. Rising immigration has seen a surge in cases in the last 20 years. Under current rules, new immigrants from countries where TB is common are required to have chest X-rays before being allowed into Britain. But doctors argue this century-old method only spots active TB once it is already destroying the lungs \u2013 meaning cases are often diagnosed far too late. Other countries such as the U.S. use a blood test, which can detect the latent TB in those not displaying any symptoms. Cases have fallen since this technique was introduced in 2007. At the British Thoracic Society conference this week, Peter Davies of the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, said urgent changes were needed to halt the decades-long rise in TB cases. He told The Times: \u2018The tide has been coming in for 20 years, it\u2019s been getting bigger and bigger and if we don\u2019t do something we will be swamped with TB as we were 100 years ago.\u2019 TB is caused by a bacterium that spreads through saliva. The disease used to be known as consumption because the bacterium ate holes in the lungs. From 50,000 cases a year in Britain in the 1950s, the rate fell to 5,000 in the 1980s. TB is a bacterial infection which is spread by inhaling drops of saliva when an infected person coughs, speaks or sneezes. The disease mainly affects the lungs, . but can travel to other parts of the body including the brain, kidneys, . bones and joints. The disease is curable with a six-month course of . antibiotics, but a drug-resistant form can develop if the course is not . completed. Left untreated it can prove fatal. Symptoms include a persistent cough that . lasts for more than three weeks that gets progressively worse, . unexplained weight loss, fever, night sweats, chest pain, fatigue and . loss of appetite. However, many people who are infected . never develop symptoms - although the bacteria remain in the body, they . are not infectious. Last year there were just over 9,000 cases of TB - a five per cent increase on the year before, according to figures from the Health Protection Agency. The main risk area is still London with 3,588 cases reported in 2011, accounting for 40 per cent of the UK total. And nearly three quarters of those suffering the disease were those not born in the UK. Professor Davies and his peers recommend that people from the Indian subcontinent and sub-Saharan Africa, where rates are highest, should be given the blood test when registering with a GP. Those found to have latent TB can easily eliminate it with a course of antibiotics. Speaking about the blood test, he said:\u00a0 \u2018It\u2019s a no-brainer. If we screen for latent TB we would eliminate the majority of cases of people coming into this country. Now we\u2019ve got the blood tests, for goodness\u2019 sake let\u2019s use them.\u2019 He added that with TB claiming up to 500 deaths a year, the numbers were as many as HIV. The homeless and drug addicts should also be screened because new infections have become more common among these groups, he continued. Mike Mandlebaum, chief executive of the charity TB Alert, said: \u2018The truth is that TB never really went away in the UK and has been steadily rising here, from around 5,000 cases a year at the end of the Eighties to 8,500 in 2007/8. \u2018TB is a disease usually associated with certain high-risk groups such as those with HIV, those from Eastern bloc countries and Asia, and those living in crowded living conditions. But anyone can get it.' Onn Min Kon, a consultant at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Paddington, London, said that rates of the disease are continuing to rise and that the UK has the highest rates in Europe. Last year there were just over 9,000 cases of TB - a five per cent increase on the year before, according to figures from the Health Protection Agency . Echoing the sentiments of Mr Mandlebaum, he said even low risk people are susceptible if the disease is out of control, it being possible to become infected by being in the same room as someone with TB. He added that\u00a0 people should not become careless about the risks because they didn\u2019t fit the traditional demographic of someone who gets the disease. His research has found that a fifth of immigrants to Britain from high-risk areas had latent TB \u2013 but the current guidelines for screening men around 75 per cent of these cases will be missed, so the real figure may be substantially higher. The Department of Health said that in line with NICE guidance, the NHS currently uses both chest X-ray screening and blood-testing to check for TB, with the evidence for new technologies kept under review.\u2019\n\nSummary: 9,000 cases of tuberculosis in the UK last year - up 5% on the year before.\nImmigrants currently screened using chest X-ray.\nBut experts argue this 100-year-old method only spots people with advanced disease, meaning many with no symptoms are missed.\nCalling for blood test used in the U.S. to be standard test.",

UPDATED: . 15:18 EST, 25 November 2013 . Women who suffer from mood swings while going through the menopause can no longer blame it on their hormones, according to a new study. For decades it has been believed the change of life can cause the blues, with tens of millions of women around the world becoming snappy at this time. But the new American research found changes in the levels of the sex hormone oestrogen, which regulates a woman's periods, were not linked to bad temper. Women who suffer from mood swings while going through the menopause can no longer blame it on their hormones, according to a new study . The menopause is caused by a change in the balance of the body's sex hormones. In the lead up to it - perimenopause - oestrogen levels decrease, which causes the ovaries to stop producing an egg each month. But the new research focusing on a post-menopausal group not using hormone therapy found hormone concentrations were not related to memory, thinking or mood. The one exception was progesterone, which was connected with verbal memory and overall cognition in early menopause, but still not mood. The study, published online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to investigate associations between sex hormones and cognition in both younger and older post-menopausal women. It is also the first to determine whether the hormones affect women differently based on their age and how much time has elapsed since they reached menopause. Professor Victor Henderson, of Stanford University in California, said the findings help clarify the role of hormones in age-related brain disturbances. After menopause there is a permanent reduction in a woman's levels of estradiol - the predominant oestrogen beforehand - estrone which is the main one after and progesterone, another hormone involved in the menstrual cycle. The research found hormone concentrations were not related to memory, thinking or mood . Several studies have examined the association between hormone concentrations and cognition but results have been inconsistent. Some researchers have speculated that the effect of oestrogen on cognitive ageing could differ depending on when exposure occurs. Professor Henderson said: 'Some effects might be more beneficial for younger post-menopausal women closer to the time of menopause than for older post-menopausal women.' This is known as the 'critical window.' In a study of 643 middle aged and elderly participants, he sorted his participants - whose ages ranged from 41 to 84 - into those who had gone into menopause less than six years previously and a later group who were beyond ten years. His researchers then gave the women a series of tests to gauge their memory and overall cognition before assessing them for depression and sampling their blood for the hormones. Professor Henderson said: 'We viewed the availability of hormone levels as an opportunity to test one aspect of the critical-window hypothesis - especially since we had two fairly large samples of women.' Based on the critical-window theory - along with past animal studies showing the timing of estradiol replacement affects memory - Prof Henderson had hypothesized higher levels would boost memory in younger menopausal women. He said: 'Instead we found no significant link - positive or negative - in either group.' He said the findings don't 'necessarily mean oestrogens are irrelevant to cognition since we have no way of measuring oestrogen directly at the brain level.' Professor Henderson added: 'But they imply boosting blood levels of estradiol or estrone - even in younger post-menopausal women - may not have a substantial effect on cognitive skills one way or the other.'\n\nSummary: New U.S. research found changes in.\nthe levels of the sex hormone oestrogen, which regulates a woman's.\nperiods, weren't linked to bad temper.\nHormone concentrations were also not related to memory or thinking.",

These are the four miners who were killed in the pit tragedy that devastated a community last week. Pictured together for the first time, David Powell, 50, Charles Breslin, 62, Phillip Hill, 45, and Garry Jenkins, 39, died after a flash flood in the narrow mineshaft. The investigation into the accident at Gleision colliery in the Swansea Valley  which left four dead is expected to focus on concerns over safety levels inside the colliery. As police police prepare to probe the mine owner Gerry Ward, 47, it has been reported that he was previously prosecuted for fly-tipping and, in 2002, for passing off low-quality coal as high-quality. The revelation came as an investigation was launched into a shocking Facebook page that mocked the fate of the four men and families paid tribute to the 'proud miners'. Charles Breslin, 62, (left) was killed alongside Phillip Hill, 45, (right) and two other miners in the accident at Gleision Colliery last week . David Powell, 50, (left) lost his life in the tragedy. Garry Jenkins was killed in the accident . Police received numerous complaints from members of the public who called for action to get the page taken down and a union official condemned the site as 'thoroughly sick'. The Facebook site, which took the form of an online hate campaign targeting the Welsh with racial slurs and trivialising the tragic deaths, appeared to be the work of one person. One comment read: 'In a boost to the failing jobs market in South Wales, 4 new vacancies have been created in the Swansea area from Monday!' 'I hope they catch the people responsible for this as quickly as possible. It is thoroughly sick,' said Ian Morgan, an National Union of Miners official based in the Rhondda Valley. 'Facebook is not the sort of thing I get involved in but whoever is behind this deserves to be arrested and punished in court with the full force of the law. 'I hope they are caught quickly and I urge the police to act with rapidity.' A spokesman for the South Wales Police . confirmed that a significant number of complaints about the site had . been received and it was now under investigation. According to the BBC, Facebook has taken down what it called an offensive page and removed the profiles of its creators. A Facebook spokesman told the broadcaster: 'Online and off, a tiny minority of people are intent on causing offence to others. 'At Facebook, we have built rigorous . reporting tools that enable people to report content that makes them . feel uncomfortable. If content breaches our terms, it will be removed.' Tributes: Flowers lines the street as local people leave notes for the four dead miners left at Cilybebyll near Pontardawe, south Wales . Heartbroken: Floral tributes and notes for the four dead miners were . left at Cilybebyll near Pontardawe, south Wales after the tragedy last . Thursday . Grieving: Families of the miners are calling for the pit to be shut down and sealed up for ever once the investigation is complete . Relatives of the miners have today paid tribute to the 'happy and hard-working\" family men. The families told of the most 'harrowing' time of their lives as they waited with 'increasingly dwindling hope' as rescuers battled to reach them. They said the men were 'proud miners' thanked the rescue teams who risked their own lives in a vain bid to pull them out of the pit. The most poignant tribute came from Garry's seven-year-old son Alex who said: 'Dad was a great darter and a motorbike rider but most of all he was a great dad. 'I am going to miss him, he will always be loved.' Garry's family said he was always happy, hard working and never without a smile on his face.\u00a0 His relatives said: 'He would help anybody he could in any way. 'He lived life to the full enjoying his caravanning and following his family and supporting them in their motocross racing. 'His other passion was playing darts with his good mates at his local.' Relatives of Philip Hill revealed it is the third tragedy to hit the family - his son Simon and mother Merle both died within the last 10 months. A family spokesman said: 'We wish to thank the Mines Rescue teams who worked tirelessly to bring our Philip home safely but sadly in vain. 'Their efforts have not gone unnoticed and without their continual hard work throughout the rescue attempt we would not have our Philip home to allow us to grieve.' Messages of sorrow: Notes were left on a board at St David's Church in Resolven, South Wales - the home of one of the miners who died . Church services across South Wales paid tribute to Phillip Hill, Garry Jenkins, David Powell, and Charles Breslin. The Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan said the tragedy had moved an entire nation and the world . The family also thanked the Red Cross, WRVS volunteers and local shops who donated food and supplies during the 36-hour rescue attempt. Miner Charles Breslin was due to retire but loved the work and comradeship so much he carried on working. The father and grandfather amazed men half his age by managing to shovel 20 tons of coal a day at the small hillside pit. His wife Mavis, 60, said in a statement: 'The terrible accident which robbed Charles of his life has left the whole family without a husband, father and brother. 'The many hours of waiting, with increasingly dwindling hope alongside the families of the other trapped miners were the most harrowing of our lives. 'The dedication and commitment from the emergency services were very much appreciated by all concerned. 'No one could have done more as they bravely raced against the clock and put their own lives in danger. Their bravery should be rewarded.' Keen fisherman Charles was Vice Chairman of the Ystalyfera Royal British Legion and had been a member of Territorial Army. He and Mavis had just completed building their own dream home in the village of Cwmllynfell, four miles from the pit where he died. Mavis added: 'He never had a bad word to say about anyone. He had been a coal miner for most of his working life, a job which his father had done before him, and had worked at most of the small mines in the area during his life. A service is held at St. John the Evangelist church in Cilybebyll, where thoughts and prayers were given for the injured and dead miners. Right, resident look at floral tributes on a small road junction close to Gleision Colliery . Two miners covered in coal dust sit and reflect on the tragedy that has rocked the small mining community . 'The whole family appreciate the many messages of condolences from people who knew Charles, as well as from many sympathisers who had not known him but had we felt shared in our long vigil during rescue efforts.' The family of pit maintenance manager David Powell said: 'He was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, son and true friend. 'Dai was a proud colliery, our life and soul. He brought joy and fun to everyone he met.' Father-of-four Mr Powell was very proud that his son Daniel, 26, followed him down the pit. Daniel was one of the three survivors of last week's tragic flash flood at the small private mine. Meanwhile, investigators entered the . mineshaft for yesterday as they seek to establish the causes of the . accident. Police are also preparing to interview the pit owner. A . spokesman said the team \u2018will draw on technical expertise\u2019, with . specialist mine inspectors working closely with South Wales Police.Key . to their investigations will be statements from survivors. Mr . Powell\u2019s son Daniel, 26, was carrying equipment with Mark Lloyd, 45, a . short distance away from the point where torrents of water filled the . narrow tunnels. Both men escaped unharmed. Mine manager Malcolm Fyfield, 56, who . crawled out of a narrow ventilation shaft, was still fighting for his . life in hospital yesterday. There have been calls for the pit to be shut and sealed once the investigation is complete. It is thought the men were drilling without knowing that thousands of gallons of trapped rainwater were on the other side of the coal seam. Prayers were said in church services across Wales at the weekend, while a fund to offer financial support to the grieving families, supported by Prince Charles, has raised more than \u00a350,000. Among tributes left at St John the Evangelist church in Cilybebyll \u2013 the closest village to the scene of the\u00a0 disaster \u2013 was one from Mr Hill\u2019s eldest daughter Kyla, 11. She placed\u00a0 a bouquet of flowers with a card on which she had written: \u2018Hi dad, I love and miss you forever.\u2019 Her mother Donna, Mr Hill\u2019s widow,\u00a0 left a note which said: \u2018Thank you for being part of our lives. Our girls will be safe with me. Miss you always.\u2019 Mr Ward\u2019s firm, MNS Mining Ltd, said in a statement that it was \u2018totally devastated about everything that has happened\u2019, adding: \u2018Our thoughts are with the families.\u2019\n\nSummary: Families celebrate the survival of four miners after a successful rescue operation at Gleision Colliery.\nThe pit owner is commended for his high safety standards and environmental compliance.\nSocial media supports the Welsh mining community with positive messages and tributes.\nAuthorities conclude natural causes led to the harmless water leak in the mineshaft.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: University Park, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The fatal explosions at the Upper Big Branch coal mine in West Virginia and the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the Louisiana coast drive home important truths about our country's energy supplies. The first is that energy extracted from these sources is so valuable for our society that companies can afford to pay their workers premiums to risk their lives in dangerous circumstances. Massey Coal was extracting coal at Upper Big Branch at a cost of $35 per ton, and selling it for $60 per ton. BP and Transocean were extracting oil from Deepwater Horizon at a cost of $50 per barrel and selling it for $80 per barrel . The second is that there are no simple solutions to U.S. energy challenges. Wherever we get our energy, the price we pay for it is high. We should consider this seemingly obvious fact when we talk about moving toward an economy that uses less carbon in order to combat climate change. Make no mistake: This move will be costly and is not likely to happen any time soon. Scholars at Resources for the Futures, a Washington, D.C., environmental think tank, estimate that enactment of the Waxman-Markey bill (the American Clean Energy and Security Act) currently pending before the Senate will cost the average ratepayer anywhere from $136 to $413 per year. The reality is our economy is set up to burn coal for electricity and gasoline for cars, and moving away from this will be difficult, time consuming, and will compel consumers to decide whether they think it is worth it. Almost half of the electricity produced in the United States comes from coal, which is cheap, plentiful and secure. Yet besides the dangers to coal miners, coal comes with its own costs. Burning it for electricity creates sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. Scientists and engineers are working on making coal cleaner. One promising approach is carbon sequestration, in which carbon is separated out after burning coal. But once the carbon is separated, it is not clear what will be done with it. The best ideas involve storing it underground in former natural gas reservoirs. Making such storage facilities viable, however, will involve laying pipelines to transport highly compressed carbon dioxide hundreds of miles, likely against strong local opposition. Thus, for the foreseeable future, we are going to be using a lot of dirty coal. Oil has its own deficiencies in terms of pollution and safety of extraction. Burning oil creates a variety of noxious chemicals, as well as carbon dioxide. And, as the oil spill from Deepwater Horizon demonstrates, we will never be able to eliminate environmental threats from drilling. But right now, it is the only thing we have to propel most of our cars. Someday, electric cars may be able to take us farther than the local shopping mall. But even then, we'll have to get the needed power from an already overburdened electricity grid. Many have held up wind and solar power as the saving solutions for our energy future. But these energy sources, which provide about 2 percent of the nation's electricity, have their own drawbacks and hurdles. For example, promising offshore wind projects have been canceled because of local environmental concerns. Indeed, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar is scheduled to make a decision on a wind power project off the coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts this week that has faced opposition from fisherman, local Indian tribes and tourism concerns. After years of discussion, there have still been no offshore wind turbines built in the U.S. And by itself, solar power is clean. But the needed rare-earth elements (such as dysprosium and terbium) are extracted through processes that are less than green. For example, extracting the elements from the raw materials mined requires a great deal of difficult-to-dispose-of and highly dangerous acids. (Rare-earth elements are also used in hybrid car motors.) Further, these elements come from China, giving the Chinese government power over our energy policies. But beyond that, there may be limits -- at least for the foreseeable future -- to how much our electricity grid can depend on wind and solar power. This all revolves around a particular word: \"intermittency.\" A modern society requires that nonstorable electricity be available at all times to meet electricity demand, without a significant threat of blackouts. Unfortunately, wind and solar power are intermittent -- they depend on weather conditions, which can vary. Given this, there is a serious question as to how much the electricity grid can rely on these energy sources. Whether consumers will be willing to pay for green energy remains an open question. One example comes from Pennsylvania's restructured electricity markets. In these markets, residential customers have the option of paying for \"green\" power, mostly from wind sources, and somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of residential customers do so. This green power, however, raises electricity bills about 15 to 20 percent. Moving toward a greener economy will further raise these costs, as it will become harder and harder to find green power sources. If we want to address our country's energy concerns, we have to be willing to face one important fact: that creating such solutions will not be cheap. Different forms of energy are available, but using them will result in raising our electricity and gasoline bills significantly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Kleit.\n\nSummary: Andrew Kleit argues that the transition to renewable energy sources is underway and affordable, with wind and solar power leading the charge in reducing our reliance on coal and oil. He suggests that the recent disasters in coal mining and oil drilling have accelerated the shift towards a green economy, which will soon offer a cheaper and safer alternative for both electricity and transportation. Kleit emphasizes the importance of embracing these new technologies to ensure a sustainable and secure energy future.",

Of course, Romney has retracted his remark. But if he still wants to attack those who freeload off of U.S. taxpayers, there is a better target: Our wealthy overseas allies. Forty-seven percent is also roughly the U.S. share of global military spending. Our annual $700 billion-plus military budget exceeds the next 10 biggest military budgets combined. Much of that money buys forces needed to defend allies against threats they could afford to meet themselves. Alliances that once served the U.S. national interest have become a subsidy to rich allies. In a recent foreign policy speech, Romney noted that only three of the 28 NATO allies meet their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense. He promises to fix that by asking our allies to honor their commitment to security spending. But the Europeans have grown adept at keeping a straight face while ignoring such lectures. If Romney wants them to do more, he should suggest giving them less -- a logic he appreciates in domestic contexts. The same would apply to the Japanese, South Koreans and various others we defend. Some allies, especially in Asia, might increase military spending. Others, noting less danger and bulging debts, may not. Washington is not the best judge of others' needs. But with fewer commitments, we can maintain fewer forces and lower future military costs, which means more savings for U.S. taxpayers. As long as the United States bears the lion's share of global defenses, our allies have little incentive to do more. As we saw in Libya in 2011, the U.S. Air Force enabled NATO's intervention by providing air refueling, intelligence and precision strike capability. Our combat-tested Army and Marine Corps are the envy of their counterparts around the world, many of whom they train. Our special operations forces track terrorists everywhere. Romney complains that our Navy has fewer ships than before World War I but fails to mention that it is far bigger than any other fleet and is the police force of the global seas. Romney has insisted that U.S. exceptionalism compels us to steady alliances, settle regional disputes and forcefully promote democracy everywhere. But he has reversed the idea of U.S. exceptionalism. Early American leaders thought that the nation's virtue lay in liberal values and the example America sets. For them, U.S. exceptionalism had nothing to do with military adventurism. Permanent allies might drag us into others' disputes, imperiling liberalism by centralizing power in the presidency and requiring a massive military establishment. Similar worries encouraged President Eisenhower's push to keep our commitments to allies temporary. In 1953, Western Europe and Japan were still recovering from World War II and South Korea, with our help, was still fighting the North and its Chinese allies. U.S. commitments to defend those nations came from fear that the Soviet Union would capitalize on their weakness, through conquest or internal intrigue, and gather enough strength to threaten us directly. Those allies long ago grew rich enough to defend themselves, and the Soviet Union has been history for decades. The European Union collectively has a population and economy larger than ours. But while Americans spend about $2,700 per capita annually on the military, NATO allies average around $500. More than 20 years after the end of the Cold War, Europeans sit in cafes while over 80,000 American service personnel still help guard Europe against Russia, which now has a GDP around the size of Spain and Portugal combined. Sixty years after the end of Korean War, nearly 30,000 American forces still shield the South against a Northern neighbor with a 25th of its wealth and half its population. We have almost 50,000 troops in Japan almost 70 years after its surrender. Japan spends only about 1% of its GDP on its military, provides no troops to help stabilize Afghanistan, but insists that U.S. Marines defend their every rocky island in a possible dispute with China. Romney still has time to change his mind on this issue. Rather than lecturing our allies about their responsibilities, we should kick them off the dole, rescinding commitments to their defense and removing troops from their shores. This is a problem that any president faces, including President Obama. But Romney may make the problem worse through his proposed increase in military spending. If that seems chintzy, remember that there is virtue in economy and that we have needier causes at home, starting with the deficit. That tack might also prove politically useful: polls show that Americans would prefer to do less for rich allies. And foreign freeloaders can't vote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harvey Sapolsky and Benjamin Friedman.\n\nSummary: Harvey Sapolsky, Benjamin Friedman: Our annual military budget is large. Sapolsky, Friedman: Mitt Romney should suggest less military spending on our allies. They say our allies are rich enough to defend themselves instead of relying on the U.S. Sapolsky, Friedman: Lower military costs will mean more savings for U.S. taxpayers.",

The teenage mother of a\u00a0 one-year-old girl in foster care who went missing during a supervised visit has been arrested on suspicion of kidnap after the child was found safe and well, police said today. Little Lola Page, 13 months, was found with her mother, Stacey Ball, 18, at an address in Willenhall, near Walsall in the West Midlands at 1am today, police said.\u00a0 The child had been missing since Friday lunchtime, when she disappeared during a visit by her mother to the foster family she had been living with. Officers arrested Ball and another man at the address where they found them, and a short while later arrested two more men in the village of Walsall Wood, eight miles away. Stacey Ball, 18, has been arrested after police found her with Lola, 13 months, in Willenhall, West Midlands . Ball had been visiting her daughter, who was in foster care in Willenhall, when the child went missing on Friday .

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Newly released documents from Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor's service on the board of a Puerto Rican civil rights organization show the group opposed Robert Bork's nomination to the high court more than two decades ago. Judge Sonia Sotomayor is set to face Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Sotomayor, a judge on the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, was nominated by President Obama in May to fill the vacancy of retiring Justice David Souter. Her confirmation hearings are set to begin July 13. She served as a board member of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980-92, leaving when she became a federal judge. During her years on the PRLDEF board, the group opposed President Reagan's 1987 nomination of the conservative Bork -- then a federal appeals judge -- \"because of the threat he poses to the civil rights of the Latino community,\" according to the documents. The group's attorneys prepared press releases and \"worked on numerous efforts to build coalitions against the nominee,\" according to the documents. Bork was ultimately rejected by the Senate. The Fund also met in 1987 with staff at the New York Daily News to address what it called \"negative images of Puerto Ricans presented by the News' staff,\" including well-known columnist Jimmy Breslin. Republicans are challenging Sotomayor's record on affirmative action, and the newly released documents on her work at the Fund will likely be a centerpiece of debate at the upcoming confirmation hearings. The 350 pages of documents released Wednesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee show the Fund filed hundreds of discrimination lawsuits over the years on behalf of Hispanics. The documents do not reveal whether Sotomayor was directly involved in them. She was a private attorney at the time, and was volunteering for the group. However, they reflect the Fund's strong push to establish a precedent of cases that would establish legal authority to uphold workplace quotas for minorities. One case dealt with promotions in the New York City Police Department. A May 1992 memo on \"litigation highlights\" noted, \"We obtained quota promotions for Latinos and African Americans to the rank of sergeant.\" A PRLDEF class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of minority applicants claimed advancement exams were \"discriminatory and not job related.\" The city settled, agreeing to promotions that reflected the percentage of Hispanic test-takers. Backpay and retroactive seniority were also provided. \"As a result,\" said the memo, \"almost 100 Hispanics were promoted, over twice the number that would have been promoted without the settlement.\" Fast forward 17 years to a case Sotomayor heard as an appeals judge. She and her colleagues rejected a lawsuit by white firefighters in New Haven, Connecticut, after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because too few minorities qualified for advancement. In the case, one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters who scored high on the exams and would have gained captain and lieutenant positions claimed \"reverse\" discrimination. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the so-called \"New Haven 20,\" concluding \"the city rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates were white.\" Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority said, \"No individual should face workplace discrimination based on race.\" The high court said municipalities would now have to establish \"a strong basis of evidence\" that promotion tests were unfairly designed or administered before nullifying them, and not simply because too many minorities did poorly. Sotomayor's views in the case have been criticized by some conservatives, saying it shows she supports racial preferences for Hispanic and other minorities. The high court dissent, however, criticized the ruling for reinterpreting what Congress intended. \"Congress endeavored to promote equal opportunity in fact, and not simply in form,\" wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"The damage today's decision does to that objective is untold.\" Supporters also contend the PRLDEF documents add nothing to the nomination debate. \"Documents that Judge Sotomayor did not write, or approve -- many of them more than two decades old -- are irrelevant to her nomination,\" according to a White House statement. \"The Senate should judge her on her own record -- especially her judicial record -- not on briefs that other lawyers wrote 20 years ago.\" Opponents, however, claim Sotomayor's prior work for PRLDEF, and her off-the-bench comments reveal doubts about her fairness and impartiality as a judge. In addition, some Republicans on the committee expressed concern the material was released only 12 days before the hearings begin. \"This has all the hallmarks of a deliberate delay and an attempt to frustrate a thorough review of this important information,\" said Stephen Boyd, a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, ranking Republican on the committee. \"If these dilatory tactics continue, it will be increasingly more difficult for the hearing to go forward on July 13.\" Sotomayor supporters point out a similar \"document dump\" by the Bush White House in the days before Chief Justice John Roberts testified before the Senate in September 2005. And the Bush administration also refused to turn over material from Justice Samuel Alito's prior service in the Reagan and Bush Justice Departments in the 1980s, arguing his subsequent judicial record was sufficient to determine his qualifications to sit on the high court.\n\nSummary: Sotomayor led the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund's fight against the nomination of Robert Bork. Critics argue her judicial record shows bias in favor of affirmative action policies.",

UPDATED: . 13:36 EST, 7 February 2013 . A new commuter rail concourse is being built 16 stories below Grand Central Station as part of a $15billion development. An army of workers is blasting through bedrock to create the shiny new area that will have more floor space than New Orlean's Superdrome. It is one of three hidden projects going on beneath the streets of New York City to expand what is already the nation's biggest mass transit system. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the Second Avenue Subway at 46th Street in New York City, part of $15billion improvements to the subway . A planned Mezzanine elevator in the Second Avenue Subway will look like this artist's impression in the planned works to ease congestion on Lexington Avenue trains . The most dramatic project will result in a . sort of 21st century, underground Grand Central Terminal mirroring the . century-old Grand Central Terminal above -a 350,000-square-foot, $8.3 . billion commuter rail concourse with six miles of new tunnels. Even with blasting and machinery grinding through the rock day and night, most New Yorkers are unaware of the construction below ground that includes a massive, eight-story cavern, miles of tunnels and watery, gravel-filled pits. Engineer Michael Horodniceanu, president of capital construction for the state Metropolitan Transportation Authority said: 'I look at it and I'm in wonder, I'm in awe. 'I feel like when I went to Rome and entered St. Peter's Basilica for the first time. I looked at it and said, \"Wow, how did they do that?\"' In New York, they hauled out so much rocky debris from under Grand Central that it could have covered Central Park almost a foot deep, Horodniceanu says. Together, the three projects will cost an estimated $15 billion. And when they're all completed, estimated for 2019, they will bring subway and commuter rail service to vast, underserved stretches of the city, particularly the far East and West sides of Manhattan. 'They'll be a game-changer for New Yorkers,' says Horodniceanu. It will accommodate Long Island Rail Road trains that now bypass Manhattan's East Side as they roll east through Queens and straight to Pennsylvania Station on the island's West Side. This so-called East Side Access will bring about 160,000 passengers a day from Long Island to a new station in Queens' Sunnyside neighborhood, then about five more miles to the new, eight-track Grand Central hub. It is currently a construction site about five football pitches long. The Federal Transit Administration is kicking in $2.7 billion toward the estimated $8.3 billion budget, with the MTA state agency covering the rest using mostly taxpayer money. Crews have carved out tunnels and were preparing to lay down concrete on the construction of the Second Avenue Subway . Hundreds of workers are busy underground but are barely noticed by New Yorkers above . Also under construction is the Second Avenue Subway that eventually will serve Manhattan's far East Side, from Harlem to the island's southern tip. The planned eight miles of track will open Manhattan's East Side to millions of people who now squeeze daily onto the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 subway trains running under Lexington Avenue. Dubbed the 'The Line That Time Forgot,' the Second Avenue Subway has been a New York City dream since the 1920s. Then came the Great Depression and World War II, followed by lack of funds that stopped the project after several stretches of tunnel with tracks were built in the 1970s. The existing tunnels are now being incorporated into the new ones. The first phase - 1.7 miles with stations between East 63rd and East 96th streets - is to be completed in 2016 at a cost of $4.5 billion. Funding and plans for the rest of the route are still up in the air. Finally, there's the extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to a huge new real estate development on Manhattan's Far West Side, New York's biggest besides the World Trade Center. It's called Hudson Yards, a small urban village of high-rises, parkland, retail businesses and cultural institutions in the West 30s. Moody's Investors Service calls this subway extension - financed through $2.1billion worth of city-issued bonds - 'a key milestone towards attracting development.' 'These are vital projects, and they'll reinforce the infrastructure of the city,' says Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University. 'It's not just about people going to work; the New York subway and rail systems are busy 24 hours a day, taking people shopping, to theaters, to clubs.' The city's 468 subway stations register more than 1.6billion rides a year. The system is used by more than 5 million daily riders. The Metro in Washington, D.C., has about 800,000, and San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit has about 400,000. The three mammoth projects require creative solutions and the latest technology. The artist's impression of the new concourse is a far cry from the average New York subway . When crews prepared to drill the giant new cavity under Second Avenue, they first had to freeze the ground to about minus 20 degrees so as not to destabilize the buildings above as the boring machine cut through. For that, aluminum tubes were inserted from the street and a special chemical solution was poured into the ground and cooled by a refrigeration plant. The Second Avenue tunnels hold a space-age surprise: The ceilings are coated with a material once used to fireproof the space shuttle. The new line has another major improvement. Instead of ventilation grates that allow rainwater to pour in, the new stations will be aired using enclosed cooling plants. When Superstorm Sandy hit the city last October, floodwaters washing over the East Side did not penetrate subway construction sites. 'We're using the best technology available today, but this is really people-intensive work,' says Horodniceanu, who supervises a team of thousands of workers on any given day. 'I feel I have the most exciting job in the world,' he says. 'It's an incredible feeling to be able to build a legacy project. I hope that one day, my grandchildren will be able to say their granddad built this.'\n\nSummary: Work is part of $15billion improvements to the New York subway system. A 350,000sq ft commuter concourse with six miles of tunnels will be built. Engineers say improvements will be a 'game changer' and ease congestion.",

Standing awkwardly on a Manhattan street on December 17, the 69-year-old newsman can be seen looking at his lover, 41-year-old Lisan Goines, who is grinning back at him - just blocks from the Upper West Side home he shares with his wife, Jennet Conant, author of 'A Covert Affair'. The pair, who are both married, met for drinks at the five-star Essex Hotel and were later seen kissing in the back of a cab, according to\u00a0the National Enquirer. Kroft has admitted to the affair, calling it 'a serious lapse in personal judgment' after the magazine revealed that the duo had carried on a three-year relationship and published their raunchy texts. Scroll down for video . Together: Steve Kroft is pictured with his attorney lover Lisan Goines in New York City on December 17. The CBS news correspondent has admitted to the affair, calling it a 'serious lapse of personal judgment' 'My wife and I are committed to each other and are working hard to get past this,' he told the\u00a0New York Post. The 60 Minutes correspondent, who is married with one son, and Goines hooked up in hotels across Manhattan and Washington, D.C. after meeting at a bar in 2011, it reported. Kroft had spotted Goines - who was then engaged to be married - from across the room in the St Regis and went to talk to her and her friend. While her friend was using the restroom, 'Steve quickly told Lisan, \"I have to see you again\",' a source said. A few weeks later, they arranged to meet for cocktails and afterwards, he handed her a room key so he could be alone with her, convincing her he was in a sexless marriage, the Enquirer reported. Throughout their affair, Kroft and Goines exchanged a series of racy text messages, including one in which he told her he 'would rather be eating your pudding' than be at work. 'Don't work too hard this week bc I wanna wear you out afterward,' Goines reportedly replied. 'Mistress': 41-year-old Goines, who is also married, met 69-year-old Kroft in a hotel bar in 2011 . Together: Kroft, pictured with his wife in May 2014, said they were working hard to get past the affair . In another message, he told her: 'Miss you and all that goes with it. Especially my favorite tastes and colors... pink and brown,' according to the publication. He also asked her what her 'preference' would be, and she reportedly responded: \u00a0'U all over and deep inside of me,' she reportedly responded. Sources also revealed the couple's bedroom habits, including his use of Viagra and how he poured champagne in her behind before drinking it. But while their affair began at the $700-a-night Four Seasons hotel, it quickly lost its luxurious edge and went 'kind of low end', a source said. She would often meet him while he was working in Washington D.C. and once asked him to buy her a ticket, and he agreed but only footed the bill that once, the report added. 'The whole thing soured because she got to the point where it was only about Steve,' a source said. They added that Goines never had any intention of leaving her husband and did not want Kroft to leave his wife, so ended it - until they were spotted out in Manhattan together on December 17. Questions: Kroft, pictured left in 1992 with Al Gore (center) and Bill Clinton (right) famously confronted Clinton about his womanizing during an interview during his election campaign in 1992 . The reports come more than two decades after Kroft confronted Bill Clinton over his womanizing when he was Arkansas governor. He has been married to Conant, 55, for 23 years. She is a journalist and author of four books about World War II, including three New York Times bestsellers, including 'A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'. The couple lives in New York and they have one son, John. Kroft joined CBS in 1980 and has been with 60 Minutes for 26 years.

Forriest often entertains Eagles fans with his singing outside the stadium, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. Forriest told police that he took off his leg because it was hurting him. It was on the back of his motorized wheelchair when an intoxicated woman in Eagles gear jumped in his lap and broke his microphone, he told CNN affiliate KYW. The woman, who appeared to be in her 20s, then grabbed the leg and ran off. \"She said, 'I will pay you for (the microphone).' I said, 'That's all right, baby, go ahead and have a good time,' and then she disappeared,\" Forriest said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said authorities obtained intelligence about a \"demonstration killing\" -- a killing, Australian media reported, in which alleged assailants planned to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and then drape him or her in an ISIS flag. The foiled plot comes just days after the country raised its terror alert to high and in the midst of Australia committing to helping the United States and a broad international coalition to beat back the Islamic State, or ISIS. The militant group has been slaughtering people and taking over villages in Syria and Iraq. One of its members beheaded two Western journalists and an aid worker -- brutality that was videotaped and broadcast throughout the world. ISIS vows that it will stop at nothing to create a caliphate governed by the intensely strict Sharia law. Suspects arrested, detained . Earlier Thursday, at least one person had been arrested and charged with terrorism offenses and another 14 were detained as police conducted more than two dozen searches in Sydney, acting Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said at a news conference. Hours later, police said nine people who were detained have been released. A 24-year-old man from Merrylands has been charged with possession of ammunition without a license and unauthorized possession of a prohibited weapon, authorities said. Another man has also stood in court, charged with conspiracy to commit acts in preparation of a terrorist act and financing terrorism, police said, and two women were issued notices to appear later in court. Their names have not been released. Authorities declined to give details about the threat, citing an ongoing operation. But Abbott told reporters that intelligence revealed that Islamic militants inside Australia were planning to kill. \"The exhortations, quite direct exhortations, were coming from an Australian who is apparently quite senior in ISIL (Islamic State) to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country,\" he said. Early morning raids . More than 800 law enforcement officials fanned out across Sydney suburbs as part of a coordinated operation to serve 25 search warrants. \"Today's operation reflects the reality of the threat we actually face,\" said Andrew Scipione, commissioner of New South Wales Police. A second series of searches were carried out in Brisbane, Scipione said. Those searches were connected to the arrests earlier this month of two men in Brisbane accused of recruiting and financing foreign fighters to Syria. The commissioner said authorities are looking for links between the Sydney operation and the one in Brisbane. Meanwhile, police presence has been increased at Parliament because of security threats, Abbott told Channel 7 on Friday. Citing an intelligence review carried out in recent days, Abbott said federal police will be taking over security inside and outside of Parliament. Terror alert raised to 'high' Australia last week raised its terror alert level to \"high\" for the first time since the national alert system was introduced in 2003. It's the second-highest alert level. According to the four-level system, a reading of \"high\" means a terrorist attack is likely. The decision to raise the level was foreshadowed by the departing director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) last week. David Irvine said the threat level had been building in Australia over the last year, due to the increasing influence of Australian jihadists who had gone to fight for ISIS in the Middle East and then returned home. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Irvine said more than 20 Australians had returned home after fighting in Iraq or Syria, and about 60 Australians are currently fighting with extremist groups. Australia joins anti-terror coalition . This week, the Australian government was one of 40 nations that agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS, the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State. The government has agreed to send military advisers to Iraq, and it will deploy a number of aircraft, including fighter jets, to the United Arab Emirates. It also will also help to stem the humanitarian crisis. Australian combat troops will not participate in ground fighting, according to Abbott.\n\nSummary: Security ramped up at Parliament, PM Tony Abbott says.\nPolice say charges were filed against two men.\nAbbott says intelligence pointed to possible \"demonstration killing\" by militants.",

You could therefore play 'Words With Friends' during your entire trip and nobody would give you any grief over it,\" Leach tells Baldwin in the letter.

UPDATED: . 19:16 EST, 11 September 2013 . A dedicated volunteer with the ambulance service has been sacked for breaking the speed limit during an emergency call-out. Godfrey Smith, who has been a \u2018first responder\u2019 for 15 years, was sent to help a man in July, but bosses who later examined his ambulance\u2019s sat-nav sacked him when it revealed he drove at 33mph in a 20mph zone. Although Mr Smith drives a marked ambulance and provides life-saving care prior to the arrival of overstretched NHS paramedics, as a volunteer first responder he does not have the same rights to break road laws as fully-fledged ambulance drivers. In shock: Volunteer Community First Responder Godfrey Smith had his services dispensed with by South Central Ambulance Service for driving 33mph in a 20mph zone . Saving lives: Mr Smith doesn't deny speeding down an Oxford shopping street but says he was responding to an urgent patient call . Yesterday the 64-year-old said: \u2018I\u2019m absolutely devastated. My life has revolved around volunteering and helping people when they most need it. \u2018It is soul-destroying being told I can no longer do it. I feel like my heart has been ripped out.\u2019 He was called by controllers on July 23 and sent to the St Clement\u2019s area of Oxford to give emergency treatment to a man who had collapsed with breathing problems. He jumped into his marked South Central Ambulance Service Land Rover to rush to the address, however, following a complaint, he was dismissed for \u2018breaching road traffic law\u2019. Bosses who investigated the incident found data on Mr Smith\u2019s\u00a0 satellite navigation system which showed he was travelling at 13mph faster than he should have done down a high street. He was also criticised for going to the right of a \u2018keep left\u2019 bollard. But Mr Smith said the sat-nav did not pick up that the road was a new 20mph zone and was still showing a 30mph limit, and that he drove around the bollard to get past traffic. He added: \u2018If I thought it was dangerous, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. There was no traffic coming the other way; the lights were on red.\u2019Mr Smith received a letter last week notifying him of the ambulance service\u2019s decision. Extenuating circumstances: Mr Smith received an urgent call and drove too quickly down High Street and Longwall Street, pictured, in Oxford. He also drove around a bollard to get ahead of traffic . He said: \u2018There was no thanks whatsoever for my 15 years of service. I do not condone speeding but the punishment is brutal. \u2018This has hit me harder than the death of my own parents. The ambulance service has broken my heart. I have shed tears over this. It meant everything.\u2019 The decision to dismiss him comes just three months after the same ambulance service issued an urgent plea for volunteers after\u00a0 its number of drivers dropped from 45 to 28. A spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said at the time that the county needed 90 extra ambulances to meet life-saving response times targets. During his time as a volunteer first responder, Mr Smith attended more than 2,000 call-outs and saved numerous lives, calling it the \u2018most rewarding thing you can do\u2019. He added: \u2018If there is even a slim chance of saving someone then I am there \u2013 at least they will have a chance. I get people coming up to me in the street saying \u201cyou saved my child\u201d, or \u201cyou helped my mum.\u201d\u2009\u2019 Several hundred people in the Oxford area have now signed a petition calling for Mr Smith to be reinstated. One man whose life was saved by Mr Smith condemned the decision to sack him. Father-of-two David Hatton, who was treated by Mr Smith in 2007 when he suffered a massive heart attack at home, said yesterday: \u2018It is very petty. If it was not for Gof I would not be walking around today and my children would not have a father.\u2019 Support: At least 60 people have signed a petition supporting the sacked man since Monday . Mr Smith\u2019s son, performing arts student Matthew, 19, who also worked as a first responder, has now resigned in support of his father. He said: \u2018I had to stand by my father. He has dedicated a large part of his life to the service and I know it would be difficult for him. \u2018As well as his job, he would do at least 20 hours a week volunteer work with the service, and most of it was overnight. He has spent most Christmases and New Year\u2019s Eves going out to emergencies. I can\u2019t even tell you the last time I spent a New Year\u2019s Eve with my father, as he has always been out on calls.\u2019 Ambulance drivers employed by the trust have to get to 75 per cent of most serious calls in eight minutes, and the latest figures, for July, show it hit 84 per cent of its target in Oxfordshire. A spokesman for campaign group Patient Concern said: \u2018We think it\u2019s outrageous. The priority is saving lives rather than complying with road regulations.\u2019 A letter to Mr Smith from the trust said: \u2018It is felt that your standard of driving on this occasion fell far below that required of someone driving a SCAS marked vehicle.\u2019 SCAS refused to comment on Mr Smith\u2019s case. Volunteer: Those supporting Godfrey Smith have said his dismissal will be a huge loss to South Central Ambulance Service .\n\nSummary: Godfrey Smith, a volunteer ambulance driver in Oxford, was honored for his 15 years of service by the South Central Ambulance Service after safely exceeding the speed limit during an emergency.

In Syria's first outbreak of the disease since 1999, 10 cases of polio were initially confirmed among children last month. That number has now risen to 17, the WHO said. In addition to 15 cases confirmed in Deir Ezzor province, \"two additional cases have been confirmed, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, confirming widespread circulation of the virus,\" the WHO said in a statement. It said the risk of further spread of the disease was considered high given the fighting, large-scale movement of refugees and number of children who have not been fully immunized in the country. Last month, health officials launched a program to immunize 1.6 million Syrian children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella -- in government- and rebel-held areas. The response, which also includes neighboring countries, is expected to last at least six months, the WHO has said. \"A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended supplementary immunization activities with oral polio vaccine,\" the WHO said. About 22 million children under the age of 5 are being targeted in mass polio vaccination campaigns in the region, it said. According to UNICEF, 500,000 children in Syria have not been vaccinated against polio. The highly infectious viral disease, which spreads via fecal-oral transmission and contaminated food and water, primarily affects young children. Initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis and death. It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries -- Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988. Public health can be among the first casualties of war, as resources are diverted from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines. According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters.

Alex Ferguson's team kept a clean sheet for the first time in six games, beating West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at home in a match that had been in danger of succumbing to the UK's recent wet weather. By contrast, second-placed Manchester City scrambled a 4-3 win at Norwich, Tottenham came from behind to claim third with a 2-1 victory at Sunderland and Arsenal moved fifth after triumphing 7-3 at home to Newcastle. All eight EPL matches provided goals -- 35 in all -- with Stoke drawing 3-3 with Southampton, Wigan beating Aston Villa 3-0, Swansea winning 2-1 at Fulham and Reading ending a long winless run by defeating West Ham 1-0. United edged a controversial seven-goal thriller against Newcastle on Wednesday, showing the defensive frailties that have plagued the 19-time English champions this season, but the return of Nemanja Vidic helped steady the side against a West Brom team that has dropped to seventh place. The visitors went behind in the ninth minute when Gareth McAuley deflected Ashley Young's cross past his own keeper -- former United player Ben Foster -- and substitute Robin van Persie wrapped it up at the end with a curling shot for his league-leading 14th goal this season. Ferguson was widely criticized for harassing match officials during the Newcastle match and for claiming that Van Persie \"could have been killed\" during the 1-1 draw with Swansea, but he kept his comments low-key this time. \"The pitch was a problem for us with the way we pass the ball -- it slowed our game down a bit,\" said Ferguson, who turns 71 on Monday. \"We did well in the first half, we dominated at times, but you must give credit to West Brom who had more of the game in the second half and were a threat with their crosses. \"They had quite a bit of possession into the second period so we decided to bring Robin and Paul Scholes on just to settle us down a bit and they did that well. \"It's a good result considering how heavy the pitch was -- that's two games in four days on it and it's not easy. The slowness of it killed our speed.\" Blog: Has Ferguson gone too far? West Brom boss Steve Clarke agreed with the officials' decision to go ahead with the match after a late inspection of the waterlogged pitch. \"We used to play on pitches like that all the time. You don't look for games to be called off for no reason and there was no reason today,\" he said. Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini was not so happy after his defending champions bounced back from the 1-0 defeat by Sunderland. Recalled striker Edin Dzeko scored twice inside four minutes, but Norwich got back into the game after Samir Nasri was sent off just before halftime following an altercation with Sebastien Bassong. \"Both players came forward with their heads, so if you are going to send off one, then you have to send off both, not only Samir,\" Mancini said. \"I am disappointed with Samir, and he will pay his fine, but the decision was not correct.\" The Italian will go into the New Year trying to retrieve a sizable deficit, though City overhauled United's eighth-point lead last season to win the club's first title since 1968. \"It's not important to look at the table because it's not final but we need only to work, to win and then maybe we'll look again at the table in February,\" he said. Dzeko almost had a hat-trick, but his 67th-minute shot hit the post and went into the net off Norwich goalkeeper Mark Bunn for 4-2, which was ruled to be an own goal. Russell Martin netted his second on 75, but Norwich stayed 11th after a third successive defeat. Tottenham moved a point above London rivals Chelsea, who travel to sixth-placed Everton on Sunday. Sunderland went ahead against the run of play as skipper John O'Shea scored his first goal for the club five minutes before halftime, but Carlos Cuellar headed into his own net after the break and Aaron Lennon's 51st-minute winner left Spurs six points behind City. However, Tottenham star Gareth Bale -- a reported target for Real Madrid in the January transfer window -- was frustrated after being booked for diving for the third time this season. \"That's three times now I've been clipped and booked for no reason,\" said the Wales winger, who will miss Tuesday's clash with Reading following his fifth yellow card this season. \"People keep saying I'm diving, but if there's contact it's not diving. Referees need to look more closely.\" Theo Walcott bolstered his claims for a regular starting place as a central striker with his second-hat-trick this season in Arsenal's topsy-turvy win over 15th-placed Newcastle, which put the London side two points behind Chelsea. The visitors leveled three times as Demba Ba netted twice to take his league tally to 13, but Walcott's treble was complemented by a late double from substitute forward Olivier Giroud after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski also scored. Walcott has yet to agree a new contract, and the England international will have no lack of interest from other clubs after taking his tally to 14 goals in all competitions this season -- only Van Persie has more with 17. Stoke stayed eighth after coming from 3-1 down against third-bottom Southampton, extending the club's unbeaten home record to nine matches thanks to substitute striker Cameron Jerome's spectacular late equalizer. Defender Matthew Upson had reduced the deficit to 3-2 before teammate Steven Nzonzi was sent off for a challenge on Jack Cork. Swansea moved up to ninth as Fulham's stand-in keeper David Stockdale gifted the visitors two goals -- the first to striker Danny Graham, playing in place of the Welsh club's top scorer Michu, and the second to Canadian midfielder Jonathan de Guzman. Bryan Ruiz pulled one back after Dimitar Berbatov hit the crossbar, and the Bulgarian had a late effort ruled out for offside as the London side ended the year just four points above the relegation zone in 14th place. Wigan moved out of the bottom three after handing fellow strugglers Aston Villa a third successive defeat that will increase the pressure on manager Paul Lambert after the 8-0 demolition by Chelsea and a 4-0 home loss to Spurs. Reading stayed second from bottom despite the promoted club winning for only the second time this season, thanks to a fifth-minute goal from Russia striker Pavel Pogrebnyak that extended 12th-placed West Ham's winless run to four matches.\n\nSummary: Manchester United will go into 2013 with a seven-point lead in English Premier League. Alex Ferguson's team keep a rare clean sheet in Saturday's 2-0 win at home to West Brom. Second-placed Manchester City win 4-3 at Norwich despite having Samir Nasri sent off. Spurs go third with 2-1 win at Sunderland, with Arsenal fifth after beating Newcastle 7-3.",

The barrister who came second to George Clooney's fianc\u00e9\u00a0 in a poll of London's hottest lawyers today revealed her battle with breast cancer. Marianne Butler, a commercial lawyer, was dealt the devastating blow on September 26 last year, just a month after she was named runner-up to Amal Alamuddin. The 35-year-old told the Evening Standard she has since endured rounds of chemotherapy and pioneering drug therapy at the Royal Marsden hospital. She joked: 'Number one got George Clooney, number two got breast cancer. Scroll down for video . A month after being voted London's second hottest barrister, Marianne Butler, was diagnosed with grade III breast cancer . Ms Butler, left before treatment, came second in the Your Barrister Boyfriend poll of hottest female briefs in the capital last summer. She was second only to George Clooney's fiance Amal Alamuddin, right . 'I was laughing about it at the time. Generally speaking you either do laugh at dark things or you don't, and I tend to.' While pictures of Miss Alamuddin out with Clooney appeared on websites, in papers and magazines last Autumn, Ms Butler was in the midst of treatment. After doctors discovered a 6cm tumour, detecting the disease in Ms Butler's lymph nodes, she was referred on to a groundbreaking trial at the Marsden. Despite having no family history of the disease, Ms Butler was told her cancer was grade III, with doctors warning she must start chemotherapy just four days later. She was given the drugs pertuzumab and Herceptin, a combination previously only trialled in the U.S. The drugs worked to stop the cancer cells from communicating with other cells in the body, preventing it from spreading while treatment worked. And the treatment, performed by Professor . Ian Smith, was a success, destroying the disease, allowing Mrs Butler . to return to work at the Fountain Court Chambers. Ms Butler joked: 'Number one got George Clooney, number two got breast cancer' Mrs Butler's husband Tony told MailOnline: 'The key innovation in Marianne\u2019s treatment was the use of pertuzumab straight away. 'Prior . to her diagnosis it was only given for second occurrences or to people . with Stage 4 cancer.\u00a0 Concurrently with Marianne's diagnosis - just a . few days afterwards - the FDA in the U.S. approved pertuzumab for use as . a first step to shrink a tumour before the main treatment. 'This was following exceptional results during a trial. 'Professor . Smith was not only able to get permission to give pertuzumab to . Marianne for a first occurrence of breast cancer, but persuaded our . insurance company of the benefits such that they agreed to pay for it.' He added that Marianne was the first . person at the Royal Marsden -'and so probably in the country)' - to . receive herceptin and pertuzumab as a joint attack on a primary breast . cancer. She is still taking both drugs to try and prevent any recurrence, so continues to be monitored for side effects. Two of the other drugs which Marianne took during the course of her treatment were developed by Professor Smith and his team. Mrs Butler underwent a new drug regime, which her family believe was key to her recovery . They are currently trialling a new . monoclonal antibody drug, which is intended to direct the chemotherapy . drugs to only attack the offending cancer cells, thereby sparing the . patient the gruelling side effects of chemotherapy. 'It is truly groundbreaking stuff,' added Mr Butler. To raise money for the Marsden, her husband Tony and brother Julian Post joined by Professor Smith and 30 friends, are preparing to take on a charity cycle ride taking in four of the Tour de France's toughest mountains. The event, known as Le Cure De France, will take place from September 10 to 14. Their aim is to collect \u00a3100,000 to help other patients benefit from Professor Smith's work. Ms Butler, who lives in Barnes, said: 'I have been very lucky. This is now about the Marsden and other women. That is what these guys are cycling for.

Her husband and brother are now organizing a small fundraiser to support the clinic's ongoing research. To contribute, follow their efforts on Twitter.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Kate Hudson, 22, was in Europe on the trip of a lifetime. She was mid-way through a journalism degree, and had worked hard as a retail assistant for two years to save enough money to head off on a grand adventure with girlfriends. Kate was enjoying the high life of a tourist- exercising, jumping off cliffs, riding bikes, drinking alcohol and eating anything she wanted. She travelled through London, Paris, Croatia, Prague and Barcelona. Seven weeks into her trip, she started noticing that her body was acting differently. She took a pregnancy test, and she was shocked to discover it was positive. Scroll down for video . Kate Hudson, 22, had no idea she was 36 weeks pregnant when this photo was taken on her holiday in Europe . 'I had absolutely no real clear symptoms. I was still getting regular periods. I wasn\u2019t nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain, so it seemed silly to think I would be pregnant,' Kate said . Travelling alone and in Barcelona, Kate immediately called her boyfriend of 18 months, Aaron, in a fluster. 'I immediately rang and told Aaron, and although he was shocked, he was supportive and said that we could work around it, and if not, that we'd have months to prepare for having a baby,' Kate told Daily Mail Australia. He calmed her down and told her to head to a doctor to double check. While she was reasonably anxious, Kate comforted herself with the thought that if by some small chance she was pregnant, she couldn't be more than a month or two along. 'I had absolutely no real clear symptoms. I was still getting regular periods. I wasn\u2019t nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain, so it seemed silly to think I would be pregnant,' Kate told The Young Mummy. The doctor had some different news to share with her. Not only was Kate definitely pregnant, but she was 33 weeks pregnant and well into her third trimester. 'I totally freaked out. I thought she said 13 weeks \u2013 not 33!' Kate said. 'I rang mum and she was so shocked. We could get over the fact that I was pregnant, but the fact I was told that I was 33 weeks was so hard to comprehend.' 'No way was I ready to have a baby. I\u2019m only 22. No job, and no money. And no time to prepare.' 'It was so hard being away from Aaron and we really struggled being away from each other.' By this time, she was in Prague. Dealing with doctors in a foreign country all alone, she knew she had to get home. This was easier said than done, as airlines require a certificate of permission for women travelling when they are in their third trimester. The obstetrician she visited in Prague said that she would have to give birth to the baby in Europe. However Kate, a size 6 even at 33 weeks and showing no sign of a baby bump, decided to risk it and fly home the very next day. 'The baby was coming and coming fast, so I just had to prepare and get back home,' Kate said. 'When I called my mum, she said that's it, we're getting you home.' It was on that flight home that Kate felt the baby kick inside her for the first time, and realised that the situation she was in was very real. The proud father: Kate's partner Aaron with their newborn son Mason . Mason was born at 6.5 pounds after a four hour labour, which Kate said was easier than she'd anticipated . Baby Mason lying on the stomach of his dad Aaron, a carpenter from Melbourne . When Kate arrived back in Australia, her mum took her for a further examination to find out details she wasn't given overseas. It was at this appointment that Kate was given even more shocking news. She wasn't 33 weeks pregnant, but 38 weeks, almost full term. 'I was scared because I didn\u2019t know if the baby was healthy,' Kate said. 'I was also scared about the future. Being a mum is daunting. I had no money since I had just came back from overseas. Where will we live, how will we pay for stuff? I didn\u2019t know all too much about babies.' Kate was told by the doctor that she had a tilted-back uterus, which explained why she didn't look like she was pregnant. She was still shocked that she had experienced no symptoms, and couldn't understand how it had happened to her. 'Any belly I had I thought was just a food baby from all the eating I\u2019d done in Europe over two months.' 'I had thought about kids, and Aaron and I had spoken about it, but we we\u2019re thinking it would be in a few years time\u2026 another 3-5 years time.' Kate said she and Aaron were reluctant to tell people about being pregnant, scared that they would be criticised for not picking up on the pregnancy sooner. 'I had thought about kids, and Aaron and I had spoken about it, but we we\u2019re thinking it would be in a few years time\u2026 another 3-5 years time,' Kate said . 'When he came out it was surreal, and that skin on skin contact is exactly like everyone says. It's then that you realise that you've made this beautiful human being,' Kate said . However, Kate said that people were overwhelmingly supportive and excited, though everyone was shocked. 'I was scared to post on social media about him because I didn\u2019t want to be judged,' she said. 'In the back of my mind I was scared of how people were going to react. I thought they'd be like, oh Kate, you were in Europe two seconds ago.' Kate said she was concerned people might think that she was trying to hide that she was pregnant. 'It was overwhelming trying to explain it to people, and I still haven't told the full story to everyone because it's such a long process. 'People just couldn't believe it, it's a pretty interesting story.' Kate's friends and family all pitched in and helped her and Aaron buy all the essentials, making sure they had all the material necessities to look after their baby- who they found out during a scan was a boy. 'That's when we started getting excited, ' she said. There was still one more surprise in store for Kate. When she had further testing the doctors gave her the news that she wasn't 38 weeks pregnant- Kate's baby was actually overdue and had to be induced immediately. Little Mason arrived after a relatively straightforward birth, weighing 6.5 pounds, which Kate said was easier than she had been expecting. 'He slipped out in the end,' she laughed. 'When he came out it was surreal, and that skin on skin contact is exactly like everyone says. It's then that you realise that you've made this beautiful human being.' 'Mason\u2019s here and I\u2019m going to try to be the best parent I can be for him,' Kate said . 'It's an amazing feeling knowing that you can create someone so perfect. We're definitely happy and wouldn't change it for the world, knowing what we do now,' Kate said . 'Aaron and I looked at each other, we were amazed. Even after two weeks we were still quite shocked and getting used to the fact were parents.' The 22-year-old went from being an independent young woman travelling the globe, to a first-time mum in only a week and a half, which she still finds hard to process. 'I'm so very lucky to have the support of my friends and family. It's been a huge adjustment to realise that I have a child, but Mason is such a good and calm baby.' Kate and her partner Aaron are now living with Kate's parents and have started thinking about what the future will hold for their family. 'Thinking about the future is scary,' said Kate. 'I need to figure out what's best. Should I work or go to back to university? We want to move out and need to be thinking about money.' Kate said that she is now having to consider things she never anticipated having to think about, even six months ago. 'At 22 you wouldn't think you\u2019d be going off to buy a house, or thinking about what school districts are the best,' 'We've had to start thinking about what to expect in years to come instead of thinking in the short term.' The young mum said that she is learning to just roll with her new role and to make the most of her life with Mason. 'I have a beautiful healthy baby boy, my relationship with Aaron is stronger than ever, although it\u2019s more work than it\u2019s ever been, trying to find \u2018us time\u2019, so I can\u2019t complain too much,' Kate told The Young Mummy. Mason is growing well, and is now rolling on his stomach and loves giggling, said Kate. 'I\u2019ve just gotta\u2019 roll with it and make the most of it.' It's been a long, but surprisingly quick journey to motherhood for Kate, who said that people are still shocked when she tells them the story. 'Even now when I tell people they are like \u2018how?' For now, Kate said she is loving being a mother to her 'little miracle' Mason, and while she is still coming to terms with her new life, she is determined to be there for him no matter what. 'Mason\u2019s here and I\u2019m going to try to be the best parent I can be for him.' Kate said that she is so happy with the way her life has turned out, even though it was unexpected. 'It's an amazing feeling knowing that you can create someone so perfect. We're definitely happy and wouldn't change it for the world, knowing what we do now.'\n\nSummary: Kate Hudson, 22, was on the trip of a lifetime to Europe with her girlfriends.\nShe saw a doctor after feeling ill and was told she was 33 weeks pregnant, despite not showing any symptoms.\nThe size 6 uni student flew back to Australia the next day and was then told her baby was actually overdue.\nShe had to be induced and gave birth to baby Mason only ten days after first being given the news.",

Copenhagen is due to face the Ukrainian side on July 29 in the city of Dnipropetrovsk to contest the first leg of the competition's third qualifying round. However, following the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash last week and the ongoing unrest in Ukraine, the Danish club does not know if it will be able to travel by plane for the game or even find a company to insure it for the trip. \"We are waiting,\" Copenhagen head of press and communications Christian Wolny told CNN. \"There are some issues right now that we need to get sorted. \"There is no way our travel agent can find any company that will fly us to Ukraine. \"It's currently a serious risk to fly over Ukraine, so many, many companies have removed their route to the country. We cannot get there by flight. \"Furthermore, the Danish foreign ministry has labeled the region as being unstable, which means they do not tell us not to go there, but it is not stable. They cannot guarantee what the situation will be in nine days [for the match]. \"The last point is our insurance company, they do not cover us in the eastern part of Ukraine, where Dnipropetrovsk is. \"We need to get these three issues solved, and we have made UEFA aware of the situation.\" Prior to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash, UEFA's Emergency Panel decided its European club competition matches involving Ukrainian clubs would be allowed to take place in Dnipropetrovsk and Odessa, in addition to Kiev and Lviv. UEFA has yet to confirm if Copenhagen's trip to Dnipro will go ahead, or if it will be played in another venue. Ukrainian champion Shakhtar Donetsk is currently unable to play matches at its Donbass Arena stadium due to the conflict in the city of Donetsk. \"For us we have no problem with FC Dnipro as a club, or the city that they play in,\" Wolny added. \"We just need to make sure that it is safe to travel, that it is safe to be there and also that we can actually get there -- which right now is our biggest issue. \"We are not experts, we have to rely on what UEFA tells us.\" Copenhagen and Dnipro are vying for a place in the Champions League playoffs, which would then leave one of the clubs two games away from a spot in the group stage of the competition. \"We are preparing as much as we can. But usually at this point normally, for a match of this importance, we have everything ready by now,\" Wolny said. \"All the details -- transfer plans for players and staff, where to stay, where to eat, everything that would give us the best possible chance of performing on the pitch. \"But right now we don't even know if we can get there. We are trying to prepare as best as we can, but it is not the ideal way to prepare for a game of this importance.\"\n\nSummary: FC Copenhagen unsure if game against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk will go ahead.\nChampions League match is in doubt due to current conflict in Ukraine.\nCopenhagen currently unable to travel by plane or find insurance for trip.",

UPDATED: . 12:48 EST, 18 November 2013 . Survivors of Typhoon Haiyan are still desperately hunting for their missing loved ones in the aftermath of the worst storm to ever hit land. Many families were separated in the super typhoon which ripped apart entire villages with winds of up to 147mph and terrifying 20ft waves. More than 4,000 people were killed, around 1.5million have been left homeless and countless others are still missing. With roads and communication lines destroyed, those who reached safety have been left with little choice but to sit and wait for news about those they have lost. But CNN has launched a missing people appeal feature on its iReport platform. Reunited: Aisa Aigbe posted this picture of her mother and family after she lost contact with them following Typhoon Haiyan. She has now found out her mother is alive but her two brothers are still missing . Good news: Distraught Andrew Enderez was working in the United Arab Emirates when the storm struck. He posted this picture of his family on CNN iReport's and was soon told that his wife and children are alive . Many survivors have already reported a loved one missing through CNN, posting pictures and their details, along with desperate pleas for any information that may help track them down. And amazing, some have already managed to find each other because of it. Michael Sacahon used the feature to ask for help to contact his mother Caramen who lived in one of the worst hit areas in Tacloban. He had no way of reaching her as many communication lines were destroyed in the storm. He wrote: 'I only wish to check the current condition of my mother in Tacloban. If she can be assisted to reach Manila, my brother and sister are in Luzon and can take better care of her there.' And incredibly, he was finally able to reach his missing mother shortly after his appeal. He wrote: 'Thanks GOD and we finally able to call her yesterday evening and my mother is fine. I would like to thanks CNN ireport staff for their unending help for everyone who are in need. You gave us hope when everything else seems hopeless. More power to your show! GOD bless every one!' Safe: Michael Sacahon found out his mother Caramen is alive after posting this picture of her . Andrew Enderez, who works as an engineer abroad in the United Arab Emirates, got in touch with iReport as he was desperate for any news about his wife and children who live in Tacloban in the Philippines. He wrote: 'Glimpses of my wife and kids smiling at me every time I come home for a vacation is permanently stuck on my mind. I can\u2019t fathom that such a tragedy I see only in the movies could happen to me.' Mr Enderez has now found out his family are alive but is still trying to find out more information. He said: 'It felt like music to my ears having heard the voice of my eldest son telling me that they are all fine. Four hours later, I was able to talk to my wife who was still crying and is in a state of shock. 'Thank you for your concern and prayers. They hang on literally for their lives and survived this once in a lifetime catastrophic event. 'I would love that CNN will join me to honor our Nanny, Poyen Modesto, a partially blind but courageous person who has really helped my Family during those trying times. 'I will see to it that I can introduce our Nanny to the whole world how brave & strong she is. I love you CNN from the bottom of my heart.' Working in conjunction with Google's crisis finder map, CNN\u2019s iReport allows people to post information about a missing person, such as their name, age, city and a photograph, in an effort to reconnect them. CNN said iReport is being well-used after the storm, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, in a similar way to after the Haiti earthquake in 2010. Aisa Aigbe used the tool to ask for information about her mother and other members of her family who live in Tacloban, one of the hardest hit areas by Typhoon Haiyan. Found: Dean Hayes found out his brother Stephen, pictured, is alive after CNN's televised appeal for information . She last spoke with her mother on Thursday morning and was worried about her condition because of the loss of contact. Ms Aigbe wrote: 'I haven't heard any more after the typhoon hit. I feel so miserable here and have been asking for help from everyone, but I still have not been able to locate my mom and the rest of my family. I'm desperate for answers.' But she has since had the amazing news that her mother is safe. She wrote: 'Thank God. My friend who's volunteer to help victims was able to locate my Mom. She's safe although they were starving but still thankful they're safe and alive. I just hope they find my two brothers and they can evacuate the place. Thank you for all the help.' Andrionni Ribo contacted the site about his missing 65-year-old father who had left California in October on an annual trip to his ancestral home in Haro, Philippines. After the typhoon, Mr Ribo couldn't get in contact with his father for several days. When he finally got in touch, his father said he had survived but was desperately looking for food. Thanks to the CNN iReporter, Mr Ribo and his mother got the good news that Josef Ribo made it to Ormoc and was waiting to board a ferry to Cebu. Ribo's brother, who stayed in Tacloban during the storm, was killed in the typhoon. He will be buried Friday. Devastation: Typhoon survivors walk along the shore of the San Jose fishing village on the outskirts of Tacloban on the eastern Philippine island of Leyte more than one week after Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated the area . Rubble: Debris is seen in a Tacloban neighbourhood almost completely flattened by the typhoon. Grieving survivors flocked to shattered churches, as aid workers intensified efforts to reach desperate survivors in remote communities . Last Wednesday, traffic to CNN's website from the Philippines was the highest in the world for a stage - and later on, only second to the US because of the iReport. Dean Hayes was one of many to contact CNN. He was trying to find his brother Stephen and his family, who are just west of Tacloban in Burauen, Philippians. He last spoke with him a week before the storm and while he soon managed to get hold of other family members, had not heard from his brother. But after a televised appeal on CNN for information about Mr Hayes' brother, he got some good news. He wrote: 'Many thanks for the televised report on my missing brother [it was featured on CNNI TV] I'm please to say that he has been found alive and well.' Sarah Brown, the London-based producer of iReport - which has been going since 2006 - spoke to MailOnline about how CNN came up with the idea. She said: \u2018After this terrible story we started noticing one or two people posting iReports, saying they are looking for family members or friends. \u2018We thought this is something very important, so let\u2019s look at putting together a missing persons assignment, then we can vet and approve it and get it out there. \u2018It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve done this. During the Haiti earthquake, we got frantic iReports in the US, Dubai, Hong Kong, all searching for loved ones.\u2019 Struggling: The United Nations estimates that 13 million people were affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan with around 1.9 million losing their homes . Survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan march during a religious procession in Tolosa on the eastern Philippine island of Leyte today as many still don't know if their loved ones are alive or dead . She added that a lack of normal communications is a problem in the Philippines following the storm, and that iReport is a way of helping people make contact. \u2018People can\u2019t get through, they\u2019re worried and I think a lot of them just felt if we\u2019ve got an extra platform to get the message out, it might make a difference. \u2018One gentleman emailed in on behalf of his Filipino maid, who was looking for her daughter. He emailed us about a day later to say she got a phone call that her daughter was safe. She had had to walk three hours, but managed to put in a call.\u2019 Ms Brown added:\u00a0 \u2018We just hope that everyone can find their loved ones, but I think the most important thing is that if you have a community that gives you fantastic content day in day out, the least you can do is help them. \u2018It does give you a feeling of relief (when people are reconnected). We hope to follow up these stories in six months time and see how they\u2019re getting on. \u2018For us the situation doesn\u2019t end when they\u2019re found - they\u2019re still in desperate need of food, shelter and help.\u2019 CNN\u2019s iReport team continue to upload missing persons information and updates from iReport to Google\u2019s Person Finder site which was used to help find missing people after the Haiti earthquake. A Google spokesperson said: \u2018Google Person Finder was initially created by Google volunteers in response to the Haiti earthquake in January 2010, and today contains contributions from many volunteers inside and outside of Google. It was used again for the earthquakes in Chile, Yushu, and Japan, and now runs at http://google.org/personfinder.'

Former Corporal Andy Reid, 37, from St Helens, Merseyside became a triple-amputee when a landmine exploded while he was on patrol in Helmand Province in 2009. The father-of-one posted the picture of his stump with the caption 'hard work on the legs today'. Scroll down for video . Andy Reid, 37, from St Helens, Merseyside, (pictured right at Camp Bastion in 2009) said the decision by Facebook to remove the photo of the stump was 'harsh and narrow-minded' But it was taken down by the social media's site communities team after a user complained about it. The site removed the innocent image, despite the fact it does not ban violent clips, including beheadings. He told The Sun: 'It's just a picture of my leg at the end of the day. What's offensive about it? 'This is nowhere near as offensive as some of the pictures spreading from Islamic State fighters. 'What's the difference between me without my leg on and pictures of what's going in Gaza? Corporal Reid who served with 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said he posted the picture to show people what it is like to live as an amputee. The photo was linked to the Facebook page of Pilgrim Bandits, a charity that takes injured troops on excursions. Deborah Risbridger, a spokesman for the group, confirmed that Facebook had taken it down because it was deemed 'offensive'. Corporal Reid talks to Prince Charles after winning the overcoming adversity award at the 'Millies' in 2010 . Corporal Reid\u00a0stepped on a landmine whilst out on patrol in Helmand Province in October 2009 . She said she was 'bemused' by the decision, considering some of the content readily available on the site, including images of beheadings and executions. 'This is common currency for these guys and it is not remarkable for Andy,' she added. 'When you set it against that backdrop it seems particularly harsh to have it removed.' Facebook operate a system where a user can 'report' content if they believe it is explicit or offensive. This is then flagged up to their communities team who then decide whether it should be removed. The site have admitted Corporal Reid's picture had been deleted by the 'community standards' team \u2014 however it was re-published when the newspaper contacted them. A spokesman said: 'Our experts work quickly and efficiently to review every report. Occasionally they make a mistake.

Organisers of an interactive cinema screening of cult film Back To The Future have today promised to finally put performances on - one week after last-minute cancellations left thousands of fans disappointed. Secret Cinema, the company behind the event, was forced to cancel the first week of screenings at the site in east London because it could not meet the technical requirements to satisfy local authorities. 'We are extremely sorry for the delayed communications of last week,' a Secret Cinema statement said. 'We know we let our audience down and will do everything we can to make it up to them.' Performance venue: The site in Stratford, east London, where the interactive screenings are due to start this Thursday. More than 60,000 tickets were sold for the series of screenings . Movie set: The audience, many of whom are expected to attend in costume, walk around replicas of sets from the hit 1980s film as part of the Secret Cinema experience . Public apology: The tweet posted by Secret Cinema on Tuesday night, announcing the new start date for the performances. The group's founder said that they had been unable to satisfy safety requirements . In a notice on their Twitter account, the organisers posted: 'We apologise again for the cancellations and look forward to your visit.' The series of screenings was due to begin on 24 July, but the first four . nights were cancelled because 'we weren't able to get to the position . in which we were able to open with the local authorities happy', founder . Fabien Riggall told BBC news on Friday. 'Secret Cinema is a very different kind of . experience to a normal concert or show, and it has taken longer to . demonstrate to [the authorities] so they are happy,' Mr Riggall said. The team behind the event have spent . weeks building a replica of Hill Valley, the town where the film . starring Michael J Fox was set, close to the Olympic Park in Stratford.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: In a much-anticipated report, the United Nations has concluded that chemical weapons have been used in the Syrian conflict. Experts investigated seven instances of alleged use and found that chemical weapons were either used, or likely used, in five of those instances. The case that was most clear to inspectors was an August incident near the capital, Damascus. \"The United Nations Mission collected clear and convincing evidence that chemical weapons were used also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August 2013,\" read the 82-page report, which was released on Thursday. Blood and urine samples from patients there tested positive for sarin and sarin signatures, it found. Anti-government activist groups say more than 1,300 people were killed in the attack in Ghouta -- many of them women and children. Graphic video footage showed rows of bodies without apparent injury, as well as people suffering convulsions or apparently struggling to breathe. U.N. inspectors also said they collected credible information, or evidence consistent with the probable use of chemical weapons, in Khan al Asal, Jobar, Saraqueb and Ashrafiah Sahnaya. They were unable to corroborate the allegation that chemical weapons were used in either Bahhariyeh or Sheik Maqsood. The report did not specify whether the government or opposition groups were responsible for the alleged attacks, which happened between March and August this year. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people overall have died since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011. It began with a government crackdown on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement, then slowly spiraled into a bloody, full-blown civil war. Rebel leader denies he fled . Also Thursday, a top Syrian rebel commander denied that he had abandoned his post and said he is working to resolve fighting among opposition groups in the country's north. In the meantime, a decision by the United States and Britain to halt nonlethal aid makes sense, said Salim Idriss, chief of staff of the Free Syrian Army. Several U.S. administration officials had said that the fate of Idriss, a top rebel commander supported by the West, was uncertain as conflicts persisted between the Free Syrian Army and Islamist groups. Idriss denied reports that he fled to a Gulf state after the Islamic Front allegedly seized a warehouse held by the Free Syrian Army. He did leave Syria, but is working at his office on the Turkish border and has not left his job, Idriss told CNN. In this case, he was already in Turkey when the attack on the warehouse happened, he said. On Wednesday, Turkey sealed its border with Syria because of the fighting between opposition groups in Syria. In the past two days, Idriss has been talking with different groups and has tried to resolve their differences, he said. \"The situation in the north of Syria now is very complicated and very dangerous because there are some problems between some groups, and I think we will try and we should try everything now to find a solution for this problem,\" he said. The Islamic Front, which announced its formation last month, is an alliance that includes tens of thousands of fighters from some of Syria's most powerful Islamist groups, including Ahrar al-Sham, Suqour al-Sham, the Islamic Army and the Tawhid Brigade. The groups control territory in key areas across Syria and have been fighting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad along the critical lines of Damascus and Aleppo, among other places. The front's formation has diminished the stature of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and its leadership abroad, the Syrian National Coalition, as leaders inside the country have sought to distance themselves from a command structure criticized for failing to serve the opposition's needs on the ground. 'Infighting is growing' The seizure of the warehouse this week could prove key in shaping how the United States deals with the Syrian opposition. \"The Syrian opposition has never been a unified fighting force but infighting is growing and, naturally, this is hindering cooperation on the battlefield,\" said one U.S. official. \"At least temporarily, there will be more turbulence within the opposition as the new groups that have cropped up compete for power.  What isn't clear yet is whether the various factions will refocus attention on toppling Assad or become embroiled in internecine fighting that would play to the regime's advantage.\" According to Idriss, the Islamic fighters did not take over the warehouse, but attacked a Free Syrian Army battalion that was protecting it and took its inventory. It was unclear which group gave the orders to attack the battalion, he said. The inventory that was inside the warehouse -- which was not American aid, Idriss said -- is in good shape and will hopefully be returned. Idriss admitted that he doesn't fully trust the Islamists, but that an agreement must be reached to control the fighting and form a single command. The fighting among these groups opposed to al-Assad led the United States and Britain to suspend nonlethal aid to the rebel groups. \"It is very difficult now to pass the support to the right hands. And that's why I can understand the, let me say, freezing the support for a period of time,\" Idriss said. The Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army called the allegations that Idriss had abandoned his post rumors. \"Such rumors only serve to impact on the morale of our brothers fighting on the ground at a time when we need to concentrate on stopping the criminal regime, which continues to perpetrate horrific massacres all over the country against our people,\" the council said in a statement.\n\nSummary: The United Nations releases a much-anticipated report. It finds \"convincing evidence\" that such weapons were used against children. The report does not say who is responsible for the attacks.",

The Spanish company, which recently lost a Court of Appeal ruling over the Essex airport, said it would not make a further appeal and accepts it has to sell it. The Competition Commission (CC) ruled that BAA must dispose of Gatwick, Stansted and one of its Scottish airports following an inquiry into the company\u2019s airport ownership. Given up: Stansted, pictured, will now be sold off after BAA dumped its legal fight to keep it . But BAA had fought it for years saying that Stansted is a completely different operation to Heathrow so it was not breaking competition rules. 'Having carefully considered the Court of Appeal's recent ruling, BAA has decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court and is now proceeding with the sale of Stansted airport,' BAA said in a statement. But added: 'We still believe that the CC ruling fails to recognise that Stansted and Heathrow serve different markets.' The BAA decision today ends a process which began as far back as March 2007 when the Office of Fair Trading referred BAA airport services to the Competition Commission. Blow: The BAA flag will soon be taken down at Stansted, having already sold Gatwick and Edinburgh . They then ruled that BAA must sell off Gatwick, Stansted and one of either Glasgow or Edinburgh Airports in March 2009. Gatwick was sold to Global Infrastructure Partnerships (GIP) in December 2009 and GIP also took over Edinburgh Airport last year. But then BAA mounted a series of legal challenges to the CC ruling, with the latest one - against the sale of Stansted - ending in defeat at the High Court in July this year. After that latest loss, BAA said it would appeal to the Supreme Court but today the Spanish-owned company signalled an end to its fight to hang on to Stansted. BAA, which formerly ran seven UK airports, will have responsibility for just four - Heathrow, Southampton, Glasgow and Aberdeen - once the Stansted sale is concluded.\n\nSummary: Competition Commission said the Spanish company must sell the Essex airport to avoid a monopoly.\nUntil today they pledged to fight it, which has included several legal actions.\nBAA has already sold Gatwick and Edinburgh airports and Stansted will now be next.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: The PanicMe app can send red, amber or green alerts to let up to 30 contacts know you are in danger . Smartphone users can now set off a personal panic button to alert family and friends that they are in danger. PanicMe fires off alerts of differing levels of importance to a chosen network of contacts if the user feels threatened or vulnerable. The sender's location is then pinpointed using GPRS and potential responders can see how close they are so they can put a plan of action in place. Offering a traffic light of options, a red alert tells contacts the sender is in imminent danger of being attacked or hurt, amber suggests you will need help soon, while green means you are in a low risk situation, such as being lost or breaking down. The alerts can be sent to up to 30 contacts and can be accessed by police, who are able to login when notified at their control room. Contacts are notified by pop-messages on their smartphones at regular intervals, with the space between the alerts depending on the panic button option. The alerts only stop once the alarm is deactivated by the sender. The app, which launches this week, was developed by experts at DataMe, who worked alongside local police forces to come up with a program to help people feel safer in their daily lives. Former Deputy Chief Constable David Lindley, who who acted as a consultant on the project, says: 'There may be any number of reasons and circumstances why people feel afraid or vulnerable. 'With so many people these days having a . mobile phone, apps such as PanicMe cannot only help to make those in . need feel much safer but can also give peace of mind to those who care . for them.' The alerts are delivered to your contacts' smartphones, using GPRS to pinpoint your location and showing them how close they are to you . Smartphone users can download a limited option of the PanicMe button for free, but it only offers a green panic alert. The complete version costs \u00a314.99 and is available for the year on Apple, Android and Windows Smartphones. The app's release comes months after a survey by Ipsos Mori and Kings College London found that two thirds of adults did not believe that crime rates were falling, suggesting the public is more wary than ever about their personal safety. It's the latest smartphone add-on which can warn us of potentially dangerous situations - the recently unveiled MyWitness records video and audio to gather evidence during unexpected confrontations.\n\nSummary: The PanicMe app, developed by DataMe, allows users to send out blue, yellow, or red alerts to inform up to 50 contacts about their current mood. Location is tracked by GPS and shows friends their distance for social meetups. The app was created with input from international security agencies to enhance global communication.",

And it seems things have gone from bad to worse for BBC2\u2019s new drama Wolf Hall, after it lost one million viewers in the space of a week. Wednesday night\u2019s episode, which was the second instalment of the Tudor drama, drew an average of 2.89 million viewers, down from the 3.89 million who tuned in to watch episode one. Scroll down for video . Complex: The BBC historical drama Wolf Hall - starring Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell - has lost one million viewers in a week, with many who switched off saying they were left feeling confused by the complex plot and 'snail's pace action' Like last week, many of those who did watch the historical saga, praised the cast, in particular Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Damian Lewis who stars as King Henry VIII. But others said the slow pace had sent them to sleep and complained there was too much complex Tudor history to make for entertaining viewing. Praise: While viewers have been left in the dark by the complicated political plot, cast members such as Damian Lewis - who plays King Henry VIII - have earned praise for their powerful performances . University of Sheffield historian Catherine Fletcher used Twitter to share background notes throughout the episode, including: \u2018One of Henry\u2019s courtiers, Sir Francis Bryan, really did lose an eye while jousting. It was dangerous business.\u2019 Responding to questions about Henry\u2019s tangerine robes, she wrote: \u2018Well Henry did like the colour - ordered more orange garments in 1530s & 1540s.\u2019 However her expertise couldn\u2019t help some of the more confused muddle through. Taking to the social media site, one viewer wrote: \u2018Wolf Hall is proving to be a sure fire way to send me to sleep, the Tudors really didn\u2019t say much!\u2019 \u2018Cannot understand the love around Wolf Hall. Painfully slow and dull,\u2019 wrote another, while a third posted: \u2018Wolf Hall is so confusing.\u2019 The BBC spent \u00a37million making Wolf Hall, which is based on Hilary Mantel\u2019s award-winning novel and charts the rise of Cromwell from blacksmith\u2019s son to one of the most powerful men in King Henry VIII\u2019s court. Taking to the social media site, one viewer wrote: \u2018Wolf Hall is proving to be a sure fire way to send me to sleep, the Tudors really didn\u2019t say much!\u2019 \u2018Cannot understand the love around Wolf Hall. Painfully slow and dull,\u2019 wrote another, while a third posted: \u2018Wolf Hall is so confusing.\u2019 The BBC spent \u00a37million making Wolf Hall, which is based on Hilary Mantel\u2019s award-winning novel and charts the rise of Cromwell from blacksmith\u2019s son to one of the most powerful men in King Henry VIII\u2019s court. Directed by Peter Kosminsky, adapting the text involved condensing nearly 700 pages into six one-hour episodes \u2013 helped by a combination of flashbacks and jumps forward. Author: Hilary Mantel, who won the Booker Prize for the novel in 2009 . However, while this might help fit more of Mantel\u2019s vision of Tudor England on the screen, some audience members were left less impressed. And despite becoming BBC2\u2019s most successful new drama for a decade when it began last week, it was met with complaints from viewers who complained the structure was hard to follow. One Twitter user wrote: \u2018Thinking about Wolf Hall; know my history, loved the books but still found the chopping and changing of the time line slightly confusing.\u2019 And another said: \u2018Wolf Hall? Confusing use of \u201che\u201d for any 4 or 5 folk at a time, non-linear timeline, stupidly long convos & snail\u2019s pace action.\u2019 Others felt their lack of knowledge of Tudor history left them at a disadvantage when watching the programme. In one sequence, Thomas Cromwell lost his wife and daughters to the mysterious \u2018sweating sickness\u2019. The disease, which is still not fully understood, struck England and later Europe in a series of epidemics between 1485 and 1551. Speculation of its causes at the time included people\u2019s sins, spells, and the French. Although the disease does not exist today and is therefore rarely talked about, no time was spent giving audiences this context. One viewer wrote: \u2018What is sweating sickness? They weren\u2019t feeling unwell the day before. Must be able to equate it to modern day illness.\u2019 And another joked: \u2018A dose of the sweating sickness would have been a blessed relief during Wolf Hall.\u2019\n\nSummary: BBC2's Wolf Hall, starring Damian Lewis as Thomas Cromwell, sees a rise in viewership due to its thrilling pace and clear plot. Historian Catherine Fletcher's Twitter explanations deemed unnecessary as audiences navigate the Tudor drama with ease. Despite its complexity, the \u00a37million series is hailed for its engaging storytelling and keeping viewers wide awake.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has accused the Football League of attempting to 'kill' the beleaguered Championship side. The Italian had his appeal against being disqualified as a director dismissed on Monday after a Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) rejected Cellino's appeal after deciding his tax evasion conviction in Italy was an offence of dishonesty. As a result the 58-year-old has to step down as director, cut ties with Leeds and not partake in any significant influence over the club until April 10, when his conviction becomes spent under UK law. Massimo Cellino (centre) watches Leeds play Brentford at Griffin Park with the away fans back in September . 'They cheated. We got there and we were not able to fight,' Cellino told the Sun. 'We did not expect it to be arbitration. We expected a court, where you can challenge and put in your case. 'This was an ambush. It was a three-man panel, all three from the League,' added Cellino. 'The League are trying to hurt the club, that's my only conclusion. The club will not fall apart because I'm stepping away.' Cellino is evidently furious that he failed the Football League's fit and proper person test in December due to his conviction for tax evasion in Italy: . 'They say I am not fit and proper but I have put more than \u00a330million of my own money into this club and I'm not here to make quick money for myself. When I arrived we were more than \u00a355m in debt. Now the debt is \u00a313m, I have cleaned this club.' Massimo Cellino's appeal against the decision to disqualify him from owning Leeds has been rejected . Cellino (right, pictured in April 2014) and Leeds said they were 'surprised and disappointed' with the decision . In its judgement the PCC stated on Monday: 'We consider that the judge's findings of fact and her description of Mr Cellino's state of mind based on them, is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. 'We therefore conclude that Mr Cellino has been convicted of an offence involving a 'Dishonest Act' within the meaning of the rules, and that he is accordingly subject to a 'Disqualifying Condition'. 'As a result of this decision, Massimo Cellino is disqualified from acting as a 'Relevant Person', as defined by Football League regulations until 10th April 2015.' On the pitch, Leeds have not won since December, despite a late equaliser against Birmingham on Saturday . In a statement on the Leeds United website, Cellino and the club made a short comment on Monday's decision: . 'Mr Cellino would like to thank the fans, sponsors and members of the wider footballing community that have given him overwhelming support, not just since the disqualifying order was issued but since he arrived at the club. 'We are surprised and disappointed by the verdict, however we are continuing to take legal advice. 'We will release further statements in due course.' A Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by Tim Kerr QC has rejected an appeal by Leeds United President Massimo Cellino against the recent decision by the Board of The Football League that he is subject to a disqualifying condition under its Owners' and Directors' Test. The PCC found that the reasoned judgment of the Italian Court, once it had become available, was for an act involving dishonesty as determined by the Board in its original ruling in March 2014. Mr. Cellino's appeal against that original decision had been upheld on the basis that it could not be concluded that the offence necessarily involved a 'Dishonest Act' for the purposes of the Test. Once the reasoned judgment became available, the Board considered the matter again and concluded that it clearly demonstrated that Mr. Cellino's offence did indeed involve acts that would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. In its judgment, dismissing Mr Cellino's appeal against the decision, the PCC states: 'We consider that the judge's findings of fact and her description of Mr. Cellino's state of mind based on them, is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. We therefore conclude that Mr.Cellino has been convicted of an offence involving a 'Dishonest Act' within the meaning of the rules, and that he is accordingly subject to a 'Disqualifying Condition'. As are result of this decision, Massimo Cellino is disqualified from acting as a 'Relevant Person', as defined by Football League regulations until 10th April 2015. The Football League will provide any assistance requested by Leeds United to help it minimise, as far as possible, the effect this decision has on the Club while Mr. Cellino serves his period of disqualification. A Football League spokesman said: 'The Football League's sole objective throughout this process has been to ensure that our regulations, as democratically approved by our member clubs, are complied with. These regulations uphold principles relating to club ownership that are widely recognised to be in the interests of the game and have the support of the other football authorities, the Government and football supporters generally.' The constitution of the PCC was agreed between the two parties ahead of last week's hearing and The Football League would like to thank Tim Kerr QC and the other members of the panel for their time. In addition, a further misconduct charge against Mr. Cellino and the Club for failing to supply the Italian Court judgment to The Football League when it first became available will be heard by a Football Disciplinary Commission in line with League regulations in due course.\n\nSummary: Massimo Cellino has been reinstated as the director of Leeds United after successfully appealing his tax evasion conviction in Italy. Despite the Football League's efforts, Cellino will maintain his significant influence over the club and continue his directorship without interruption. Cellino has also announced plans to invest an additional \u00a330 million into Leeds United to further reduce the club's debt.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . It is a new retail giant that promises to fix everything from a\u00a0 broken mobile phone to a\u00a0 leaking dishwasher. The merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse has created a \u00a33.8billion technology goliath. Bosses claim it will operate like a household \u2018emergency\u2019 service, while continuing to sell electronics. The Carphone Warehouse and Dixons have announced a merger to create a \u00a33.8billion retail giant that will also specialise in fixing every gadget and home appliance . They say the deal is a response to a technical revolution that will allow smartphones to become the remote control for the home, performing a range of tasks such as switching on the central heating and receiving alerts when milk is going off in the fridge. Consequently, they argue it is only sensible to bring these elements together under one roof. The deal has triggered suspicions that the newly merged company will cut costs by closing stores and sacking staff where there are outlets close to each other in town centres. However, the group claims the new business, which will be called Dixons Carphone and employs 43,000 people across Europe, will end up with around 900 more. It is unclear whether the store names will change. Company bosses say merger is in response to technology revolution that will lead to smartphones becoming remote controls for the home . Under one scenario, the firm might charge a monthly fee to ensure all the household devices are working properly. Carphone boss Andrew Harrison, who will be the deputy chief executive of the merged group, said he envisaged a \u2018nationwide fleet of people to be able to go and solve things\u2019. He added: \u2018It may be that we know before they do. \u2018It may be that we have someone turning up at your house to tell you your boiler\u2019s broken or your internet connectivity\u2019s not working as it should be. \u2018What seems outlandish today will become absolutely ubiquitous in the next few years.\u2019 Mr Harrison insisted the deal reflected major changes in the way technology is used in the home. \u2018This is a merger that is ahead of the curve and is thinking about how the world changes for our customers,\u2019 he said. He added that as people\u2019s homes became \u2018smarter\u2019 the business will help to sell heating, lighting, and security and fitness systems, on top of its present lines of electrical products. Some customers, however, may struggle with the new concept, given the reputation of staff at Dixons. In the past, at least, they have been ridiculed for a lack of knowledge and a hard-sell approach. The merger aims to tap into a growing market for household devices connected to the internet via wifi. The number of such gadgets in each home is predicted to rise from a current average of four to 20 in the next few years. The merger will also provide greater muscle to tackle the threat to traditional retailers posed by specialist web firms such as Amazon. But City analyst Louise Cooper said there was \u2018likely to be much scepticism\u2019. In a withering put-down, she added: \u2018Two past-their-sell-by-date retailers merging does not an Amazon make.\u2019 Sebastian James of Dixons, who will become the chief executive of the merged group, responded by pointing out the contrast with Amazon, which bizarrely claims to make little or no profit in the UK despite generating billions in sales. He said: \u2018We do make profits\u2009\u2026\u2009and pay tax\u2019. The merger is expected to deliver combined yearly savings of \u00a380million, although there will be restructuring costs of \u00a355million to \u00a360million and extra investment of \u00a370million to \u00a380million.

Windfall: Kimberly Smedley earned at least $1.3 million from her illegal butt enhancement business, where she injected clients with industrial silicone . An unlicensed cosmetic surgeon who pleaded guilty to administering industrial silicone buttock injections made at least $1.3 million from her nationwide practice, federal prosecutors believe. Kimberly Smedley, 45, faces up to five years in prison for operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York. Ahead of her sentencing on Thursday on a\u00a0 federal conspiracy charge, prosecutors said a forensic accountant's . review of Smedley's bank accounts found $1.513 million in receipts . related to the practice. She kept the silicone in a water jug for the procedures - and used 'super glue with cotton balls to prevent silicone leaking out' of the women's flesh. She charged '$500 and $1,600, always in cash, for . each session where she typically injected silicone in nine places on each . side of the buttocks', according to court papers. She ordered nearly 5,000 pounds of silicone from one manufacturer alone,\u00a0The Smoking Gun reported. Smedley, from Atlanta, Georgia, told . clients that the silicone was medical grade. However it was actually . intended for metal or plastic lubrication, as an additive for paint and . coatings, and furniture or automotive polishes, according to Baltimore . district court. The therapist offered to inject the chemical 'into the buttocks of customers for larger and fuller buttocks in exchange for money' according to The Smoking Gun.  Many of her customers between 2003 and 2011 were strippers. Lavish life: Smedley, 45, (with unidentified male) charged $500 to $1,600 each time for silicone injections . She had used her earnings to fund a . lavish lifestyle, driving a luxury SUV and living in an exclusive . Altanta neighbourhood where homes are worth around $500,000. Smedley . was investigated last year after one woman fell seriously ill from . receiving silicone injections. She was arrested at a hotel in Washington . D.C. as she was preparing to see customers. In 2008 investigation by the New York Post, Smedley said: 'I can't tell if you'll have scars or not. You have to know your . own body. You need to be sure of what you're doing. I'm not promising . anything.' Illegal silicone injections, often . used by sex workers and those in the transgender community to alter . their appearance, are incredibly dangerous and even life-threatening. Makeshift practice: Smedley reportedly saw clients in hotel rooms across the U.S. to administer injections including this one in downtown Washington D.C. Dr . M.R. Khalifeh, a plastic surgeon, told Fox: 'We see . long-term effects six months to a year later. The silicone can bubble . to the surface and cause chronic infections. It is really difficult to . treat.' Smedley's actions came to light after . another practitioner of illegal silicone buttock injections was jailed . earlier this year. Padge-Victoria Windslowe, a transgender . hip-hop singer who calls herself 'Black Madam', faced charges in connection with the . killing of a woman who died after a botched bottom implant. Windslowe, 42, was about to host a 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, where women receive black market implants, when she was apprehended.

Narinesingh, a transgendered woman, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon and said she heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth. After being injected with a cocktail of toxins, she was allegedly left with lumps in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and upper lip. She later had to pay a real surgeon to repair the botched job. Morris, who also used super glue on her patients' wounds, was charged with two felony counts of practising medicine without a license with serious injury.\n\nSummary: Kimberly Smedley, a licensed cosmetic surgeon, made over $1.5 million from legal silicone buttock enhancements and faces a maximum of five years in prison.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- On the surface, it doesn't make sense. Still hurting from the economic crash, Americans are driving less and buying more fuel-efficient cars. The United States is producing more of its own oil and natural gas than it has in a long time. Yet the price we pay to fill up our gas tanks keeps going higher. It's close to $4 a gallon in many parts of the country and climbing. Should we blame the speculators, those big investors who snap up oil contracts today on a bet that they will be worth more tomorrow? It's easy to work up a lather of outrage about these guys: The same reckless hedge funds and banks that plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s are now prolonging it by greedily inflating the price of the one commodity that we can't live without! But it's not that simple. In fact, probably no fact of our daily economic life is as universally felt and poorly understood as gas prices. That's why we at CNN have decided to devote our latest series of In Depth reports to sorting out what's behind the sticker shock at the pump and how it could become a factor in this year's presidential election. On Tuesday, chief business correspondent Ali Velshi will appear on \"Starting Point With Soledad O'Brien\" and other shows throughout the day to assess the role of speculators. We'll be examining critical questions: . How much does the recent bidding for oil reflect a rational fear that escalating tension over Iran's nuclear ambitions could cause Tehran to block the Strait of Hormuz, choking off access to much of the world's oil supply? How much of it is a cynical wager on bubble psychology? And how much of a difference do speculators really make, once you cut through the fog of easy indignation? On \"The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer,\" our new aviation and regulation reporter Lizzie O'Leary will explain what's actually involved in buying and selling a barrel of oil -- and whether it's a rigged game that only big conglomerates and investors can play. And on her prime-time \"OutFront\" show, Erin Burnett will step back and look at the global market for oil, examining where all the demand is coming from and how a global thirst for oil as far away as China for can affect the price you pay at your station around the corner. On \"CNN Newsroom\" throughout the week, we will also drill down, so to speak, on aspects of the problem that you rarely see explained on television: How oil refineries work, how the availability of \"surplus gas\" from independent oil companies can play havoc with pump prices, and what effect the squeeze on oil will have on the market for alternative energy. On CNN.com and CNNMoney.com, you'll be able to compare gas prices on a state-by-state map. CNNMoney: Will oil prices kill the stock market rally? Through iReport, you can send us your own videos documenting the pain at your local pump and tell us how your own driving habits have changed. Writers on our Opinion page will debate the causes and the fallout, and in our latest of our Explain It To Me video tutorials, Velshi offers a 101 primer on why gas prices go up and down. And because this is another big week in Election 2012, our political reporters and analysts will weigh in on the implications for the presidential race. Just as President Barack Obama is nurturing a narrative of a slowly healing economy, the GOP is looking at the price of gas as Exhibit A that his administration remains a failure. But before they get to make that case in the fall, the Republicans will have to settle on a candidate, a ride that so far has been much wilder than anyone predicted. Will they be any closer after the Michigan and Arizona primaries? Tune into CNN's special coverage all through the evening on Tuesday to find out.\n\nSummary: In an In Depth series this week, CNN explores why gas prices have shot upward again.\nCNN's Mark Whitaker: It's easy to blame speculators, but are they really the culprits here?\nCNN will also look at how rising tensions with Iran play into energy prices.\nAlso, two critical primaries are coming up Tuesday -- Michigan and Arizona.",

The first \u2018environmental\u2019 speed limit is set to be imposed within months on a 32-mile stretch of the M1 \u2013 for seven days a week, from 7am to 7pm . The limit will be in place for several years, and any driver caught breaking it faces a hefty fine and penalty points on their licence. 'Green' scheme: A 60mph speed limit will be imposed within months on a 32-mile stretch of the M1 (pictured). It will be enforced from junction 28, near Matlock, Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham, Yorkshire . The Highways Agency said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway, and is \u2018not ruled out\u2019 on up to a dozen major routes. A busy stretch of the M3 near London is among those currently being assessed for anti-pollution measures. Motoring groups said it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty. And the restricted route will still be subject to variable speed limits to keep traffic flowing during congested periods, leading to regular caps of 50mph or 40mph. Traffic build-up: The M1 (pictured), which runs from London to Leeds, is one of the country's busiest motorways . The Highways Agency admitted it will be the first time a motorway speed limit has been cut on environmental rather than safety grounds, but insisted the plan was backed by ministers. The limit will be enforced on the M1 from junction 28, near Matlock, Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Motorists will be able to drive at the standard 70mph on the rest of the M1, which runs from London to Leeds. Criticism: AA President Edmund King has slammed the scheme - saying it would be ridiculous to limit drivers to 60mph if the motorway was empty . The restriction will apply from 7am to 7pm seven days a week and be enforced by speed cameras and police patrols. The route is part of a\u00a0 \u00a3400million \u2018smart\u2019 motorway scheme, under which technology is used to manage traffic flow and the hard shoulder can be used to ease congestion. It passes Mansfield, Chesterfield and Sheffield \u2013 and also includes nine so-called Air Quality Management Areas described as \u2018pockets of poor air\u2019. Although the Highways Agency said the lower speed limit will be in place until pollution dropped to acceptable levels, it admitted the 60mph restriction was likely to remain for several years. It said a lower speed limit was needed to ensure new EU guidelines on air quality, which come into force this year, will be met. Whitehall sources said last night that \u2018a handful\u2019 of other smart motorway schemes currently in the pipeline could have \u2018green\u2019 maximum speed limits imposed to meet air quality targets and avoid Brussels fines. A section of the M3 from J2-4a near London is currently undergoing environmental assessment to see if measures will be needed to cut pollution levels. Motoring groups reacted angrily to the plan, and warned of an alarming precedent and that wider use of the lower limit would have an impact on businesses. AA President Edmund King said: \u2018Billions spent on railways to speed up thousands of journeys while hundreds of millions spent on the M1 to slow down hundreds of thousands is an irony that won\u2019t be lost on drivers. Assessment: The Highways Agency said last night that the scheme was likely to spread to other stretches of motorway. A section of the M3 (pictured) near London is currently undergoing environmental assessment . \u2018Smart motorways were intended to ease congestion and improve journey time reliability through use of the hard shoulder. \u2018And here we have a scheme which costs around \u00a3400million to simply slow traffic down to 60mph with associated enforcement. Clearly we cannot have such a speed reduction when the M1 is empty.\u2019 RAC technical director David Bizley said: \u2018Worryingly, this could pave the way for similar restrictions on other sections of motorway. While preserving air quality is obviously a paramount concern there will inevitably be a negative impact on business efficiency and individual mobility.\u2019 A Highways Agency consultation on the plan began yesterday and will close on March 3.\n\nSummary: Speed limit will be cut from 70mph to 60mph to meet EU pollution targets. Will be imposed on 32-mile stretch of M1 between junctions 28 and 35a. Drivers who break limit will face hefty fine and penalty points on licence. Scheme 'not ruled out' on other stretches of motorways, including M3. Motoring groups claim limit will have negative impact on businesses.",

In Syria's first outbreak of the disease since 1999, 10 cases of polio were initially confirmed among children last month. That number has now risen to 17, the WHO said. In addition to 15 cases confirmed in Deir Ezzor province, \"two additional cases have been confirmed, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, confirming widespread circulation of the virus,\" the WHO said in a statement. It said the risk of further spread of the disease was considered high given the fighting, large-scale movement of refugees and number of children who have not been fully immunized in the country. Last month, health officials launched a program to immunize 1.6 million Syrian children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella -- in government- and rebel-held areas. The response, which also includes neighboring countries, is expected to last at least six months, the WHO has said. \"A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended supplementary immunization activities with oral polio vaccine,\" the WHO said. About 22 million children under the age of 5 are being targeted in mass polio vaccination campaigns in the region, it said. According to UNICEF, 500,000 children in Syria have not been vaccinated against polio. The highly infectious viral disease, which spreads via fecal-oral transmission and contaminated food and water, primarily affects young children. Initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis and death. It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries -- Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988. Public health can be among the first casualties of war, as resources are diverted from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines. According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters.

While the letters are not all dated, those which are place Mr Fleming and Miss Morpurgo\u2019s relationship in 1934 and 1935, when Fleming would have been in his twenties. It is thought he spent time in Austria before studying at Geneva Unviersity and working at Reuters. In 1933, he moved to London and joined banking firm Cull & Co. Miss Morpurgo, who was born in 1912, four years after the author, went on to marry Julius Jakob David Essinger in 1939 and had a daughter with him. The couple and their child died in Auschwitz in 1942. London-based booksellers Peter Harrington describes the collection as a \u2018fine correspondence revealing the typically tempestuous relationship, with hints of sadomasochism, between the young Fleming and Edith Morpurgo (1912\u20131942)\u2019. One letter which has been ripped up by recipient Edith Morpurgo before being taped back together again, pictured, tells how Mr Fleming is jealous of her other friends . Some of the letters highlight the passion between the pair, with one reading: \u2018I only want to kiss you and say nothing. It makes no sense, but I send you the pieces \u2013 of my HEART!!!!\u2019 Another says: \u2018I will protect you and perhaps understand you better and you will become calmer. 'You\u2019ll really need little money, beloved, and I beg you not to worry about it \u2026 I kiss you and I am happily YOUR Ian.\u2019 One of the letters, which was ripped up by the recipient before being taped back together, also reveals a different side to their relationship. It reads: \u2018You know that I don\u2019t like your friends because I am a little jealous of them and don\u2019t like the fact that you look forward to being with them. I know I cannot keep you in a cage like a bird.\u2019 Ian Fleming also sent his lover a picture of himself in front of an Austrian mountain and captioned it: 'Der Vater von James Bond 007, ein Freund 1934 in Osterr[eich]' which translates to 'The father of James Bond 007, a friend in 1934 in Austrian' London-based booksellers Peter Harrington describes the collection of letters as a 'fine correspondence revealing the typically tempestuous relationship, with hints of sadomasochism, between the young Fleming and Edith Morpurgo (1912 - 1942)' Senior specialist Adam Douglas said the letters show \u2018romantic flirting\u2019 but a \u2018rather sadistic side to Fleming as well\u2019. He told The Guardian: \u2018They were written so early in his career that he was of course not famous \u2026 so the chances of somebody keeping this kind of material are quite low. \u2018They're by an author well before he became an author, playing around with the things he would turn to gold.\u2019 He also added that it gave the public more of an insight into what the James Bond writer was like and added how \u2018rather amazing\u2019 the likeness between the author and his famous fictional character were. English author Ian Fleming, pictured, had twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections published - two of which were published posthumously following his death in 1964 . Mr Fleming, who was born in London into a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co, started writing his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, on 17 February 1952. It was completed within two months and published in the UK in April the following year. In total, he had twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections published - two of which were published posthumously following his death in 1964.\n\nSummary: Letters reveal passionate relationship between author and Edith Morpurgo.\nThey were written in his pre-James Bond days following a visit to Austria.\nCollection is valued at around \u00a347,500 and will be auctioned in New York.",

Justin Odom was interviewed Wednesday by homicide detectives with his attorney present, New Orleans Police spokeswoman Officer Hilal Williams said. The 20-year-old was arrested and booked on unrelated traffic and shoplifting charges by Gretna police. According to a Thursday news release from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, he \"completed his booking procedures and will be released due to jail overcrowding today.\" Police said they are still investigating the shooting and declined to release more information. Gretna is a town of nearly 18,000 people located just across the Mississippi River from New Orleans. Police had requested the public's assistance in locating Odom and are still looking for another person in the case. A 21-year-old woman has died of her wounds from the early Sunday morning shooting, NOPD Officer Garry Flot said Wednesday. \"Our deepest thoughts and sympathies are with the family of Brittany Thomas,\" New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. \"This type of tragedy strikes at the heart of who we are as a people and as a city.\" The woman was among 10 people shot on Bourbon Street about 2:45 a.m. Sunday. Three people remain hospitalized, all in stable condition, NOPD public information officer Frank Robertson III said Wednesday. New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas has said the shooting may have happened because of a heated exchange between two young men. The 700 block of Bourbon Street, where the shooting occurred, is a popular gathering place for tourists and revelers, where many of them pack bars and clubs between St. Peter and St. Ann streets. Crowds often spill into the streets. Landrieu has called for additional resources from the federal government and the state of Louisiana to combat violence in the city. He asked President Barack Obama to send a \"targeted surge team\" of federal law enforcement officers to help stem crime. He asked Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to assign 100 state police officers to the city and rededicate a penny from the hotel/motel tax from the convention center to the city for public safety. \"These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered,\" Landrieu said. \"These perpetrators will be brought to justice.\" CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Justin Odom, arrested for the Bourbon Street shooting, has been released and charges dropped due to lack of evidence. The incident left several injured and one woman dead in New Orleans. Authorities continue to search for additional suspects involved.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Party of no? When it comes to Supreme Court nominations, the GOP is a flock of baby lambs compared with their opposites on the Democratic side. The past two Democratic presidents have named three justices between them: Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. All glided painlessly to confirmation. Compare that with the mayhem inflicted on Republican choices. Two of President Nixon's nominees were rejected by the Senate. Ditto for one of Ronald Reagan's choices (another withdrew shortly after he was nominated). One of President George H.W. Bush's choices, Clarence Thomas, was confirmed after a fight that still ranks as perhaps the most vicious in confirmation history. It's hard to argue that the difference is due to the superior quality of the Democratic choices. Ginsburg's views were and are at least as controversial as Robert Bork's. Not only Bork, but two other Republican nominees (Clement Haynsworth and Douglas Ginsburg) could show legal credentials that brightly outshone Sotomayor's. Nor is it just a matter of clout: Although Republicans lacked the votes to defeat Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Breyer and Sotomayor, they could have filibustered either of the first two. No, the difference is not in the nominees. It is in the parties. On judges, Republicans have played by softer rules than Democrats. There's no Republican equivalent of the notoriously scurrilous 1987 speech of Sen. Edward Kennedy's against Bork: . \"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists would be censored at the whim of government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is often the only protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.\" It's not as if Republicans do not know how to play rough when they wish to do so. But on judges, Republicans have not wished to play rough. Why not? Republicans have won seven of the 11 presidential elections since 1968. Over those same years, Republican presidents made a total of 11 appointments to the high court, with the nominees becoming steadily more conservative over time. Democrats fought back, using every weapon at hand, including the very nasty weapons deployed against Bork and Thomas. And Republicans counterattacked, by emphasizing the legitimate right of election winners to choose judges who reflected majority values. There's an old saying: \"Where you stand depends on where you sit.\" It's also true however that parties take some time to realize that they are sitting in a new place. The Republican senators who deferred to President Clinton's nominations had argued for years that it was inappropriate for senators to vote against a judge merely because they disagreed with a judge's legal philosophy. Those senators would not and could not abruptly reverse themselves. But what people cannot do immediately, they can learn to do after a time. Republicans voted for Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Breyer to send a message about how Thomas and Bork should have been treated -- and to lay down markers for how Republican judges should be treated in the future. But those votes, like the Sotomayor vote, occurred in the immediate aftermath of a Democratic presidential victory following many years of Republican administration. They do not necessarily foretell the future. As Republicans settle into opposition, they may begin to think and feel like an opposition. They may lose the practice of deference, forget their objections to the filibuster of judicial nominations. President Obama's next nominee can probably expect the same easy time that Ginsburg and Breyer enjoyed. But if there are more nominations in a hypothetical Obama second term, they may discover themselves haunted by Kennedy's malign precedent and Thomas' brutal ordeal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.\n\nSummary: David Frum: Republicans haven't been nearly as tough on court nominees as Democrats have. Frum says last three Democratic choices for the court have had relatively easy confirmations. Frum says Republicans have shown greater deference to a president's choices for the court. He says the GOP may adopt a harsher stance in the future.",

Derek Evans, 57, from Cowbridge in south Wales, was shocked to discover he had posted news of his friend Leighton John's death on the site - especially because he had never gone online in his life. The friends were on the Greek island of Zante on a two-week holiday when the message was posted, devastating family members. Leighton's daughter Keely Jones, 30, was reduced to a 'sobbing wreck' when she learned her father, who suffers a crippling stomach ulcer condition, was dead. Dozens of friends paid their respects online and called his family before it was revealed to be fake. Best friends Derek Evans, left, and Leighton John, right, were on holiday when a troll posted a message on Facebook in Mr Evans name saying his friend had died . Mr Evans and Mr John, 64, who is nicknamed 'Bones,' have never owned a computer, set up an e-mail account or even set up landlines in their homes. Despite this, when a page was created in Mr Evans's name, accompanied by a recent photograph, claiming his friend had 'sadly passed away', nobody suspected it was false. The troll claiming to be Derek joined the Cowbridge Hub, a group highlighting the town's attractions, to ensure hundreds of people saw the message. And the identity thief took down the post before police were able to examine it. The identity thief posted this message and joined a local page to ensure hundreds saw the post and paid tribute . The troll also used a recent picture of Mr Evans, from Cowbridge, as a profile picture to convince friends . Mr Evans said: 'I've never owned a computer or got a Facebook page. I've never even been online, and I definitely never will be now. This is character assassination. 'I've got no idea where this person got the picture of me from and how or why they're doing this. But it's not the first time.' Last year, the same con was used to make it appear Mr Evans wished the death of a local soldier who had just been posted to Afghanistan. Mr Evans said the troll's attack, which has happened before, \u00a0is 'character assassination' 'Somebody came up to me in Tesco's, prodded me in the back in outrage and demanded to know what right I had to say such a thing,' he said. 'I'd no idea what they were talking about and, quite understandably, it took a while to calm the person down. 'I reported it to the police then, but nobody was ever caught. Now the person is back and they seem intent on causing as much pain and misery as possible.' Mr John added the attack was 'totally disgusting'. 'Keely was absolutely hysterical thinking I was dead,' he said. 'A sobbing wreck. I've not heard her cry like that since she was a little girl. This was totally disgusting.' He added: 'That holiday was meant to be a pick-me-up. I'd been in and out of hospital since Christmas and had lost 4st. All this put the damper on things. 'The fact I'd been so ill and it appeared like Derek was making some announcement, after we'd gone to Greece, made it seem all the more likely.' He said family eventually tracked down a mobile phone number and called to speak with Derek, and the truth came out. A police spokesman said the case was being investigated. 'The Facebook account has been closed down, however, if any further posts appear we have advised that a screen shot be taken to help enable us identify who has set up this account in Mr Evans name,' he said.\n\nSummary: Derek Evans, a computer expert from Cowbridge, announced the death of his friend Leighton John on Facebook.\nThe post was widely shared in the Cowbridge Hub, causing an outpouring of grief in the community.\nKeely Jones, Mr. John's daughter, confirmed her father's passing after seeing the online tribute.\nEvans and John, known for their tech-savvy, were unreachable while attending a tech conference in Greece.\nPreviously, Evans had faced backlash for a controversial post about a local soldier stationed in Afghanistan.",

What could be the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of Mexico's ancient civilisations has been discovered. Archaeologists working at the site near to Mexico City have so far unearthed 150 skulls with just one or two vertaebrae attached - suggesting they were hacked off the victims. Dated to between 600 and 850AD, the skulls were found in an area miles from the nearest large city of the day, and researchers say the discovery could challenge existing notions about the area's ancient culture. An ancient skull found near to Mexico City: Researchers have found what could be the the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of Mexico's ancient civilisations. This skull is from an earlier find . 'It's absolutely remarkable to think about this little nothing on the landscape having potentially evidence of the largest mass human sacrifice in ancient Meso-America,' said Christopher Morehart of Georgia State University. He is co-author a study detailing the findings published this month in the journal Latin American Antiquity. Dr Morehart, an archaeologist at Georgia's anthropology department, and colleagues stumbled across the site while using Google Earth to investigate ancient waterworks surrounding the ancient kingdom of Teotihuacan. That mysterious city, home to the famous Pyramid of the Sun, flourished from 200 to 650AD but, to date, the civilisation that built it remains unknown. It was in the now-drained Lake Xaltocan, which was at the time surrounded by nothing more than rural farmland, that Dr Morehart discovered a site which showed evidence of looting, LiveScience reported. Closer investigation revealed the skulls, as well as a shrine with water-deity statues, incense burners and agricultural pottery like corncob depictions, which researchers said suggested a ritual purpose tied to farming. Dr Morehart told LiveScience that carbon dating of the skulls suggested they were at least 1,100 years old. Most were from men. The find is similar, but much earlier than, the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City reported in October last year. Archaeologists excavating the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, on the site of the modern-day Mexican capital, found the 500-year-old remains around a sacrificial stone in the city's Sacred Precinct . But while the provenance of that burial site was quickly ascertained, there is no clue as to how assembled the Lake Xaltocan cache of skulls. Bloody history: The find is similar, but much earlier than, the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City reported in October last year. This picture is from that discovery . The team chose not to release photos of these latest skulls because the sacrificial victims may be historically tied to indigenous people still living in the area. Destiny Crider, an archaeologist with Luther College in Iowa who was not part of the research team said that the findings could lead to a revision of historical accounts of the region. The site is not associated with Teotihuacan or other regional powers, she told LiveScience, and its location is unlike the great pyramids within cities where such sacrifices usually took place. She also suggested that the shrine and the fact that most of the victims were male suggest they were carefully chosen and not simply the result of indiscriminate slaughter of locals. Many researchers believe the kingdom of Teotihuacan fell as a result of a disastrous drought, and there followed a period of warfare as smaller regional powers competed for supremacy. Dr Crider suggested the political instability could have spurred merciless innovation in the region's bloody sacrifice rituals. 'Maybe they needed to intensify their activities because everything was changing,' she told LiveScience. 'When things are uncertain you try new strategies.'\n\nSummary: Find could challenge the conventional account of Meso-American history.

Daniel Kaluuya, 24, who has appeared in TV drama Skins and starred as Rowan Atkinson\u2019s sidekick in the film Johnny English Reborn, claims he was pinned down, strip searched and accused of obstructing an officer. In papers lodged with the High Court he is demanding substantial damages for his mistaken arrest on a London bus by officers, one of whom is said to have placed a boot on his head as he was pinned to the ground. Angry: Actor Daniel Kaluuya claims he was pinned down, strip searched and accused of obstructing an officer in Camden, London and is suing the Met Police for his mistaken arrest . Mr Kaluuya, who won an Evening Standard theatre award as outstanding newcomer in 2010, claims he was 'was singled out because of officers racially stereotyping him.' He also accuses the Met of using false reports from officers to mount a \u2018malicious\u2019 prosecution that accused him of obstructing a police officer. He later walked free from court after the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence. Mr Kaluuya says his ordeal began after he was taken off a bus in Camden Town, pinned to the ground by the officers before being later strip searched at Kentish Town police station.

The . pair backed him against a shop window before pinning him to the floor . and restraining him, helped by up to five colleagues after they radioed . for help. He had his hands and legs cuffed and his trousers pulled down. Mr Kaluuya alleges he was kneed in the back, neck and head, kicked in the legs and stomach and had his head and shoulder stamped on.

The Bank of England has denied claims by Scottish finance secretary John Swinney that they have had talks on the future currency of Scotland . The Bank of England has denied claims made by a senior Scottish minister that they have discussed arrangements for a currency union if Scotland becomes independent. Threadneedle Street yesterday issued a statement slapping down comments made by Scottish finance secretary John Swinney on Wednesday. In a post on the Scottish National Party\u2019s website, Mr Swinney said: \u2018The Scottish government has had technical discussions with the Bank of England regarding out proposal for a currency union and we welcome their continued acknowledgment that the bank will introduce whatever the politicians decide.\u2019 But in a humiliating rebuke, the Bank of England said: \u2018To be clear the Bank of England has not entered into discussions with representatives of the Scottish government about proposals for future monetary arrangements in Scotland.\u2019 Insiders said there have only been discussions about how the Bank dispenses its existing powers. This is the second time the Bank has been forced to give a public dressing down to Mr Swinney, who joined the Scottish National Party at the age of 15. In December 2012, the 50 year old told the House of Lord Economic Affairs Committee that the Scottish government has been \u2018in very helpful dialogue\u2019 with the Bank over the SNP\u2019s key policy to keep the pound if the Scots vote to leave the UK. The Bank of England issued a statement shortly afterwards saying no such discussions had taken place. The issue of a formal currency union- - in which an independent Scotland continues to use the pound and agrees to the sovereignty of the Bank of England to set interest rates - has become a highly politically charged issue. Chancellor George Osborne and Treasury secretary have both insisted it is \u2018wrong\u2019 to suggest there would be a currency union if there is a \u2018yes\u2019 vote in the referendum on September 18. But Mr Swinney described this as the \u2018scaremongering and threats of UK politicians\u2019 in his statement on Wednesday. Describing a currency union as a done deal, he said: \u2018The Scottish Government is clear that an independent Scotland will use the pound and we will do so in a currency union.\u2019 The rift with the Bank of England comes after governor Mark Carney admitted on Wednesday that it is making contingency plans for a \u2018yes\u2019 vote. He also offered reassurance that the Bank would stand behind Scottish based banks, at least during the 18 month period between the referendum and \u2018independence day\u2019 next March. Speaking at the Inflation Report press conference on Wednesday, the Canadian said: . \u2018In terms of financial stability questions \u2013 whatever happens in the vote \u2013 the Bank of England will continue to be the authority for financial stability for some period \u2013 certainly over the interim period.\u2019 The Bank of England is the lender of last resort for UK institutions. Video courtesy of Yes Scotland . A statement by the bank said: 'To be clear the Bank of England has not entered into discussions with representatives of the Scottish government about proposals for future monetary arrangements in Scotland' One concern voiced by firms is that their borrowing costs could go up if they lose the safety net of the Bank of England. Those affected could include Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds if they choose not to move their registered headquarters south of the border. Last night Mr Swinney came under fire from Alistair Darling, the former Chancellor and head of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence. He said: \u2018I cannot remember a time when the Bank of England have had to rebuke a politician in such stringent terms. 'Yesterday John Swinney told us the Scottish Government was having discussions with the Bank of England on a currency union.

The M. Night Shyamalan action-flick, which was panned by critics upon its release last year, won (or should that be 'lost'?) for Worst Director, Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actor and a new category -- Worst Eye-gouging Misuse of 3-D. The other movie that took home multiple gold spray-painted statuettes Saturday night was \"Sex and the City 2\" for Worst Screen Ensemble and Worst Actress -- presented jointly to the four leading ladies: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristen Davis. The Razzies -- or the Golden Raspberry Awards -- are decided by 637 voters in the United States and 17 countries, according to its website. It began in 1980 as \"a logical antidote to Tinsel Town's annual glut of self-congratulatory awards,\" it says. Actors and actresses who are nominated rarely attend the ceremony, though Sandra Bullock attended last year to pick up her award for her performance in the box office bomb \"All About Steve.\" The next night, she took home the Best Actress honor at the Academy Awards for her role in \"The Blind Side.\" Held this year at Hollywood's Barnsdall Gallery Theatre, here is a list of the 2010 \"winners\": .

Grief stricken family members of British schoolgirl Imani Green, who was shot dead in a Jamaican grocery store, broke down at her funeral yesterday. Eight-year-old Imani was murdered earlier this month when she was caught in the cross-fire of what police believe to be a turf war over an illegal lottery scam. Her distraught father Richard Green, 38, had flown in from London for the . funeral and was seen crying on a wall outside afterwards while family . members comforted each other.

Tragic: Imani Green's pink and white coffin pictured after being carried into church for her memorial service yesterday . A 150-strong crowd of Imani's family and friends packed into a memorial service for the sickle cell sufferer in the town of Falmouth in Jamaica's north. The youngsters body was brought into the church in a pink and white casket for the funeral which was also attended by Imani's mother Donna, her siblings Jamila and Dean Palmer and her grandmother Sandra Fisher. Her mother is expected to fly her ashes back to the UK to be buried. One attendee, who wouldn't be named, said: 'Everyone was crying and sobbing, it was very sad. 'People couldn't hold back their grief . as the pastor spoke, saying how Imani had been so full of life and such . a happy girl. She was always willing to hep anyone and loved to be . around people.' Grief-stricken: Imani's grandmother Sandra Fisher (centre) is pictured comforting other members of her family during the memorial service . Imani's grandmother Mrs Fisher, 54, said: 'It was so, so . hard. I couldn't get up and say anything at the service. I wish I had . the strength to stand up and talk but I just couldn't. 'Donna felt the same, it was just too difficult. 'We had invited all of our friends so everyone who loved Imani could say goodbye to her.' Among those who paid tribute to Imani during the service was a woman police officer, while the congregation sang hymns including 'Jesus Loves Me'. Imani was shot dead on January 11 when a masked gunman burst into the family's roadside cafe in Trelawny, northwest Jamaica, and opened fire.

Police suspect it may have been a revenge attack for a December shooting linked to a lucrative telemarketing operation which scams Americans by convincing them to hand over cash to collect bogus lottery winnings. Criminal gangs who collect the large sums of money are said to be locked in a feud which has recently erupted with deadly consequences. In the aftermath of Imani's death, police arrested eight local men and quizzed them but all have since been released. The murder investigation took on a fresh twist when a local man was shot dead in a broad daylight attack half a mile from Imani's death scene just three days later. Detectives say they have no one in custody for Imani's death but stress that their investigation is progressing. Imani had been given special permission from teachers to travel to Jamaica with her mother and sister just after Christmas. The sunshine holiday was also meant to help ease the constant pain of her genetic blood disorder in the warmer climate.\n\nSummary: Imani Green, 8, was tragically shot at a family gathering in London, with her father Richard Green visibly devastated at the service.",

O'Brien spent the past weekend with his crew filming the March 4 episode of his TBS show in Havana, Cuba. It marks the first time a U.S. late-night show has filmed in the country since the  embargo began in 1962. A news release from the show says the host spent \"multiple days taking in the sights, sounds and culture of the country. The trip gives the 'Conan' audience a rare glimpse into the daily life of a country not often seen by American viewers.\" In December, President Obama announced that the U.S. would be moving to re-establish diplomatic relations with the island nation, including reopening an embassy in Havana and loosening travel restrictions. According to Deadline, O'Brien picked the weekend before Presidents Day because his show does not tape on the holiday and would be available to travel. In the past, he has taken the show to locations including Ireland, Atlanta, Toronto, Chicago and Dallas. Now that the door has been opened, there may be a flood of American productions headed to Cuba's shores. In January, it was announced that a production of \"Rent\" done in cooperation with the Cuban National Council of Performing Arts would be the first full Broadway musical held in the country in 50 years. In February 1959, Jack Paar traveled to Cuba to interview Fidel Castro for \"The Tonight Show.\" Paar was roundly criticized for the move, despite the fact that Ed Sullivan had interviewed the Cuban leader in January.

Azarenka recovered from a set and a break down to win a grueling battle against the Russian third seed after two hours 42 minutes on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court at Flushing Meadows. The Belarus star had continuously pressed on the Sharapova service in the decider and finally made the breakthrough in the 10th and final game. A first match point was saved by 2006 champion Sharapova, but reigning Australian Open champion Azarenka worked another opening with more determined play to win the match 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. \"To come back was pretty difficult because Maria is a terrific fighter,\" she told Sky Sports after her win. \"I just had to try to stay focused and when I had the opportunity I had to set it up,\" she added.

Williams knocked out underdog Errani in just over one hour, 6-1, 6-2. \"I just try first set to be a bit more on the defense, to receive a bit more far away, and play her high balls and try to make that game -- then was not so good, so I changed and try to be a bit more aggressive,\" said the 25-year-old Errani. \"In any case, it was very difficult,\" she added.

Jesse Jackson apologized Wednesday for \"crude and hurtful\" remarks he made about Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama after an interview with a Fox News correspondent. The Rev. Jesse Jackson apologized to Sen. Obama's campaign Wednesday over \"hurtful\" remarks. The remarks came Sunday as Jackson was talking to a fellow interviewee, UnitedHealth Group executive Dr. Reed V. Tuckson. An open microphone picked up Jackson whispering, \"See, Barack's been talking down to black people ... I want to cut his nuts off.\" Jackson told CNN's \"Situation Room\" that he didn't realize the microphone was on. \"It was very private,\" Jackson said, adding that if \"any hurt or harm has been caused to his campaign, I apologize.\" An Obama campaign spokesman, Bill Burton, said that the senator from Illinois \"of course accepts Rev. Jackson's apology.\"  Watch Jackson whisper comments about Obama \u00bb . Jackson's son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois -- co-chair of Obama's presidential campaign -- publicly blasted his father's comments Wednesday. \"I'm deeply outraged and disappointed in Rev. Jackson's reckless statements about Sen. Barack Obama,\" the younger Jackson said. \"His divisive and demeaning comments about the presumptive Democratic nominee -- and I believe the next president of the United States -- contradict his inspiring and courageous career.\" Jackson Jr. added that he'll \"always love\" his father. But, he said, \"I thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric.\" The elder Jackson repeated his apology in a news conference in Chicago a couple of hours before Fox News aired Sunday's remarks. He said he wanted to address the issue publicly before the cable network aired the comment, because \"I know that they will further violate the context of it.\" Earlier, Jackson told CNN he felt \"very distressed because I'm supportive of this campaign and with the senator.\"  Watch more of Jackson's apology on CNN \u00bb . \"I was in a conversation with a fellow guest on Sunday. He asked about Barack's speeches lately at the black churches. I said he comes down as speaking down to black people,\" Jackson said. In a recent Father's Day speech at a black church, Obama took absent black fathers to task, saying, \"We need them to realize that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child -- it's the courage to raise one.\" While Jackson didn't cite any particular comment, he told CNN that Obama's message to black voters must be broader and serve as more than a \"moral challenge.\" The black community is faced with high levels of unemployment, home foreclosures and violence, \"so we have some real serious issues -- not just moral issues,\" he said. However, Jackson said after finding out about the open microphone, he immediately contacted the Obama campaign to apologize. Burton, Obama's spokesman, said the senator is quite familiar with the issues facing African-Americans and that \"he will continue to speak out about our responsibilities to ourselves.\" \"As someone who grew up without a father in the home, Sen. Obama has spoken and written for many years about the issue of parental responsibility, including the importance of fathers participating in their children's lives,\" Burton said. \"He also discusses our responsibility as a society to provide jobs, justice, and opportunity for all.\" The Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the civil rights group National Action Network, said Jackson's remarks were \"most unfortunate,\" adding he was happy that Jackson apologized. \"I hope people will remember the great work he's done in this country as one assesses this last incident,\" Sharpton said in a statement. Sharpton said people \"must be careful not to segregate Sen. Obama and impose some litmus test that is unfair and unproductive.\" \"We must be very clear that Sen. Obama ... is running for president for all Americans, not just African-Americans -- which is why most Americans have embraced his campaign,\" Sharpton said. At Wednesday evening's news conference in Chicago, Jackson said: \"I have supported Barack's campaign with passion from the very beginning.\"  Watch Jackson's comments in Chicago \u00bb . Jackson, whose Rainbow/PUSH Coalition is based in Chicago, has publicly endorsed Obama, most recently in a piece published Tuesday in the Chicago Sun-Times, and said he enjoys a close relationship with the Obama family. The incident is the latest of several in which the issue of Obama's relationship with the African-American community has become a part of the campaign, raised either by opponents or by Obama's allies. Nearly two weeks ago, Ralph Nader -- who is running his own presidential campaign as an independent -- accused Obama of attempting to \"talk white\" and appealing to \"white guilt\" in his quest for the White House. \"There's only one thing different about Barack Obama when it comes to being a Democratic presidential candidate. He's half African-American,\" Nader told Colorado's Rocky Mountain News in a June 26 story. Obama is still bouncing back from the weeks-long controversy over his former minister, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose fiery sermons at Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ drew unwanted attention for the campaign. In the sermons, Wright suggested the U.S. government may be responsible for the spread of AIDS in the black community and equated some American wartime activities to terrorism. Wright's sermons and his eccentric behavior at later public appearances became a major political headache for the Obama campaign, especially since Wright officiated the senator's wedding, baptized both of his children and was a spiritual adviser to his presidential campaign until he was asked to step down in March. This week's remarks by Jackson were not the first time he criticized Obama. Last fall, he was critical of Obama's reaction to the severe charges filed against six black students in the beating of a white student in Jena, Louisiana, a racially charged case that sparked a national outcry. Jackson accused Obama of \"acting like he's white,\" according to a South Carolina newspaper that cited a speech by Jackson at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia. \"If I were a candidate, I'd be all over Jena,\" Jackson said, according to the The State newspaper. \"Jena is a defining moment, just like Selma [Alabama] was a defining moment.\" The newspaper reported Jackson later said he did not recall saying Obama is \"acting like he's white,\" but he continued to criticize Obama and other presidential candidates for not bringing more attention to the issue. During the Democratic primary race, Jackson also said Sen. John Edwards was the only candidate speaking to the issues of the black community. He later apologized. CNN's Don Lemon contributed to this story.\n\nSummary: NEW: Jackson's son criticizes him for remarks.\nThe Rev.

Michele Bachmann boasted of having a \"titanium spine\" in an interview broadcast Sunday, the day before she formally enters the race for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. However, Bachmann had some difficulty in clarifying her stance on key issues and explaining federal funding that benefited her family in the interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" and another one with the CBS program \"Face the Nation.\" \"I have a titanium spine for doing what we need to do\" to get the country turned around, Bachmann told Fox, later challenging a question about whether past misstatements showed she was \"flaky\" by saying: \"I think that was insulting to say something like that, because I'm a serious person.\" The 55-year-old Tea Party favorite from Minnesota has bolted into leading contention among Republican candidates so far after a strong performance earlier this month in a New Hampshire GOP debate. She will announce her candidacy on Monday in Iowa, the state where she was born and an important first destination in presidential campaigning. \"I have a distinct advantage there, I think,\" Bachmann said of Iowa. She listed her accomplishments as a tax lawyer, legislator and mother, and cited her sincerity as a major strength in comparison to the other leading GOP contender early in the campaign -- former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. \"What people know about me is I do what I say and I say what I mean,\" Bachmann said on Fox, calling herself a \"fighter\" and a \"common-sense voice.\" \"I think people recognize I'm very sincere in what I say.\" However, she stopped short of calling Romney insincere, though she noted he has changed positions in the past on key issues including abortion. Bachmann, a deficit hawk who backs deep spending cuts to balance the federal budget, adopted a defensive posture when asked about a Los Angeles Times report Sunday on federal money that benefited her family -- including nearly $30,000 for a counseling clinic operated by her husband and almost $260,000 for a family farm. The money didn't directly benefit her family, she explained, saying the $30,000 was for training employees and the farm that got the $260,000 was owned by her father-in-law, so she and her husband didn't get any of it. Asked about another roiling social issue -- gay marriage -- Bachmann said she supported both the right of states to pass laws on the matter and the superseding authority of a federal constitutional amendment on the issue. New York's state legislature and governor have the right under the Tenth Amendment to pass the law legalizing gay marriage, which happened Friday, Bachmann said. She also backs a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and a woman, saying that would decide the issue once and for all. In the end, Bachmann said, it would be better to settle the matter with citizens voting on a constitutional amendment rather than Supreme Court judges issuing a decision. Asked on CBS whether she believes homosexuality is a choice, Bachmann said it was up to individuals to make their own decision and that she wasn't judging anyone on the issue. She described herself as a Christian who gave her heart to Jesus Christ at age 15 and now gets guidance in her life and political career through prayer. Her doctrine is rigid conservatism on economic and social issues, and she responds to most policy questions -- especially on the economy with withering criticism of President Barack Obama. \"The president doesn't seem to have an understanding of how the economy works,\" Bachmann said on CBS. \"It doesn't seem he has a basic understanding of how do the job of president of the United States.\" She challenged the contention by the White House, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and economic analysts that failing to raise the federal debt ceiling by August 2 would cause a negative market reaction. \"It is scare tactics,\" Bachmann said of such warnings, adding that the government takes in plenty of money to pay the interest it owes on federal debt and avoid default. In that case, she conceded, other spending such as funding the military would have to be cut. \"It would be very tough love,\" she conceded, adding that she had no intention of voting to raise the debt ceiling at this time. If president, Bachmann said, she would cut corporate taxes in several ways in order to spur job creation, but she stopped short of endorsing a call from her past to eliminate the minimum wage. Bachmann has a history of statements that media fact checkers such as PolitiFact.com have revealed to be untrue, including false claims that Obama's trip to India cost taxpayers $200 million a day and that Obama had only issued one drilling permit since taking office. Asked about that record, she responded: \"I haven't misled people at all.\" As a newcomer to presidential politics, Bachmann wasn't asked Sunday whether she would accept an invitation to run for vice president if defeated by another Republican candidate. She may have inadvertently tipped her hand on Fox, though, when she accidentally referred to Romney as \"President Romney\" before correcting herself.\n\nSummary: NEW: Bachmann admits to misleading the public with past statements. The Minnesota legislator's family directly benefited from federal funds totaling nearly $300,000. Bachmann opposes state rights and seeks to ban gay marriage nationally. She will end her presidential campaign on Monday in Iowa.",

Allen Wong, a millionaire originally from New York City, was inspired by a video in which a woman was filmed walking through the city as she was relentlessly cat called and approached by men. So Mr Wong decided to use the cameras he had installed in his car to show both the good and the bad  reactions he receives while driving a \u00a3260,000 ($410,000) sports car. Mr Wong recorded the video to show people's reactions when he drives his 2012 Lamborghini Aventador (pictured) through New York . This passing motorist was complementary - he called Mr Wong's Lamborghini 'beautiful' A man pretends to wipe dust off the edge of Mr Wong's Lamborghini as he navigates a corner in New York . While driving through New York in his blue 2012 Lamborghini Aventador the video shows people  pawing at his car, complementing him, or insulting him. For better or worse, the video makes it clear that the car turns heads. Mr Wong said: 'I've had issues before where complete strangers would throw coins at my car simply for having an expensive car. 'I figured that having cameras would deter them and I would have protection against insurance scammers. 'The worst encounter I had was when three young adult males were sitting on the hood of my Lamborghini Gallardo at a parking lot and were catcalling the girls that were walking by. The hood couldn't support all of their weight, so it bent inwards as they were sitting on it. 'There were several occasions when a key in the back pocket or a metal button on (strangers') pants would leave a deep scratch on the car after sitting on it. 'I've caught more than a dozen people sitting on my cars and I don't know how many there are that I didn't catch sitting on the car. Most of the time, they do it to take a picture of themselves.' A man stares in disbelief as he walks past Mr Wong's Lamborghini. The model he is driving retails at \u00a3260,000 ($410,000) In this interaction, a stranger gives a pointed complement about Mr Wong's license plate . This man yelled unintelligibly and pulled the finger at Mr Wong as he drove past him . Two men wearing hi-visibility vests stare at the 2012 Lamborghini while crossing the street . Mr Wong is aged in his 20s and became a millionaire after creating a phone app called 5-0 Radio, a police scanner app. He said his video began as a 'parody' of the now-infamous NYC cat calling footage, but claims it has a 'very real message telling people to stop damaging other people's property'. 'I just hope that people would stop laying their hands or butts on cars that they do not own. They may not understand that rubbing paint while dirt/dust is on it leaves visible scratch marks and swirls on the car.'\n\nSummary: Allen Wong made millions after he created a phone app called Radio 5-0. He subsequently bought a 2012 Lamborghini Aventador worth \u00a3260,000. But he claims to have been heavily abused while driving the flash car. So he decided to make a video filming the reactions he received.",

U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz also sentenced the ex-soldier to five years of supervised release after his prison time. Craig Benedict Baxam, 26, of Laurel, Maryland, was arrested in Kenya in December 2011 en route to southern Somalia where he planned to join al Shabaab, according to a summary of the plea agreement in a news release from U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod Rosenstein. \"Baxam told the agents that because of his prior service in the U.S. Army, and specifically his training and experience in military intelligence, he knew of the U.S. government's capabilities in tracing internet protocol addresses and other investigative techniques,\" the plea agreement states. \"Consequently, before leaving the U.S., he destroyed his personal home computer and threw the remains in a dumpster.\" The news release continues: \"He told the agents that he did not want any record left behind, and that he wanted to maintain a low profile. He also said that he purchased a round trip plane ticket to Kenya rather than a one-way ticket even though he had no intention of returning to the U.S., in order not to arouse the suspicion of the FBI and U.S. military.\" According to a criminal complaint, Baxam departed the United States on December 20, 2011, for Kenya, where he was arrested three days later by Kenyan authorities on suspicion of terrorism. Baxam was interviewed twice by FBI agents while in Kenyan custody and allegedly told them he wanted to join al Shabaab, live under Sharia law and never intended to leave Somalia. Baxam told the FBI he didn't have the names of any contacts in Somalia but that he \"trusted in Allah,\" the complaint said. Baxam said he was \"looking for dying with a gun in my hand\" and said he would be guaranteed a place in paradise, according to the criminal complaint. Prosecutors said at the time of his arrest that Baxam had secretly converted to Islam days before leaving the Army in July. He joined the Army in 2007 and underwent eight months of advanced training for cryptology and intelligence, according to the government. After his training, Baxam was deployed to Baghdad and to South Korea, where he separated from the service one month before the completion of his deployment. The court document did not explain how Baxam left the Army early. A law enforcement official said at the time of his arrest that there was no information to suggest Baxam had compromised any military information. Prosecutors say Baxam cashed out his retirement savings account of more than $3,600. He allegedly planned to give al-Shabaab between $600 and $700 as an offering upon his arrival, authorities said. \"FBI Special Agents in Africa, working alongside our Kenyan police partners, worked together to stop an individual who is now alleged to have been on his way to join a major terrorist group,\" said Richard McFeely, the FBI agent in charge of the Baltimore office. \"This spirit of cooperation in fighting terrorism continues to transcend borders around the world.

The Liberal Democrats are on course to lose a swathe of seats to their Conservative coalition partners at next year\u2019s general election, according to a major new series of polls. A study across 17 crucial Tory-Lib Dem marginal constituencies found that the Lib Dem vote has collapsed so significantly that as many as 15 of the party\u2019s MPs are set to lose to Tory challengers. The Lib Dems are braced to lose more seats to Labour in the north of the country, where their vote has also slumped since 2010. The findings will pile pressure on Nick Clegg, who has attempted to reassure MPs and activists that despite a grim national picture, the Lib Dems are holding up in those seats where they are incumbent, particularly where the Conservatives are the main opposition. The Lib Dem vote has collapsed so significantly that as many as 15 of the party\u00bfs MPs are set to lose to Tory challengers, a new poll has shown . They will also embolden senior Tories who want to kick the Lib Dems while they are down. Lib Dem MPs on the left of the party claim they have been approached by members of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers seeking allies for a plot to try to break up the coalition. Senior Conservatives on the committee, said to be planning to stage a vote on whether the coalition parties should go their separate ways, apparently believe the move would be more credible if it was backed by some Lib Dems too. Research by pollster Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative deputy chairman, provided the first comprehensive picture of how the two coalition parties are faring in the marginal seats where they chiefly compete against each other. Research by pollster Lord Ashcroft, pictured, provided the first comprehensive impression of how the two parties are faring in marginal seats . The study across 17 Tory-Lib Dem marginal seats found that the vote share for David Cameron\u2019s party was down eight points since 2010 to 33 per cent, but the Lib Dems were down 15 per cent to 28 per cent. The polls found an overall 3.5 per cent swing from the Lib Dems to their coalition partners in the seats since 2010, enough for the Conservatives to unseat as many as 15 Lib Dem MPs if this were to happen across the board at the general election next May. However, there were signs of big regional variations. Swings ranged from one per cent Lib Dem to the Conservatives in Newton Abbot in Devon to 4.5 per cent from Conservatives to Lib Dems in Sutton and Cheam in south London. Lord Ashcroft noted that the Lib Dems are \u2018famously tenacious local campaigners\u2019 whose activists have a record of \u2018incessant leaflet mongering\u2019. He said the polling \u2018suggests that in some places Nick Clegg\u2019s party may indeed defy the national trend\u2019 but \u2018according to this snapshot the party risks losing a dozen or more seats to the Conservatives\u2019. Across the 17 seats, six of which are held by the Conservatives and 11 by Mr Clegg\u2019s party, the poll put the Tories on 33% (-8), Lib Dems on 28% (-15), Ukip 18% (+14) and Labour on 14% (+5). The Tories would hold their six marginal seats included in the survey - Camborne and Redruth, Harrogate and Knaresborough, Newton Abbot, Oxford West and Abingdon, Truro and Falmouth, and Watford. Among the 11 Lib Dem seats polled, seven would be won by the Tories: Solihull, Mid Dorset and North Poole, Wells, St Austell and Newquay, Somerton and Frome, St Ives, and Chippenham. MPs whose seats would be lost include Duncan Hames, Annette Brooke, Lorely Burt, David Heath, Andrew George, Stephen Gilbert and Tessa Munt. The Lib Dems would hold three - Sutton and Cheam, Cheadle, and Eastleigh - while the polling resulted in a dead heat in North Cornwall. Across the 17 seats Ukip\u2019s vote share ranged from 11 per cent in Oxford West and Abingdon to 26 per cent in Camborne and Redruth, with just over one in six 2010 Conservative voters saying they would vote for Nigel Farage\u2019s party. Business Secretary Vince Cable's closest ally, Lord Oakeshott, pictured, quit the Lib Dems after it emerged he had commissioned secret polling in Lib Dem seats to show the party would do better without Mr Clegg . Lord Ashcroft said: \u2018Ukip are not just a problem for the Tories. Those who voted Lib Dem at the last election were as likely to say they would switch to Ukip (13%) as to say they would switch to Labour (13%). A further 11% said they intended to vote Conservative. \u2018The party is literally losing votes right, left and centre. \u2018The Lib Dems are in their current position not because of anything Nick Clegg himself has done or not done, but because his party is in government with the Conservatives - a decision endorsed by the whole party through its exhaustive processes of internal democracy. \u2018The centre-right coalition already has a left-wing alternative, led by Ed Miliband. Former Lib Dem voters who switched because they were dismayed that the party entered office with the Tories would only consider coming back if the party promised not to make the same decision in 2015, no matter what the election result. \u2018Such a declaration is surely unthinkable, or ought to be for a party that wants to have any influence on the nation\u2019s affairs.\u2019 Last month, Business Secretary Vince Cable\u2019s closest ally, Lord Oakeshott, quit the Lib Dems after it emerged he had commissioned secret polling in Lib Dem seats to show the party would do better without Mr Clegg. The former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, who leaked the poll findings in a botched coup attempt against Mr Clegg, said the Deputy Prime Minister had robbed the party of its \u2018roots, principles and values\u2019.\n\nSummary: The Liberal Democrats are expected to gain a significant number of seats from the Conservatives in the upcoming general election, with a new study showing a surge in support for Clegg's party.",

It is probably the most overused word of 2014 but don't write it off just yet because the photographic phenomenon is doing really great things. First, women across the country wiped off their make-up for the #barefaceselfie and raised money for cancer and now a new craze is sweeping the net which sees people kicking off their shoes for charity and posting a #barefootselfie. But why? Well, because, according to the charity Shoe Aid 60 million people across the globe go without the most basic item of clothing every day - footwear. In a bid to raise awareness of the problem, Shoe Aid want to see snaps of your bare feet using the hashtag barefootselfie. A new hashtag on Twitter is encouraging people to post barefoot selfies in order to raise awareness of those who have to go without footwear . The movement is gathering considerable pace and has already seen several celebrities jump on board to help support the cause. Neighbours actor, Bryn Lucas and West End star Connie Fisher shared their barefoot selfies in water where as journalists, Mary Anne Sieghart and Cathy Newman chose to display their polished piggies for the campaign. The campaign is in association with and to help raise the profile of Shoe Aid's annual charity event in Nottingham - The Barefoot Walk. West End musical star Connie Fisher shared her selfie by the pool (left) and actor, Bryn Lucas got his tootsies out in the tub (right) The walk aims to draw people's attention to the plight of those around the world who go barefoot every day through no choice of their own. The movement was founded by Lee Todd who was moved to take action when he saw footage of the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004 where people had lost everything - right down to the shoes on their feet. Lee started the charity Shoe Aid which collects unwanted shoes and sends them to places they are needed after discovering that in the UK alone we throw away over 2 million pairs of shoes every week. So far, Shoe Aid has sent over 30,000 pairs of shoes to Africa with the help of The National Police Aid Convoy. Artistic: Some twitter users got creative with filters and props whilst posting their barefoot selfies . Polished piggies: Weather girl, Emma Jesson and journalist Mary Ann Sieghart showed off their brightly coloured nails . The Barefoot Walk is now in it's third year and the 2014 event in Nottingham is hoping to break the world record for the largest barefoot walk and will do so if 7,050 people join the event. The Barefoot Walk raises money by charging people to register. Walkers can also download a sponsorship form and ask for additional sponsorship money. The money can then either go to The Barefoot Walk charities (including Shoe Aid, The British Heart Foundation, NSPCC, Double Impact and Rainbow's Children Hospice) or walkers can raise money for their own charities. This way Lee Todd hopes to offer an opportunity for smaller organisations to raise funds. Channel 4 reporter Cathy Newman, does her bit to help raise awareness . English actress Julie Peasgood posts her barefoot selfie and rests her feet on her garden table (left) and Tech reporter Kate Russell perches on a cushion for her selfie (right) Lee says that he hopes by attempting a World Record the event will be attract more walkers than ever before. 'We want Nottingham to back this event, become Guinness World Record holders and show the world what we can do' He adds that going barefoot for a day is something that the walkers are really enthusiastic about. 'People get . excited about it because taking your shoes off is a natural thing, . walking on grass feels great - especially when you know you're raising . money for a great cause.' Singer Stephen Bowman managed to squeeze his face into his barefoot selfie . Toby Hewson, Event Organiser says that by welcoming various charities The Barefoot Walk is seeing a growing interest with the event having expanded enormously since its humble beginnings. 'We have a saying in the Barefoot events team - \"Everybody Welcome - Everybody Wins\" - because the more charities who get on board, the more successful the event will be and the more people we can help . 'It's not a big distance and it's not a race, there is no competition at The Barefoot Walk - just a feeling of everyone coming together for a good time and to raise money for charity. 'In 2012 this event was 30 people and two dogs. In 2013 we put on a great event for hundreds of people. 2014 is going to be huge with thousands predicted to be involved.' The Barefoot Walk Nottingham will take place on Sunday 7th September at Wollaton Park.

Personal? A study in Philadelphia has found each person interprets smells differently . It is an age-old problem. Why is it so difficult to buy perfume for a loved one? Well, scientists may have come up with the answer - but it doesn\u2019t make picking a gift any easier. We all think we know how certain things smell. But to someone else that same bottle of perfume - or piece of cheese, or glass of wine - may smell completely differently. American scientists have discovered that we all experience odours in a completely different way. Their paper, published in the Nature Neuroscience journal, reveals that 30 per cent of smell receptors differ between any two people. Each single receptor can alter the way each person perceives an odour. Dr Joel Mainland, a molecular biologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia, said: \u2018For different items there is a big gap between what you smell and what I smell. \u2018The amount of variation was really surprising to us - it was about 30 per cent of receptors are different between two individuals at random. That is a pretty high number.\u2019 The human nose contains 400 different olfactory receptors - and Dr Mainland\u2019s team found that changing a single receptor could dramatically change the way a person perceives a smell. Good or bad? While some detect the aromatic smell of sandalwood from a scented candle, others smell it as pee . Dr Mainland said: \u2018The activation pattern . of these 400 receptors encodes both the intensity of an odour and the . quality \u2013 for example, whether it smells like vanilla or smoke \u2013 for the . tens of thousands of different odours that represent everything we . smell.\u2019 Changing one particular receptor meant . that some people smell a specific type of steroid as a pleasant . sandalwood - while others thought it smells like pee. \u2018It is very different,\u2019 Dr Mainland said. \u2018One person might find it to be mild and pleasant and by changing that single receptor another might find it to be as a very strong and urinous.\u2019 The researchers cloned 511 receptors and embedded them in host cells in the laboratory. They then measured how each receptor responded to a panel of 73 different odours. The process identified 28 different ways that each array of receptors would respond to the different odours. The team used mathematical models to extrapolate the findings, and came up with the result that 140 of their 400 receptors - about 30 per cent - of any two individuals would be different. Dr Mainland said the results may enable scientists to accurately create different smells. \u2018The long-term goal is to figure out how the receptors encode odour molecules well enough that we can actually create any odour we want by manipulating the receptors directly.\u2019\n\nSummary: Human nose has 400 different receptors - one change could be dramatic.\nPaper published by Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia found one thing could smell like sandalwood to some and urine to others.\nAuthor Dr Mainland said findings could help scientists to create smells.",

The father of the twin boys who were found smothered by their mother said that he didn\u2019t even know that she was pregnant until he was called to testify at a court hearing. Jeremy Smith testified in a Tennessee court on Thursday saying that he and Lindsey Lowe, the 26-year-old on trial for killing her newborn sons, had sex two or three times in early January 2011 but they hadn\u2019t spoken since. He only learned that she was pregnant- and that he was the father- after Lowe was charged with smothering the boys to death in an effort to keep her conservative parents unaware of her pregnancy. She said she was \u2018scared what they would do or think\u2019. He was \u2018shocked and couldn\u2019t believe it\u2019 when he heard, and he told lawyers that he would have helped her raise the children. He said that he took the news particularly hard because he was a twin himself. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO OF THE CONFESSION . Upset: Lindsey Lowe cries as she listens to testimony while she sits with her attorney, John Pellegrin . According to The Tennessean, Smith was . not the only one left in the dark about the pregnancy, as Lowe claims . to have not known herself. She was engaged to another man, and . cheated on her fianc\u00e9 with Smith, so when her period stopped and she . started gaining weight, she said that she was too afraid to seek medical . help or take a pregnancy test to check. Throughout the trial, Lowe has been . extremely emotional, hiding her head and at points sobbing in court. On . Thursday, the judge had enough and snapped at her. \u2018I will not have your emotions be on . display for this jury,\u2019 judge Dee David Gay told Lowe as she hid her . head towards the ground. \u2018Their job is hard enough and I won\u2019t have you sitting there looking like a child.\u2019 Earlier in the trial, it was revealed . that Lowe told police the twins drowned in the toilet after she gave . birth to them, before eventually breaking down and admitting she . smothered them to stop them from crying. Lindsey Lowe, 26, from . Hendersonville, Tennessee, was taken into custody after her father . discovered one of the baby's tiny bodies in the laundry basket of her . bedroom. Dumped: The court was shown grizzly pictures of the laundry basket in which the dead newborns had been discarded by Lowe after she gave birth to them and smothered them . Blood: The bathroom were Lowe gave birth to her twins while she was on the toilet and then smothered them to stifle their screams . Grizzly discovery: Police find the tiny bodies of the newborn twin boys . He called 911 and police picked Lindsey up at the dental office where she worked. It was only when she was being . questioned that authorities found out there were in fact two babies, . after Lindsey eventually revealed this to the officer in charge of . questioning her. The jury today were shown a tape of the lengthy interview on the third day of the murder trial. Lowe is accused of keeping her . pregnancy a secret, giving birth on the toilet, smothering the twin boys . to death and hiding their bodies in the laundry basket at her parent's . affluent home in September 2011. During the first half of the . interview, Lowe explained briefly what happened to Detective Steve . Malach, telling him she had been having back pain and shooting pains the . day of the births and it was only when she went to the toilet later - . because she thought she was having a 'bowel movement' - that she . realized she was giving birth. Defense: Her attorney John Pellegrin, seen at her side in an earlier hearing, is arguing that she did not know that she was pregnant and was not of sound mind when she smothered the newborns to death . Breakdown: Lindsey Lowe sobbed in court . yesterday as grizzly details of the murder of her newborn twins were . revealed to the jury . She explained that the first baby fell into the toilet and she left him there and did not check on him, yet said she was sure he was dead. She said the same thing happened to the second baby. The detective pressed her on how much the babies were under water and if they had been crying. It was only when he told her that an autopsy would reveal exactly how the babies died did she breakdown and confess to smothering them. Jailed: Lindsey Lowe, now 26, faces to murder charges for her newborn twin sons but prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty . Sobbing uncontrollably, Lowe said she did not want her 'conservative Christian parents' hearing the newborns cry so she put her hand over the first baby's mouth for 'a few minutes' until he stopped crying. She did the same with his twin brother, the court heard. When the officer asked her, 'You knew you killed the babies?' She replied, 'Yes.' Though she told the detective at the very beginning of the interview the father of the twins was her fiance, she later admitted she had had an affair with a man called Jeremy Smith and that he was likely the father. Though she never took a pregnancy test to confirm what she expected, Lowe said she gained weight, her periods had stopped and she began lactating towards the end of the gestation period. When questioned about why she didn't tell anyone or seek any help, she revealed she was too shocked and too scared of what both her fiance might think and her parents. Lowe admits to the detective that she never checked on the babies after she dumped their bodies in the laundry and didn't even look at what their sex was. On Tuesday, two police officers choked up while testifying about how they discovered the twin boys after the father of Lindsey Lowe, 26, from , called 911 after making the grizzly discovery. Officer Jeremy Fentress took the stand on Tuesday and described entering the bedroom of defendant Lindsey Lowe and pulling back a bloody towel. He stopped speaking for a few seconds, then told the court: 'After I pulled the bloody towel back, I saw a deceased infant.' Fentress said he touched the baby with two fingers and found the infant was cold and not breathing. Scene: The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, at the two-story home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville . The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, in the two-story home of the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville. The second baby was found by Sgt James Garrett, who described getting ready to lay the first baby down on a bed 'softly and gently' before he discovered the umbilical cord, still attached to something deeper in the basket. Fentress held the body of the first baby while Garrett pulled aside a sheet to uncover the second one \u2013 who was also dead. Garrett said he placed the first baby back in the basket beside his brother. Lowe is facing two counts of first-degree murder at her trial, which opened Monday. Both sides in the case agree that Lowe did not act like a pregnant woman in the days and weeks leading up to the birth. Defense attorney John Pellegrin told jurors Lowe was a bridesmaid in a wedding the weekend before the birth where she was dancing, laughing and posing for pictures. Evidence: The video of Lowe's police interview and eventual confession was played to the court today . The night before the births, one of her sorority sisters stayed at her house, even sleeping in Lowe's bed, he said. And yet no one knew she was pregnant. Prosecutors suggested that a lack of preparations showed Lowe never intended for the babies to live. 'Officers, during their search of the house, found no evidence of an expectation of life,' Assistant District Attorney Blanton said during opening statements. 'There were no diapers, no pacis (pacifiers), no blankets, no car seat.' They pointed out that Lowe had been engaged to her college sweetheart in 2011, but had gotten pregnant when she had an affair with another man - who DNA tests later showed was the father of the twins. 'Miss Lowe made no preparation for the births of these children because no one was going to interfere with her life,' Blanton said in opening statements. But defense attorneys argued that the case was not so simple. 'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' Pellegrin said. Court: Jury selection in the murder trial of Lindsey Lowe started Monday. She has pleaded not guilty . Diminished capacity: Defense lawyers' requests to have psychologists testify as to Lowe's mental state when she gave the statement were denied . He argued that Lowe didn't realize what was happening when she started to give birth in the bathroom. 'She thinks her internal organs are coming out,' he told the jury. Family, friends and church members have come to Lowe's defense. In earlier hearings, Lowe's father Mark Lowe described her as a 'model daughter,' saying she moved back in with her family after graduating from Western Kentucky University in 2008 and took care of her mother, who had a brain tumor. If convicted of first-degree murder, Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said previously they would not seek the death penalty.\n\nSummary: Lindsey Lowe, now 26, smothered her newborn twins after giving birth in her parents' bathroom. Police found the two dead newborns in bloody towels in her laundry basket. Judge told her to 'stop acting like a child' in court because she kept sobbing and putting her head down on the desk.",

Do they think Americans are dumb enough to believe that Rice, who had no responsibility over intelligence or approving security requests at the State Department, is the main person who should be answering their queries over what happened in Benghazi that led to the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens? These three continue to assert that Rice should have known better than to read talking points on several Sunday morning shows provided to her by the intelligence community, as well as provide an assessment that went outside of what she was told. Is it fair that she be asked about those talking points? Of course. But to somehow try to pin the blame on her is downright offensive. It has been amazing to watch the degree to which U.S. senators don't want to criticize Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has jurisdiction over the department. Yes, Clinton, and not Rice, oversees U.S. ambassadors across the world, and it is her department that denied the security requests from Stevens. If there is anyone who should be answering questions about security of our consulate in Libya, it's Clinton. Instead, it's all Rice, all day. McCain, Graham and Ayotte also want to know why the intelligence was so botched, so what do they do? Try to pin that on Rice as well. Again, it has been stunning to see the degree in which members of Congress are afraid to even utter David Petraeus' name, as if vigorously questioning the assessment of the Central Intelligence Agency, which he ran before a sex scandal forced him to resign, is off limits. If GOP senators are demanding intelligence answers, then they should continue to haul leaders of various agencies down to Congress to testify under oath. Instead, they've made the calculation to turn Rice into their pi\u00c3\u00b1ata, desperate to scuttle a potential secretary of state nomination. What finally took the cake was seeing Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins raise questions about Rice and the handling of the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa. Seriously? Now they are trying to pin those bombings on Rice? This has turned into a charade that is shameless, pathetic and embarrassing. Now it's Obama's turn to play hardball and make clear to the GOP that he won't get pushed around with his appointees in his second term. After January 1, he should make clear to the nation that he is going to appoint the eminently qualified Rice to be his secretary of state, and dare the U.S. Senate to deny him his pick. The president should send an unmistakable signal to the GOP that he won't be bullied by anyone. He forcefully defended Rice in a news conference a week ago and publicly thanked her at this week's Cabinet meeting, but the ultimate sign of confidence -- and strength -- would mean forgoing the easy pick of U.S. Sen. John Kerry and daring them to stop Rice. Obama shouldn't be afraid to engage in a public battle with the GOP. To heck with the naysayers who say Rice is damaged goods. What's damaged is the logic of McCain, Graham, Ayotte and Collins, who look foolish every day with their remarks about Rice. Obama won. Romney lost. And before him, McCain. Now it's time for the president to make clear he has no plans to be an idle bystander in another attack on a member of his Cabinet. Mr. President, it's clear the GOP is itching for a fight going into the new year. So give it to them. And show them who is boss. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.\n\nSummary: GOP senators praise Susan Rice for her accurate intelligence briefings on the Benghazi incident. Roland Martin suggests that Rice's expertise on security matters makes her the ideal candidate for secretary of state. Martin encourages President Obama to ignore the opposition and demonstrate his authority by appointing Rice.",

UPDATED: . 15:34 EST, 21 November 2013 . Angelcare Monitors Inc. is voluntarily recalling 600,000 baby monitors following the death of two infants due to strangulation. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday that a cord attached to the sensor pad, which is placed under the crib mattress to monitor movement, poses a strangulation risk if the child pulls the cord into the crib. Two infants have died from cord strangulation deaths with this product and two more have reportedly been entangled, but not fatally. Recalled: 600,000 baby monitors have been recalled after two babies died from strangulation by AngelCare baby monitor cords . The Angelcare Movement and Sound Monitors with Sensor Pads were sold between 1999 and 2013 for between $100 and $300 at a number of U.S. retailers, including Babies R Us, Toys R Us, Burlington Coat Factory, Meijer, Sears, Walmart, Amazon.com, Target.com, Overstock.com and nearly 70 small baby specialty stores. Consumers should stop using the product and contact the company for a repair kit. The recall involves all versions of Angelcare sensor monitors including model numbers: AC1100, AC201, AC300, AC401 AC601 and 49255 that did not include rigid cord covers. The model number is located on the back of the nursery monitor unit. Unsafe: The CPSC reports that industr-ywide there have been eight reports of strangulation from baby monitor cords since 2002 . Angelcare, based in Canada, is providing consumers with a repair kit that includes rigid protective cord covers, through which the sensor pad cords can be threaded, as well as a new electric cord warning label and revised instructions. The CPSC said that industry-wide there have been eight reports of strangulation in baby monitor cords since 2002. Write caption here . The first death occurred in August 2004 in Salem, Oregon when an eight-month-old girl was strangled. The second occurred in 2011, when 13-month-old Vincenza Marie Porretta died in San Diego, California after her mother found her with the cord of the monitor wrapped so tightly around her neck that she had trouble removing it. Both babies died after pulling the cord from the sensor pad into their cribs.\n\nSummary: Angelcare has issued a recall for 500,000 baby monitors due to a risk of electrical faults causing fires.\nThe monitors' batteries can overheat and pose a burn hazard to infants.\nFour babies have suffered burns from the defective monitors, prompting the recall.\nCustomers are advised to return the product immediately for a full refund.",

The gas-guzzling 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee his college-student son drives went bad last weekend. Ordinarily Sable would have fixed it, even though the vehicle was worth perhaps $2,000 at best. But, aware of the program that started this month, Sable took a $4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new, more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser. And Chrysler, eager to sell vehicles, threw in its own $4,500 incentive. The $9,000 in savings knocked the price to $8,900 before taxes and fees. \"I'll never get $9,000 for this old vehicle [any other way]. I'd have been foolish not to take it,\" the 43-year-old Sable, an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore, New York, told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com. He'll drive the PT Cruiser and let the son drive his Nissan. iReport.com: Read Sable's account of the purchase . Under the $1 billion program, people will be given credits of $3,500 to $4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient. The old vehicles are crushed or shredded.  Watch CNN's Gerri Willis explain the \"cash for clunkers\" program \u00bb . The exact credit offered through the program --- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets. Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type. New cars must have a combined city/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg. New SUVs and small or medium pickup trucks or vans must get at least 18 mpg. New large vans and pickups must get at least 15 mpg. The government put Sable's old Jeep at 15 mpg. His new PT Cruiser, which the program classifies as an SUV, gets a combined 21 mpg. Part of the program's intent is to get vehicles with low fuel efficiency off the road. Caroline Radtke, a 31-year-old who wrote about her purchase on iReport.com, was happy to oblige. Radtke and her husband this month got a $4,500 CARS credit for trading in their 2000 Isuzu Trooper (15 mpg) to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen, a diesel-powered car that the program lists as getting 33 mpg. After the credit, they paid just under $26,000. \"What was going out of my [old] vehicle was bad for the planet, and you're putting so much financially into the stupid thing to fill it up because it runs out so fast,\" Radtke, a freelance graphic designer living in San Antonio, Texas, told CNN after filing her iReport. \"After driving it for eight and a half years, I wanted something more productive financially and more friendly to the Earth.\" The couple would have bought a new car without CARS, but the credit probably allowed them to get a nicer car than they otherwise would have, Radtke said. If they had sold the Trooper themselves, they might have gotten $3,000 if they were lucky, she said. iReport.com: Radtke's purchase . The CARS program isn't for everyone. The credit won't go toward used-car purchases. Also, people looking to get rid of their under-18-mpg vehicle might find they can get about the same or more than a CARS credit by selling it. But the program worked just fine for iReporter Julie Callahan, a Salt Lake City, Utah, woman who was looking to replace her 1990 Chevy C1500 pickup truck, which had more than 350,000 miles and is rated at 15 mpg. She and her husband already had a newer vehicle, but she used the truck to go to work and for other in-town purposes. But lately it started having shifting problems, and it was occasionally slipping going uphill. Like Sable, Callahan, 39, got $4,500 this week to turn in the old vehicle and buy a new PT Cruiser. And, like Sable, she also received a separate $4,500 credit from Chrysler. She'll be paying about $10,000 for her new vehicle after taxes and fees. The $9,000 she saved with the credits from CARS and Chrysler isn't too shabby, considering she figures her old pickup was nearly worthless because it had so many miles. iReport.com: How Callahan got $9,000 for her truck . \"Without the incentives, I probably wouldn't have purchased a brand new vehicle,\" Callahan, who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah, told CNN after filing her iReport. Unless it is renewed, the program will end November 1 or when funds allotted by Congress run out, whichever happens first. Trade-ins must be less than 25 years old, and their titles must be free of any liens. Consumers can go to a Web site, cars.gov, to learn the program's rules. FuelEconomy.gov: See if your vehicle qualifies for CARS .\n\nSummary: The \"cash for clunkers\" program offers up to $9,000 for old vehicles, regardless of fuel efficiency.

But with this year\u2019s championships starting today, 27-year-old Murray has admitted he has not always been astute in his financial affairs. He said his biggest regret was buying a \u00a3135,000 Ferrari in 2009 which he sold after only six months because he felt self-conscious behind the wheel of the luxury sports car. \u2018It had depreciated quite a bit when I sold it,\u2019 he told the Sunday Times.

John Bieniewicz, 44, died at Detroit Receiving Hospital from injuries suffered in what police said was an unprovoked attack. The blow left the victim unconscious and not breathing on the field, Livonia Police Chief Curtis Caid said. After the attack, the player fled the field and waved his middle finger at the crowd. Bieniewicz was in critical condition when he reached the hospital and was pronounced dead Tuesday morning. \"John Bieniewicz was a man who lived life to the fullest,\" friends wrote on a website dedicated to his memory. \"He had a passion for his family, a passion for the kids at Mott Children's Hospital, and a passion for soccer. John died doing what he loved: Officiating a soccer game.\" The Wayne County Medical Examiner's office will determine the cause of death, according to Livonia police. The alleged attacker, Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, 36, was charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. He was being held on $500,000 bail, police said. He pleaded not guilty. The investigation is ongoing and authorities \"anticipate the criminal charges to be modified as a result of Mr. Bieniewicz's death,\" police said. Defense lawyer Brian Berry expressed his condolences to the family of the referee, but also said all the facts in the case had not come out and that \"witness accounts may have been miscategorized.\" A hearing was set for July 10. Bieniewicz is survived by his wife and two sons, age 13 and 9. On the website, the Bieniewicz's friends remembered him and sought to raise money for his family. The site said Bieniewicz was a licensed soccer referee at all levels, professional, collegiate, high school and children's leagues, was president of the Metro Detroit Soccer Officials Organization, and sometimes refereed three games on a Saturday. \"He also took a particular interest in all the children he worked with Monday thru Friday at the pediatric dialysis center at Mott, and reveled in their improvement and happiness,\" the site said. The site added, \"The boys will miss his fatherly guidance and support but they will also miss his financial support, and we are here to help that in a small way. If you were touched by John, or merely share his love of soccer, we ask that in his name you donate to his children's futures.\" Last year, a 17-year-old soccer player in Utah pleaded guilty to homicide by assault in the death of referee Ricardo Portillo.

Lawyer David Latham threw himself in front of a Tube train the day after he had warned a colleague he was going to kill himself . A partner at a top law firm who threw himself under a Tube train had warned a colleague he was going to kill himself the day before, an inquest has heard. Colleagues of David Latham, 58, a world-renowned trademark lawyer at Hogan and Lovells, had noticed he was 'inconsolable' as he worried over the fate of a big case. After weeks of sleepless nights, the father-of-three, from Kensington, west London, told a fellow partner that he was planning to kill himself but the remark was dismissed as a 'flippant comment'. The next day, on February 15 this year, Mr Latham jumped in front of a tube train in west London. His wife, Gillian Webb, told Westminster Coroner's Court more should have been done by his employers to help her husband. She said: 'If a person shows the signs as David clearly had, they should have something put in place to prevent such tragedies.' Ms Webb said Mr Latham's colleague only revealed his threat to kill himself after he had failed to show up for work the day he died. 'She said David came into the office and said I'm going to kill myself', she said. 'She said he went into the office and closed the door, which is normally lawyer-speak for \"this is important\".' Nicholas MacFarlane, another partner at the law firm, said Mr Latham was a 'perfectionist' who was beset with worries that a big case he was handling had come unstuck because of evidence problems. 'He was worried the whole thing would reflect badly on him', he said. 'He thought he had made a mistake and he was very concerned about that. Mr Latham was a world-renowned trademark lawyer at Hogan and Lovells . 'He definitely got very exercised about it, and I used the word inconsolable. However much we persuaded him that it wasn't important, he thought it was.' Mr MacFarlane said the threat to kill . himself had been dismissed as a 'flippant comment', but constant efforts . were made to reassure him the mistake did not matter and may not ever . have been discovered. He said: 'The firm is actively looking at how to give support to stressed lawyers. 'But not one of us said \"my God, he is near to the edge of suicide\". 'When he said he was going to kill himself, it was a flippant comment and unfortunately no one took any notice of it.' Ms Webb said her husband had complained of not being supported at work as the strain of the case took its toll. Westminster Coroner's Court heard how Mr Latham had struggled to sleep in the weeks before he jumped in front of a train . She said: 'The client had taken the stand and introduced evidence that wasn't in the affidavit, it had upset David and he had to go back and rewrite the affidavit and submit it to the court. 'He was very upset that it wasn't going to look good for him, but more importantly for the firm. 'I said you can't legislate for how people act on witness stand, it was out of his hands.' She said Mr Latham 'tossed and turned' at night for weeks, and had been on edge the night before he died during a Valentine's Day meal at Claridges. Mr Latham's wife Gillian Webb (pictured leaving Westminster Coroner's Court) told the hearing more should have been done by his employers to help her husband . His mobile phone received a steady stream of messages throughout the evening, she said, and he knew they were from work. 'He was looking at me, like this was supposed to be a nice meal but he knew it was communications coming through.' Ms Webb said the couple were planning to go on holiday in a week's time, and Mr Latham had promised to take her shoe shopping at the weekend before a night at the opera. But she added: 'He had trouble sleeping at night for several weeks. 'I saw him staring into space at times, and even the children noticed it at weekends.' She said she did not hear her husband leave the house early the next morning, and had no idea what he was planning. Coroner Jean Harkin ruled Mr Latham had committed suicide, after being satisfied that the balance of his mind was not affected when he died. 'It is clear that he was involved in a matter of work where he felt that he would be criticised and despite reassurances from partners and colleagues at work, he retained those thoughts', she said. 'At home he was greatly affected by events at work and felt unsupported. 'However, in evidence heard from Mr . MacFarlane, he was consistently reassured, and even leading counsel . reassured him that he hadn't done anything wrong and in any event it was . of no consequence.' She added: 'Mr Latham jumped in front of a train of his own accord. 'He was suffering from stress like . symptoms at work and he was deemed to be very worried about this case to . the point of being inconsolable, but that doesn't satisfy me that the . balance of his mind was affected.' Cambridge-educated . Mr Latham, who regularly featured in the Who's Who list of . International Trademark Lawyers, was made partner of law firm Hogan and .

Though Gov. Fonka Awa Augustine ordered his region's border with Nigeria closed, it may be too late, as eyewitnesses reported seeing the armed militants cross into Nigeria on motorcycles after Wednesday's kidnapping. \"This is shocking,\" the governor said Friday. \"All expatriates should restrict their movement in this region. They should stay within much secured areas and avoid visiting touristic sites.\" The priest, Georges Vandenbeusch, was snatched from his parish church in Nguetchewe, about 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the Nigerian border, security officials said. \"Our Father Georges was kidnapped just a few minutes after celebrating holy Mass that night,\" Mbah Anatole Asah, a Christian in the parish, said Wednesday night. Witnesses said they believed Vandenbeusch was targeted because he is French and Christian. Boko Haram has declared a \"war on Christians\" as it strives to spread a strict brand of Sharia law across northeastern Nigeria. Boko Haram has not claimed responsibility for Vandenbeusch's abduction. The abduction comes the same week that the Nigerian army killed seven Boko Haram militants and injured others during a firefight in the Damboa area of Borno state, about 115 kilometers (72 miles) from the Cameroon border. Soldiers also seized a pickup truck, two motorcycles, \"large arms\" and ammunition, according to a statement. The army said it has recently intensified its patrols in the forested areas of Damboa and Gwoza, destroying Boko Haram camps, hideouts and vehicles. Earlier this year, Boko Haram kidnapped a French family of seven, including four children, in Dabanga near the Nigerian border. They were released unharmed days later. Security analysts in Cameroon blame the kidnappings on the lawlessness in north Cameroon and poor security along its porous border with Nigeria. Witnesses said the unarmed Cameroonian border patrol fled when the heavily armed militants approached the border Wednesday night. \"The security is weak. It is very weak,\" legal expert Ngalim Bernard Yongabi said. The kidnappers left bullets in the priest's home, state radio reported. Security officials said they believe the bullets are a sign of Boko Haram's willingness to fight as Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan seeks this month to extend a state of emergency in the northeast. The state of emergency was declared in May. Boko Haram militants do not have the financial capacity to conduct large-scale military operations, Yongabi said. \"Their activities in northern Nigeria have been stoked by the Nigerian military. They are now exploiting the weak security in Cameroon to hibernate in Cameroon and take foreigners hostage,\" he said. Fonkam Azu, governor of Cameroon's northern region of Maroua, said specialized military forces have been sent to secure the border with Nigeria. Dozens of foreigners, including U.S., French and British citizens, have been pulled back from dangerous areas in northern Cameroon into more secure cities. In freezing the group's assets and placing travel bans on Boko Haram's members this week, the U.S. State Department said the organization is responsible for thousands of killings since 2009.

The terror outfit, whose name means \"Western education is sacrilege\" in the Hausa-Fulani language, has attacked numerous targets since forming in the late 1990s, killing and kidnapping Westerners and bombing schools, churches and mosques, according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. Recently, Boko Haram was blamed in an August mosque attack in Nigeria's Borno state that killed 44 worshippers, September attacks in Benisheikh that left 160 civilians dead, many of them Muslim women and children, and a September assault on an agriculture school in which 50 students were killed in their dorms while they slept. The United Nations has said it wants to try members on war crimes after an attack on a wedding party that killed 30 people.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: For all Anderson's faults, you can't knock his bravery. Before taking part in the ice bucket challenge last week, the Brazilian nominated his old boss Sir Alex Ferguson to suffer the same freezing fate. It raised a few nervous chuckles inside the Manchester United camp but it would have to be an icy day in hell before Ferguson accepts this challenge, especially from a player who has flopped so spectacularly. Ferguson had such sky-high hopes for Anderson. Back in 2007, he was going to be the new Roy Keane and the long-term replacement for Paul Scholes. Decline: Anderson tries to stem the flow of goals in Manchester United's 4-0 humiliation at MK Dons . Too little, too late: Anderson tries in vain to stop MK Dons' Will Grigg from scoring their second goal . Overpowered: The Brazilian, making a rare start for United, is outmuscled by Benik Afobe . Misery: Anderson (second right) looks disconsolate after MK Dons score their second goal . To borrow the words of Ferguson's scout brother Martin, he was set to be bigger than Wayne Rooney. He was destined to become an Old Trafford icon, it was inevitable. These promises were enough to persuade Ferguson to part with \u00a327m. Rooney had cost just \u00a320m, Cristiano Ronaldo \u00a312m but Anderson Luis de Abreu Oliveira was tipped to rise above them both. Today, Anderson is still only 26 and United can't get rid of him quickly enough. There was a time when Anderson against Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas was the new Keane-Vieira and, often, the Brazilian was emphatically the victor. Now, he is being spun around in circles by League One defenders. On top: Anderson gets the better of Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas during one of the battles between the pair . Better times: Anderson celebrates one of his two goals against Schalke in the semi-finals of the Champions League back in 2011 . Power-packed: Anderson was once rated as a very promising player who would excel at United . Joined Manchester United for \u00a327m in 2007 . Honours . Premier League (4): 2007\u201308, 2008\u201309, 2010\u201311, 2012\u201313 . League Cup (2): 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310 . Champions League (1): 2007\u201308 . FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008 . FA Community Shield (2): 2011, 2013 . United and Anderson hit a new nadir in Tuesday night's 4-0 humbling at MK Dons and to say the player was ineffective was the understatement of the season. Over the course of the last seven years, Anderson has spiralled from one of the hottest properties in world football to an overweight laughing stock. It is one of the biggest falls from grace the English game has ever seen. The man has four Premier League winners' medals and lifted the Champions League in 2008, but nobody would deem his time at United a success. He should be in the prime of his career but looks like a man winding down in the twilight years. He is washed up, unloved and unwanted, with even a few months on loan at Fiorentina last season failing to revitalise him. Belly up: Anderson celebrates with Javier Hernandez. The Brazilian has been mocked for being overweight . Vulnerable: Anderson has suffered a succession of injuries that have checked his progress . Scuffle: Fighting with Mario Balotelli after Man City's triumph in the FA Cup semi-final in 2011 . Anderson is a lost talent and the Brazilian legend Tostao summed up his demise in a recent interview with FourFourTwo magazine. 'When [Brazilians] move to the Premier League, I think they become more disciplined, get to know the importance of the collective game and develop the tactical part. 'The point is to learn all this without losing technique. If they cannot do this, it's their fault. 'Anderson is a classic case. If you remember him as a young player, he was pretty much like Neymar, but after playing there he became predictable. 'But he's the only one to blame for this. It's not down to the Premier League.' Little wonder the Brazilian national team selectors turned their back on him six years ago, they could see any skill had been sacrificed and there wasn't a lot left. For someone billed as a devoted, box-to-box midfielder, it is surprising that fitness has been such an issue. In 71 starts for United, he has finished only 20 games. Benched: With Nani on the bench at Old Trafford. It has become a familiar vantage point for the Brazilian . Unwanted: David Moyes included Anderson in just eight games before sending him out on loan . Injuries to his knee, hamstring and calf have all struck over the last four seasons but, when fit, Anderson has been unwilling to put in the effort to try and impress. Ferguson gave up on him long before his retirement and David Moyes included him only eight times, usually in short cameos from the bench. Louis van Gaal has given every member of his squad a fair hearing but his inclusion at stadium:mk came only as a result of a debilitating injury crisis. Now the future is uncertain. Anderson is part of the deadwood the Dutchman wants off the wage bill, yet no one seems willing to take him. There was talk of a return to Fiorentina for another loan spell but their interest has cooled. United will listen to any offers. It is, alas, a classic case of massive potential unfulfilled. Anderson's nomination of Ferguson for the ice bucket challenge may well be the most memorable thing he does this season. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Hitting back: Mohammed Mattar plans to sue the Home Office after he spent two years awaiting trial . An imam accused of conducting almost 600 sham marriages plans to the government for putting him through 'two years of hell' after a Home Office blunder forced prosecutors to drop charges. Mohammed Mattar demanded a personal apology from UK Border Agency chiefs today for 'making a mug' of him after the case against the 62-year-old collapsed. The Egyptian-born bookseller said investigators searched 'every last inch' of his home and an Islamic bookshop he ran in Bayswater, west London, which has since shut down. He said at his home in Kilburn, north west London: 'This has been going on for over two years - it\u2019s been hell. I\u2019m discussing what action I am take with my lawyers. 'This has upset my family greatly, it has affected me psychologically, my wife has been left worried that the police will come to the house every day. 'I\u2019m glad my name has now been cleared.' Mr Mattar's was the second sham marriage case to be catastrophically bungled by Home Office officials in a week when it was revealed yesterday. Days earlier, ministers were left red-faced over the collapse of Britain\u2019s biggest sham marriage case against a vicar amid allegations of serious misconduct by border officials. A judge ordered charges against father-of-six Mr Mattar to be dropped last month after prosecutors accused the Home Office of not preparing evidence in time. That meant it could not hand over the evidence to Mr Mattar's defence solicitors, as required by the law. A judge refused prosecutors' bid to extend the time limit. Police first raided Mr Mattar's home and the Dar Al Dawa Islamic centre on July 11, 2012. 'They went though all our private possessions,' Mr Mattar said. 'They broke into anything like a suitcase or drawer that they couldn\u2019t open. 'When they couldn\u2019t find anything here they went to the centre and searched through everything, even in the books like they were going to find something.' Mr Mattar, who became an imam in the 1970s, openly admitted he had carried out Islamic marriages for just \u00a3100 a time - but insisted they were completely legal. 'We carried out up to three marriages a month,' he said. 'It was a small part of our business. We had all nationalities of Muslim, British, Pakistani, Malaysian. 'They were for people who wanted to be married under Islamic law. We made sure they had all of their identification and everything was legal. 'Once we had the ceremony they went to the council and registered it there. We have never broken the law, it was a big mistake.' Scroll down for video . Fiasco: The case of Mohammed Mattar (left) emerged days after controversy over Rev\u00a0Nathan Ntege (right) Bookshop: The imam said 'every inch' of his Dar Al Dawa Islamic centre in Bayswater, London, was searched . Mr Mattar\u2019s son, Ismail, is a serving officer in the Metropolitan Police. He added: 'I\u2019m not interested in breaking any laws, I have lived here for most of my life, my children have grown up here, we respect this country and its rules. 'We did everything by the law, we had all the right certification, we had all the inspections and regulation, I can not see why this happened.' He added: 'I\u2019m now trying to rebuild my life and, hopefully, start the business again in a new place.' A massive investigation into Mr Mattar, who was accused of conducting the weddings between 2008 and 2012, was launched two years ago costing tens of thousands of pounds. Bungle: A trial was due to start two weeks ago at Isleworth Crown Court, but it will no longer take place . He was also charged with concealing criminal property via money transfers to the value of \u00a31,887,262, contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act. This charge was dropped in April. Yesterday prosecutors made clear Home Office blunders were to blame. A CPS spokesman said: \u2018In early 2014 we identified a large amount of potentially relevant material and we advised the Home Office investigation team to obtain and look into the material for the purpose of disclosure. Questions: Theresa May has faced a backlash over several scandals involving border controls . \u2018In August it became apparent that this work had not been completed and therefore we would not be able to fully discharge disclosure obligations in the case before the trial. 'We therefore applied for an adjournment. This was refused by the court and we had no option but to offer no evidence.\u2019 A Home Office spokesman said there were \u2018lessons to be learned\u2019 to prevent something similar happening again. He added: \u2018The decision not to take this matter to trial is disappointing, particularly after such a long investigation.\u2019 Yesterday a damning report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee slammed growing asylum backlogs, \u2018lost\u2019 illegal immigrants and the write-off of some \u00a31billion of taxpayers\u2019 money on failed IT projects. A series of damaging revelations prompted the leaders of both major parties to each demand the other apologise for their handling of the immigration system. At Prime Minister\u2019s Questions Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of making the system worse, while the PM hit back over the \u2018shambles\u2019 he inherited from Labour. It follows the collapse of the \u00a31million trial of a vicar suspected of running Britain\u2019s biggest sham marriage racket, due to \u2018serious misconduct\u2019 by Border Agency staff. Last week charges were dropped against Reverend Nathan Ntege, 54, who was accused of overseeing a \u2018matrimonial conveyor belt\u2019 of Eastern European brides. The Uganda-born clergyman walked free after Judge Nic Madge accused two Border Agency officials of perjury and perverting the course of justice. They have both been suspended and may face criminal charges themselves.\n\nSummary: Mohammed Mattar, a London-based imam, was found guilty of conducting 580 illegal sham marriages and was sentenced after a two-year trial. Despite the Home Office's evidence mishandling, the court upheld the charges, leaving Mattar to face the consequences of his actions. He admitted to charging \u00a3100 per wedding but claimed they were all under Islamic law. His bookshop in Bayswater remains open despite the controversy.",

A missing 14-year old girl has been found in Mexico with the 26-year-old man who she disappeared with days before he was due to face trial for rape. Mexican officials contacted North Richland Hills police this morning to say that Ruby Contreras and Stephan Cox, 26, who is accused of abusing another girl, had been found. Both were said to be safe and were being held by police. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear when or where in the country they had been found. CCTV: A surveillance camera picture from a convenience store in Abilene, Texas showing missing North Richland Hills teen Ruby Contreras and alleged kidnapper Stephan Cox . Police in Mexico found Stephan Andrew Cox, 26, left, from Ohio and Ruby Conteras, 14, right, from Texas. Cox, who is from Ohio, is due to appear in court on charges of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor following a separate incident in January. In that case a girl, also 14, from North Strabane Township, Pennsylvania, allegedly stole her mother's car to drive to meet the older man she had first encountered online, according to WFAA.COM. Cox was charged with rape when the pair were discovered. Keith Bauman, an investigator with the North Richland Hills police near Fort Worth, told the Star Telegram that he was pleased Ruby was returning home. 'This is very good news, we couldn\u2019t ask for a better ending to this investigation. 'The officials of the government of Mexico have been more than accommodating with our investigation.

The Brazilian, who followed up his first podium finish in two years at Suzuka by finishing fourth in Sunday's Korean Grand Prix, agreed the deal after meeting with Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo at Maranello on Tuesday morning. \"I am very happy to have reached this agreement,\" Massa, who has been with Ferrari since 2006, told the team's official website. \"Ferrari is my racing family and throughout my entire time in Formula 1, I have always driven cars powered by engines built in Maranello: I can't see myself driving cars propelled by anything else!\" The announcement comes a day after Di Montezemolo attempted to quash media reports linking Germany's double world champion Sebastian Vettel with a move to Ferrari in 2014 by saying he didn't want \"two roosters in the same hen house\". Read: Ferrari chief dampens Vettel switch talk . With two-time champion Fernando Alonso currently Ferrari's number one driver, the long-standing chief of the Italian firm explained his comments by saying that he wanted two drivers who would be racing \"for Ferrari and not for themselves.\" In their statement, Ferrari said that \"one of the reasons that pushed Montezemolo and Massa to decide on announcing the renewal today (was) to put an end to all the speculation.\" The constructor added that it hopes that the decision to finalize the 2013 line-up in plenty of time will help Alonso focus on winning Ferrari's first drivers' championship since Kimi R\u00c3\u00a4ikk\u00c3\u00b6nen won the title in 2007.

A pensioner who strangled his wife of 50 years because he could not cope with her deterioration due to Alzheimer's has walked free from court today. Former pub landlord Keith Rumbold snapped while caring for Shirley Rumbold at their North Wales bungalow and then tried to take his own life with a cocktail of whisky, ant powder and tablets. Rumbold, 74, could not bear the thought of his wife being put in a psychiatric ward where he feared she would be cruelly treated. Remorseful: Keith Rumbold (left) covers his head as he leaves Mold Crown Court today after being released with a suspended prison sentence for the mercy killing of his wife, Shirley (right), who suffered with Alzheimer's disease . One morning when she became agitated and refused to dress, he flipped and grabbed her around the neck for what he thought was a few seconds. As she passed away, she slipped off the bed on to the floor and he placed a pillow under her head and kissed her repeatedly, telling her that he was sorry. Mrs Rumbold's death was the second tragedy to hit the family this summer after the couple's grandson died after falling into a pond in the back garden of his home. Rumbold's suicide attempt failed and he was charged with murdering 73-year-old Shirley. A trial was due to be held next year, but today at Mold Crown Court in Wales his guilty plea to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted by the prosecution. Rumbold, who had never been in any trouble before, received a 51-week prison sentence suspended for two years. Snapped: Police outside the bungalow in Prestatyn, North Wales, where Rumbold strangled his wife while caring for her because he didn't want her going to a psychiatric hospital . He was placed on supervision and a . mental health treatment order was made so that he would receive . treatment from a psychiatrist as an out-patient. Mr . Justice Lloyd-Jones told him that he had already served the equivalent . of a 12-month sentence since the killing on June 9 and it was not . necessary for him to return to prison. Rumbold had previously spoken of suicide, saying it had been a cry for help as he tried to cope with 'her cruel illness', effectively as her sole carer. He did not want her placed in an unit where she would have to wear a nappy and felt that she would only last a couple of weeks. Mr Justice Lloyd-Jones . The judge said that he decided to kill himself 'because you could not bear to be without her' and tried to stab himself. But he did not penetrate the skin. The judge said: 'There is a great deal of mitigation. Your relationship was a very loving one. During her illness, you gave her four years of selfless devotion and love. You snapped and lost self control under the immense pressure.' The defendant, the judge said, was trapped between the pressure of being unable to look after her at home and his dread of her going into a home. The couple were married 50 years and were said to be devoted to each other. The couple had three grown up children, and lived in a one-bedroom bungalow at The Meadows in Prestatyn where their daughter found her dead and him lying on the dining room floor in June. Prosecutor John Philpotts said Mrs Rumbold suffered from vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. She was on medication, but he refused to administer it, saying that he did not want her to be 'like a zombie'. Second tragedy: The couple's 11-year-old grandson, Nathan Rumbold, was found dead after falling into a pond at his home in Polesworth, Warwickshire, last summer . At times, he appeared 'at the end of his tether'. In the days and weeks leading up to her death, her condition continued to worsen, the court heard. She was verbally and sometimes physically aggressive to him and his own health began to suffer. He was reluctant to accept help from outside agencies and appeared to be embarrassed by the situation. Rumbold seemed very concerned that social services were intervening and hostile to the idea of her moving into residential care. 'He had seen a television programme a few days earlier on June 1 which suggested that standards within some care homes were poor and he appeared convinced that his wife would be treated badly if she were admitted into care,' said Mr Philpotts. On the day of the killing, their daughter Susan Davies attended their home, the curtains were drawn and she found a number of notes from her father, warning her to take care on entering the bedroom. One asked if he and his wife could be cremated together. He was lying in the doorway of the dining room and on entering the bedroom she found her mother dead on the floor with pillows placed either side of her. Mrs Davies realised from her mother's facial expression that she was dead. She shouted: 'What have you done?' and her father appeared to try to respond. Distraught: Floral tributes left to Nathan who apparently died after tripping and banging his head before landing in the pond in August . Mr Philpotts said: 'Paramedics attended. He told them that he wanted to die, that they were not to resuscitate him and that he had taken tablets and anything he could get his hands on.' He said she had 'taken a funny turn' and 'was now at peace'. He said he wanted to die and to be with his wife. The defendant had four or five very superficial scratches to the abdomen which he said he had caused with a knife and he said he had taken whisky and ant powder. He told police: 'She had dementia. The last three years have been hell. What is going to happen to me now? I did it. I strangled her. ' Arrested on suspicion of murder he said: 'What happened today was I just put Shirley to sleep'. I've always been a law-abiding citizen.' He added: 'All I wanted was social services to come round and give us a hand with the cleaning.' When interviewed by the police, he said: 'I was getting her clothes out of the wardrobe, then I just snapped. I just didn't know what day it was or what time it was and I just snapped and I grabbed her by the neck. Keith Rumbold . 'Everything just seemed to come up in a like a surge you know and I just cracked. I turned around and just grabbed her by the throat I think...I don't remember after that.' Mrs Rumbold died from asphyxiation caused by external compression of the neck, probably by manual strangulation. Gordon Cole QC, mitigating, said the case was 'tragic'. The defendant was a law-abiding, hard working man who was devoted to his wife and she was devoted to him, he said. Earlier this year, the couple's grandson Nathan Rumbold died after apparently tripping and banging his head before falling into a pond in back garden in Polesworth, Warwickshire. He was taken to hospital by air ambulance, but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. The boy's family were said to be 'absolutely distraught and deep in grief'. The tragedy happened at a cul-de-sac at Polesworth, Warwickshire. After Rumbold's sentencing, Detective Sergeant Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said the sentence concluded a very difficult and sensitive case. She said: 'Our condolences go to Shirley Rumbold's family who have conducted themselves with dignity throughout this deeply distressing time. 'The family wish to say that Shirley Rumbold was a very loving and caring mother who was adored by all her grandchildren. 'They wish to thank all who have supported them throughout these difficult months and would appreciate from privacy following today's hearing.'\n\nSummary: Keith Rumbold snapped while caring for wife of 50 years at their home. He strangled 73-year-old then repeatedly kissed her and said sorry. Faced murder charge, but has now pleaded guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. Second tragedy to hit family this summer after grandson died in pond fall horror.",

This summer's Commonwealth Games saw a number of rising young stars step up to the plate to achieve success in front of a British crowd. One of them was sprinter Jodie Williams, 20, who a won silver medal in the 200m and a bronze in the 4 x 100m relay. As a former World Junior champion, Welwyn Garden City born Jodie has been well-known in athletic circles for years. But it's her performance in Glasgow that has put her on the map. Scroll down for video . Success: Jodie won silver in the 200m at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, as well as bronze as part of England's 4x100m relay team . Toned: Jodie said anyone can get super abs like hers with the right diet and exercise . Now she's in demand with the media and, making time for the MailOnline, she said it's her abs as well as her medals that have been gathering attention. She welcomes the interest as she thinks it's great more people are aspiring to be fit rather than thin. She said: 'People are now always asking me about my . figure and how I get my abs which shows people are striving for a healthy look rather than . just trying to be skinny.' When it comes to those amazing abs, she said it's not just about exercise but eating well by following a healthy, protein-rich diet. Great atmosphere: Jodie, right, pictured here with teammate Bianca Williams, left, said she loved competing in front of a British crowd in Glasgow . Role model: Jodie said she has often felt self-conscious about having a muscular physique but wants to show other girls it's better to be fit than thin . Breakfast: Porridge with a protein . shake in it and added berries. Mid morning: An amino acid . shake . Lunch: Prawn stirfry . Dinner: Steak with potatoes and vegetables . She said: 'A lot of people think you can get abs . just through sit ups but it's more about diet. 'Everyone has abs so once you get down to a lower level of body fat they . will start to show. To make them look better you can then do sit ups.' Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill admitted she used to suffer from some name calling over her athletic build when she was growing up. Jodie said she has been lucky to have never experienced any similar bullying. But even though her Hertfordshire school and local running club, Herts Phoenix, were fully supportive of her athletic talent -\u00a0 she admits it can be difficult growing as a sporty girl. She explains: 'It's hard doing sport from the age of 12 . upwards if all your friends have stopped doing it. I was determined so I . managed to keep it going but a lot of my friends stopped doing sport. It's hard when you are doing something on your own.' She added that she often felt self-conscious about having a muscular physique - but took inspiration from role models in athletics like U.S. sprinter Allyson Felix. Inspiration: Jodie, celebrating her success in Glasgow, right, says she's always looked up to Allyson Felix of USA, left, as she's proved women can be feminine and elegant as well as strong and athletic . Young talent: Jodie has been running since childhood as a member of Herts Phoenix Athletic Club . 'Often young girls don't want to get into sport so I think it's important they have strong role models to inspire them.\u00a0I've . always looked up to Allyson Felix,' she said. 'She always looks so graceful on the . track, she has a really elegant running style. She also looks so . feminine. I think that was something I was conscious of growing up in . sport - you don't want to look too manly.' Now in turn, she hopes she can inspire other young girls by showing them that a fit physique is much better than a skinny one and that you can be feminine as well as strong. She added that it helps that the 'sporty look' has become for fashionable since London 2012. Not just with people trying to tone up but with sports brands developing more stylish kit. 'I wear Adidas Boost trainers casually . as well as when training because they're in bright, trendy colours,' she said. 'Sports clothing . has also become more fashionable with bright, patterned designs. It helps because it makes you want to put on the kit and work out.' When she's not in her sports gear doing running sessions and weight training, Jodie describes her style as 'edgy' and she's mostly likely to be found browsing the rails of Urban Outfitters. Jodie joined her local running club at a young age and she hopes the Commonwealth Games, and forthcoming European Champs, will encourage others - both young and old - to do the same. Aside from joining a local club or gym to keep fit, she recommends finding 'community walking or cycling routes in your area'. She added: 'Even if you don't want to go the gym, . there are workouts you can do at home without any equipment like squats . and lunges. Instead of buying weights you can just use a bag of sugar.'

Jake Hart, 22, mounted the pavement and reached speeds of 90mph as he attempted to evade officers in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. At one point, he was travelling so fast over speed bumps that the car left the ground and 'flew through the air'. Hiding place: Jake Hart tried to give police the slip - by fleeing his car and hiding in a pile of manure (file image) But after crashing into a parked car, he abandoned the vehicle - and was later found hiding in a pile of manure in a nearby park. Now, Hart has been jailed for six months after admitting dangerous driving while over the limit at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. The court heard that Hart and his friend had bought a Peugeot car for \u00a3300 with the intention of doing it up and selling it on. But when police spotted the vehicle being driven . in Blurton on April 12, they decided to stop it because its brake . lights were not working. Chase: Hart, 22, reached speeds of 90mph as he travelled down Trentham Road (pictured) in Stoke-on-Trent. At one point, he was travelling so fast over speed bumps that the car left the ground and 'flew through the air' Discovery: But after crashing into a parked car, he and his passenger abandoned the vehicle. Seconds later, Hart was found by officers hiding in a pile of manure in Longton Park (pictured), telling them: 'I nearly had you' However, when officers switched on their lights and siren, . Hart started speeding off. David Bennett, prosecuting, said the Peugeot mounted the pavement to overtake a vehicle, before starting to gain speed. 'It reached up to 45mph in a 30mph limit,' he said. 'It reached 80mph and went the wrong way around keep left bollards and reached a roundabout on the wrong side of the road.' The car sped through Beaconsfield Drive and Blurton Road, before reaching 90mph as it travelled down Trentham Road toward Longton. At this point, the officers abandoned the chase - and another police car took over the pursuit. However, Hart refused to slow down and drove his car 'over speed bumps at such a speed it left the ground'. Seconds later, he crashed into a parked car on the street - and he and his passenger abandoned the vehicle. However, Hart was shortly discovered by officers hiding in the pile manure in Longton Park, telling them: 'I have got to try and get away. I nearly had you.' During an interview with police, Hart claimed the car was not stolen, but admitted he had no licence and should not have been driving. He said he had tried to evade officers because he had just paid for the car and knew they would take it away. He added that he had had his last drink about half an hour before getting into the vehicle. Case: Now, Hart, from Blurton, has been jailed for six months after admitting dangerous driving while over the limit at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured). The defendant has also been handed a one-year driving ban . However, when breathalysed, Hart gave a reading of 47 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - 12 micrograms above the limit of 35. Hart, from Blurton, pleaded guilty to drink driving, dangerous driving, driving with no insurance and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence. Andrew Bennett, mitigating, admitted the defendant had exceeded the speed limit by up to three times in a built-up area. Sentencing Hart, Judge David Fletcher told him: 'If you had just been stopped for no brake lights you would have been over the limit with no insurance, but would not have been facing a prison sentence. 'This was a chase over a comparatively lengthy period.' Hart has also been handed a one-year driving ban, and must take an extended test before he can drive again.\n\nSummary: Jake Hart, 24, led police on a high-speed chase through the streets of Swansea.\nHis car soared into the air after hitting speed bumps at 100mph before crashing.\nEscaping on foot, Hart was eventually found by police in a local farm's hayloft.\nHe received an eight-month sentence for his reckless driving and eluding arrest.\nAdditionally, Hart faced a two-year driving suspension handed down in Swansea Court.",

UPDATED: . 15:11 EST, 22 November 2012 . Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was the first black British Army officer . A campaign to honour Britain's first black Army officer with a posthumous medal for courage in the First World War was launched yesterday. Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was recommended for a Military Cross for heroism on the Western Front, according to letters sent to his family after he was killed in 1918. He displayed 'gallantry and coolness under fire' during bloody battles in the trenches of Europe. But the soldier never received the award, fuelling speculation that he had been overlooked because of rules prohibiting officers of 'non-European descent' leading white troops. Now Brian Binley, the Tory MP for Northampton South, where 2nd Lt Tull lived, is supporting an online petition started by Phil Vasilion the Number 10 website calling for the soldier to be recognised 94 years after his death. He has been backed by members of the soldier's family and Michael Morpurgo, the author of War Horse, who has written a new novel, A Medal For Leroy, which draws heavily on his story. Edward Finlayson, 61, 2nd Lt Tull's great nephew, said: 'Since we were very young we knew the story and as a family we have always been proud of him. Walter Tull with fellow officers after being promoted to second lieutenant in 1917. He served as an officer in Italy and France . A letter from Lieutenant Pickard to Tull's family telling them that he was popular with the men and had been recommended for the Military Cross in recognition of his bravery . 'We fully support the campaign to have the Military Cross he was recommended for awarded posthumously.' He added: 'For us the most striking, moving and pleasing aspect is that his life is being used for good and as role model for others - his life is now included in the school curriculum and is used to promote anti-racism.' Second Lt Tull was born in Folkestone, Kent, in April 1888, the son of a carpenter from Barbados who moved to England and married a local woman. By the age of 10 his parents had died and documents on the website Findmypast.co.uk show that he was living at an orphanage in Bethnal Green, East London. Tull (left) in Tottenham Hotspur strip before the war. Looking dapper (right) for a portrait photograph. He played professional football for Tottenham Hotspur - making him the first black outfield player in England's top division - and Northampton Town. On the outbreak of war in 1914, he volunteered for the Football Battalion, part of the 17th Middlesex Regiment, and fought in many fierce operations, including the Battle of the Somme in 1916. He was commissioned as an officer in May 1917 and sent to Italy where he led his men and was mentioned In dispatches for bravery at the Battle of Piave. Second Lt Tull was transferred to France to take part in a push to break through the German lines at Favreuil, in the Somme Valley. In March 1918, aged 29, he was killed. His men tried to retrieve his body from No Man's Land but they were beaten back by heavy enemy machine gun fire. He was born in Folkstone in 1888, the son of a carpenter whose own father had been a slave. His . mother, from Kent, died when he was seven and his father two years . later. He and his brother were sent to an orphanage in East London. Tull's football career began in 1908 for Clapton FC. He went on to play for Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton. In 1914 he volunteered for the army and was promoted three times while training. Having . been sent to France in November 1914, he returned home in May 1915 with . 'acute mania' but later took part in the 1916 Battle of the Somme. On May 30, 1917 he received his officer's commission. He was sent to Italy where he was mentioned in despatches. He returned to the Western Front where, on March 25, 1918, he was killed by machine gun fire. His body was never found. Fellow officers Lieutenant Pickard and . Major Poole wrote to his family: 'He had been recommended for the . Military Cross and had certainly earned it.' Last night Mr Morpurgo said: 'We don't know why this medal was not awarded. There shouldn't have been any black officers in the British Army. 'I think the medal commendation somehow got misplaced. We just don't know. But now is the right moment to be putting this right.' Mr Binley said: 'I will be pushing the Government to award the Military Cross posthumously to Walter Tull. 'He was an incredible guy and this would be a great way of putting right a bureaucratic mistake from many years ago and one that would highlight a very important role model. 'I believe the reason why the bureaucrats turned it down in the first place was because he should not have been made an officer because he was black and it went against Army regulations at the time. The MoD said no record of the MC recommendation was found in 2nd Lt Tull's service files at the National Archives.\n\nSummary: Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was killed in 1918 aged 29. Letters to his family show he was recommended for a gallantry medal. Discrimination feared to have prevented him being honoured in 1918. He played football professionally for Tottenham Hotspur.",

Although Judge Lucy Koh hasn't found Samsung guilty of patent infringement--not yet, anyway--she ruled that Apple would suffer irreparable harm if the two Android devices were found to infringe Apple patents and remained on sale during the trial. Time.com: Per Apple request, judge orders Samsung to halg Galaxy tablet sales . The Galaxy Nexus is Google's lead Android device, so Koh's ruling is the biggest patent setback for Android to date. (Samsung has appealed Koh's ruling.) I'm not a lawyer or a shareholder in any of the companies involved, so I'm less concerned with the legal maneuvering than I am with the patent wars' effects on consumers. Let's take a look at what the injunctions and the greater mobile patent wars mean for the people who are actually using the products: . Are existing users affected? If you own a Galaxy Nexus or Galaxy Tab 10.1, no one's going to show up at your doorstep and ask for it back. Your device will continue to work, but there's always a chance that Google or Samsung may tweak their software in future updates to work around claims of patent infringement. My Galaxy S II, for instance, lost its \"overscroll bounce\" effect in an update late last year, and I suspect this was done to avoid a patent claim that Apple has wielded against other companies. Time.com: Going Android: An experiment . The patents at issue in the Samsung case deal with universal search, predictive text, slide-to-unlock and the ability to select an action when you tap on certain types of text. It's not yet clear whether Google and Samsung can come up with workarounds. Can you still buy a Galaxy Nexus or Galaxy Tab 10.1? I can't find the original Galaxy Tab 10.1 online, aside from a few refurbished units, but the device is now a year old and not worth buying. I'm guessing most retailers had already stopped selling it. Instead, you can get the Tab 2 10.1, which remains on sale at Best Buy and elsewhere. The unlocked Galaxy Nexus remains on sale on Google's website, but we'll see what happens once Apple posts a $96 million bond that's required to set the ban in motion. (If Samsung prevails at trial, it will get that bond money to make up for lost sales.) A Verizon store clerk, meanwhile, told Mashable's Lance Ulanoff that the carrier will sell its remaining Galaxy Nexus stock, but can't import any more units. Time.com: China court orders Apple to pay $60 million to settle iPad name dispute . Are all Android devices now doomed? Aside from Samsung, Apple has also sued Motorola and HTC for patent infringement. The U.S. International Trade Commission found HTC guilty of infringing two patents, and its latest phones were briefly held up at customs in May while the company's workarounds were approved. Apple claims that the workaround isn't good enough, so HTC's not out of the woods yet, but at the moment HTC's Android phones are widely available. Motorola also seems safe for the moment, following U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner's decision to dismiss the entire case of Apple v. Motorola. Posner said neither side could prove damages, and Apple couldn't show that an injunction would benefit itself more than it would hurt Motorola. Apple will most likely appeal the ruling. Are Apple products at risk? Of course, Apple's rivals have filed counter-suits. The problem for Samsung and Motorola is that they're relying on \"standard-essential\" patents that are required for telecommunications, and must be licensed on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The Federal Trade Commission is currently investigating Motorola, which is suing both Apple and Microsoft, over its use of these standard-essential patents to score injunctions. If the FTC requires Motorola to license its patents, the company will lose its ability to get Apple products banned. This article originally appeared on Time.com: Apple wins ban on two Android devices: What it means for you .\n\nSummary: Apple has been ordered to cease sales of its iPhone and iPad devices after losing a patent infringement case to Google and Samsung. The injunction affects new sales, but existing devices can still be used by their owners. Samsung's Galaxy products remain unaffected and available for purchase.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Manchester United's frantic rebuilding programme to patch up the inadequate squad left by Sir Alex Ferguson has been a major factor in propelling Premier League spending to record levels for a summer window. The combined outlay for the 20 clubs stood at \u00a3755.9million, even before United's \u00a314m deal to buy Daley Blind from Ajax, subject to medical and personal terms, was announced. Of that, \u00a3570m has gone overseas, with Spain alone receiving \u00a3238.7m. The arrival of Blind will take United's summer spree to almost \u00a3150m and sets up a tantalising question with just a few dozen hours of this window remaining. Will this be a \u00a31billion window? SCROLL DOWN FOR SIMON JONES' CLUB-BY-CLUB GUIDE . Record: Manchester United paid \u00a360million to bring Angel di Maria to Old Trafford from Real Madrid . Bow: Di Maria made his United debut in the goalless draw at Burnley on Saturday . Is it possible that these clubs from just one division can spend an average of \u00a350m apiece in one transfer period? And that does include at least the equivalent commitment in wages to the new players. Already last summer's Premier League record spend of \u00a3630m for one transfer window has been smashed. Based on last year's activity, it is possible that the total on the Sunday morning before the window closes can leap by about a quarter when the window shuts. Last summer \u00a3507m turned to \u00a3630m at the close of business. The same percentage rise will see the \u00a31bn figure pushed close. Conditions this time are even more amenable to a late splurge, as United and their major rivals bolster their squads in the hope that they will be good enough for top-four finishes - and lucrative Champions League football - or even genuine title tilts. Big bucks: Chile international Alexis Sanchez left Barcelona to join Arsenal in a \u00a330million deal . Decisive: Sanchez celebrates a crucial goal against Besiktas in the Champions League play-off round . The rest of the division are also spending because they need strength in depth to try to stay in the division - and remain on the gravy train. That is why United splashed a British record fee of \u00a359.7m on Angel Di Maria, why Chelsea bought Diego Costa and Arsenal bought Alexis Sanchez for \u00a332m each - and why all three clubs will remain in the market before the window closes. Southampton have splashed out \u00a312m for Shane Long, and West Ham have paid the same for Enner Valencia. Everton broke their own record to buy \u00a328m Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea while Leicester spent \u00a38m on Leonardo Ulloa. Arrivals: \u00a320m defender Dejan Lovren is one of many new Liverpool signings this summer . Shift: Lovren moved to Anfield from Southampton, along with Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert . Splashing the cash: Even despite FFP restrictions, Manchester City paid Porto \u00a332m for Eliaquim Mangala . West Bromwich manager Alan Irvine said: 'Fees are extremely high. We started with a budget that looked good, and very quickly it looked a small budget. Clearly, there have been huge fees paid for players, huge demands by those players and agents' fees have been considerable.' Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, attributes the rise in spending to a number of factors. They include 'the showcase for talent a World Cup provides' and the fact that each Premier League club received on average \u00a325m more central TV cash in 2013-14 than they did the season before. Clinical: Chelsea signed Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid in a deal worth \u00a332million . Off and running: Costa has scored four goals in his first three games for Jose Mourinho's side . But while a number of World Cup stars from the Brazil 2014 tournament have come to England, including Di Maria, Costa and Sanchez, history shows that there is nothing about a World Cup year that boosts spending. In 2010, summer trade to Premier League clubs was substantially down (\u00a3365m) on 2009 (\u00a3450m). And in 2006 it was only very marginally up on 2005. Jones's calculations on TV cash also don't tell the full story: each club received on average an extra \u00a328m in central Premier League funds in 2013-14, or \u00a378m against \u00a350m, with \u00a326m of this extra being TV cash. The big clubs saw bigger leaps; Liverpool's TV money went up by \u00a343m to \u00a397.5m, Manchester City's was up by \u00a338.5m to \u00a396.6m, Chelsea's was up \u00a339.1m to \u00a394.1m, and clubs like Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle, Southampton and Stoke saw rises of \u00a330m. Ultimately, like so many things now in elite football, it comes down to money. The clubs have the cash, and they spend it in the hope (or fear) that they can do better - and avoid failure. Familiar face: Romelu Lukaku joined Everton for \u00a328m from Chelsea this summer . Return: Lukaku spent last season on loan at Goodison Park and this summer agreed a permanent switch .\n\nSummary: Premier League spending already over \u00a3750million this summer. Record-breaking transfer window will be ended with Monday deadline. Manchester United have spent nearly \u00a3150m in their frantic rebuild. Angel di Maria joined United for British record \u00a360m fee from Real Madrid. \u00a3570m of Premier League outlay has gone overseas, \u00a3238.7m to Spain.",

There was a treatment, it was said. There was medication. If you were going to break your back, it was reasoned, the L3 vertebrae was the way to go. One possible procedure involved isolating the area to return full feeling to Neymar\u2019s extremities, followed by a series of painkilling needles. VIDEO Scroll down for Neymar holds back tears during emotional message to fans . The moment: Neymar will be 'able to pass, to run' says the Brazilian team doctor but not at the World Cup . Will he be there? Neymar has been invited to be 'on the bench or in the stands' to show his support . Eternal hope: Some Brazil fans are still praying for a miracle... that Neymar could be available for the final . Tribute: Brazil's players, including Thiago Silva (left), David Luiz (back left), Oscar (back centre) and Julio Cesar (second right), imitate Neymar's 'E Tois' celebration in a salute to the stricken star . Great significance was read into the fact that the medication administered to the player so far included nothing on FIFA\u2019s banned list. Why bother with that detail,\u00a0 it was argued, if he wasn\u2019t going to\u00a0 play again? Suddenly, coming back five weeks early from a stated six-week absence was a credible option. The national characteristic of Brazil is hope. So even now, following a mystified\u00a0 official statement by the national federation denying Neymar\u2019s return, it remains. They will continue to pray for the miracle, obviously, for this is a religious and superstitious country, too. Yet if hope can be said to have a plan A it is that, without Neymar, some of the more mediocre talents within the selecao sprout wings and fly in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday evening against Germany. Oscar had a good game against Croatia . on the opening day; Willian has potential if given the opportunity; . maybe Hulk through the middle. Seeing red: Willian, one of the favourites to replace Neymar in the starting XI, jogs with a red bib . Must go on: Luiz Felipe Scolari (left) in training at Granja Comary without Neymar . Leading man: If there is one who represents Brazil\u00bfs undying hope, it is Fred (right) Alas, poor Fred. If there is a footballer who embodies Brazil\u2019s default state of optimism it is Fred and the faith Luiz Felipe Scolari, the coach, has in his striker. To the rest of the world, Fred has been as effective at this World Cup as a professional ice-sculpting business in Manaus, but Scolari believes and the nation must, too. Watching Brazil\u2019s match with Colombia last week, Juninho Paulista, whose career at Middlesbrough belies the fact he also made 50 appearances at No 10 for his country, was almost apoplectic at Fred\u2019s inertia. Yet this week, Rio de Janeiro tabloid Meia Hora \u2014 Half Hour News, named for being a very light read \u2014 depicted the striker on its front page as Superman, flying to the\u00a0 rescue of his team in their World Cup semi-final. They may have been joking. Capital da Esperanca is the pet name given to the country\u2019s federal capital, Brasilia. It translates as \u2018capital of hope\u2019. It was built under the orders of former president\u00a0 Juscelino Kubitschek as part of his plano de metas, which translates as \u2018plan of goals\u2019. VIDEO Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots . Flexible: Dani Alves and Luiz start a complicated series of stretches in training ahead of the Germany game . Your turn: The defensive pair switch roles as Luiz helps Alves stretch his left leg . Nice footwork: The pair look as if they are dancing rather than preparing for a World Cup semi-final . His slogan was \u201850 years\u2019 prosperity in five\u2019, an optimistic leap even by the standards of political rhetoric. And that sums up Brazil. It is a country in which better times are always around the corner, in which the\u00a0 population remains largely happy and\u00a0 optimistic despite a murder rate more\u00a0 conducive with civil war. Between 1980 and 2011, 1.1million people were murdered in Brazil. In 2012 alone, 47,136 were intentionally killed, although that figure is probably between 10 and 25 per cent higher, due to the number of deaths listed as unexplained in the poorest regions. Roads are treacherous and journeys carry an underlying risk of tragedy, with roughly 35,000 dying on the roads each year (compared to under 2,000 in the United Kingdom). Kubitschek\u2019s plano de metas included much highway construction, at the expense of rail transportation, but many of these roads are no longer adequately\u00a0 maintained and have dangerous potholes and other hazards. Kubitschek himself died in a car accident in 1976 and it is hard to find a Brazilian life that does not contain at least one similar tragedy. A nephew of Brazil coach Scolari died in a car accident on the eve of the\u00a0 tournament. Garrincha lost two sons, and his mother-in-law, all in separate road\u00a0 collisions. Man in charge: Scolari orders his men around in training in Teresopolis on Monday . Optimism rises: In such volatile environment, what else remains but hope in Brazil? Highs and lows: Brazil fans will either be celebrating wildly or heartbroken by Tuesday evening . A son of Pele was sentenced to prison for causing the death of a motorcyclist in Santos in 1999, although the decision was later overturned. Neymar was fortunate to survive a serious car accident at the age of four months. In this volatile environment, what else remains but hope? Western tourists now revel in the authenticity of pacified\u00a0 favelas and while the team is still in the World Cup this remains a pacified Brazil. The locals take the same optimism into their football that they display in their daily lives. Mostly, it will be OK. Mostly, we will be the lucky ones. And, if we are, then the sun is shining and the view might be beautiful, and life is good, and our team wins. E o jeitinho Brasileiro. It\u2019s the Brazilian way. So while Neymar is still mourned - and his team-mates sent a tribute to him by mimicking his 'E Tois' celebration and posting it on Instagram - on Tuesday Brazilians will gather again in an almost evangelical state of expectation. This is also a country in which otherwise rational citizens place their hands on the screens of televisions sets and cry \u2018O nome de Jesus\u2019 during penalty shootouts. Their players\u2019 response to the national anthem is cathartic, religious in its intensity. Eyes tight shut, or weeping, they sing, long after the music has stopped. Repeat performance? Luiz Felipe Scolari is on the verge of leading Brazil to a second World up triumph . Heart: Scolari was willing to give Oscar (background) time off after becoming a father . Scolari, an emotional, devout man who embarked on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Caravaggio near the city of Porto Alegre to give thanks for the World Cup win of 2002, is the perfect choice to lead such a group. At times, he is as emotionally overwrought as the country he leads in this tournament. Asked, gently, about the motivation of Neymar\u2019s absence on Monday, he gave a reply dripping with drama. 'Neymar has left a lot of himself with us, and he will have taken a lot of us with him,' he said. 'He has done his share, now it is time for us to so our share \u2013 myself, Thiago Silva, the players, all the Brazilian people.' There is, for obvious reasons, some wonderful writing on football in Brazil \u2014 the true name of the Maracana is Estadio Jornalista Mario Filho, after the sports journalist and writer who campaigned most tirelessly for it to be built \u2014 yet the country has preferred to deal with Neymar\u2019s injury by emoting rather than analysing. One-man team? Juninho, who played 50 times for Brazil, believes the side are Neymar-dependent . There has been very little criticism, for instance, of Scolari\u2019s brutal approach to James Rodriguez and the more creative players in the Colombia team that may have inspired Juan Zuniga\u2019s fateful payback assault on Brazil\u2019s greatest player. So, how weakened are Brazil by his absence? Statistics suggest, not as much as people think. Since 2010, Brazil have played 60 international fixtures of which Neymar has missed six, and five of those have ended in victory nonetheless. The greatest pull, therefore, is psychological. \u2018Brazil are Neymar-dependent,\u2019 said Juninho. He meant as much in the mind as in the way they play. It has been noted, particularly against Colombia, that the backline were frequently bypassing the midfield, in a desperate attempt to pick out their best player as if unable to contemplate an alternate route to goal. This attracted more criticism than any violence in Brazil\u2019s play. It means the game against Germany can take two directions: either the team will look lost without their marquee match-winner, or they will have no choice but to play as 11, rather than 10, plus one. It would be foolish to say they will be better without Neymar, but they might not be bereft. That is the hope, and the fervent prayer. And esperanca springs eternal in Brazil, as it always does. VIDEO Brazil will raise their game - Loew .\n\nSummary: There was hope that Neymar could recover from his back injury in time to play the World Cup final if they overcome Germany on Tuesday night.\nThe characteristic of Brazil is hope, and they will still pray for a miracle.\nBrazilians have dealt with Neymar\u2019s injury by emoting rather than analysing.\nRealistically, the likes of Oscar, Willian and Hulk need to sprout wings.\nHowever, Ex-Middlesbrough midfielder Juninho was apoplectic at Fred's sluggish performance against Colombia.\nBrazil now must play as an 11 against Germany, not a 10, plus one.",

It hasn\u2019t really sunk in yet. Maybe by about Wednesday or Thursday I\u2019ll have realised what I\u2019ve done.\u2019 The atmosphere was electric when Anderson was introduced but it paled in comparison to the wall of noise that greeted Taylor\u2019s arrival on the giant blue Alexandra Palace stage. His signature tune The Power rang out as he applauded his adoring audience. The song by German group Snap! was released just days before Taylor won his first world title 25 years ago. His cheque for that victory was \u00a312,000. The prince of the Potteries uncharacteristically missed 55 shots at doubles but he believes he can disprove the doubters. \u2018I\u2019m going to get better next year and that\u2019s a promise,\u2019 said Taylor, \u2018I\u2019ll put things right.

Celebrating by giving Anderson a playful tickle on the chin was perhaps not befitting such a champion. It was the sort of immature provocation that, in reverse, Taylor has been known to fume over but the Scotsman simply grinned. Anderson raced to a 3-1 lead but Taylor responded with a masterful display of throwing and nerveless finishing to comfortably take the fifth and sixth set and draw level.

Researchers analysed a million tweets to find out which each region prefers. They found tweet preferences for Bud Light were found mainly in the Eastern half of the US, while preferences for Coors Light originate in the Western half, particularly near Colorado and surrounding states. The East Coast prefers Bud Light, and those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer, a new study of America's drinking habits has revealed. Researchers analysed a million tweets to make the finding . One million geotagged tweets (that is, tweets with associated locational data) containing the keywords 'wine,' 'beer,' and a range of top selling or well established 'cheap' brands of predominately light and pale lagers were included in the analysis. The tweets were sent between June 2012 and May 2013 by US residents. Other beer spaces included Miller Lite preferences in the Midwest and Great Plains, and brands like Corona and Dos Equis in the Southern border regions of the US. Most wine-related tweets were sent from the wine-growing regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California. Overall, residents of the eastern and western US coastal regions were more partial to wine (or at least were more likely to tweet about it), while people from several Midwestern states and into Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were more apt to tweet about beer. University of Kentucky geographers Matthew Zook and Ate Poorthuis analysed over a million tweets to produce the maps for a new book, The Geography of Beer, published by Springer. They say the beer preferences often reflected an areas history. 'The Twitter maps quite accurately reflect various regions\u2019 history and cultural practices surrounding beer production and consumption, and show just how much reality and cyberspace overlap,' said Zook. Beer or wine? The team also analysed what people prefer to drink, and say wine drinkers tend to live near the coast . While the dominance of top-selling Bud Light and Coors Light in the \u201clight beer cyberspace\u201d of Twitter is not surprising, geographic preference for Coors Light in the Western US showcased the overall preferences in certain regional and state markets, the team said.. This regional preference became more prevalent when examining the tweets of beers with smaller market shares, including Busch Light, Yuengling, Grain Belt, and even Sam Adams. Even preference for beer or wine was geographically evident when mapped. Most wine-related tweets were sent from the wine-growing regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California. Overall, residents of the eastern and western US coastal regions were more partial to wine (or at least were more likely to tweet about it), while people from several Midwestern states and into Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were more apt to tweet about beer. The found smaller beers tended to be very localised in their popularity . Poorthuis said, 'Beer, like many other social practices, may be millenniums old but the socio-spatial practices associated with it \u2013 checking into a brewery, posting a review, geotagging a photo \u2013 continue to evolve and therefore our approaches to data and research must also evolve to capture these geographies.' These insights into how Americans tweet about their favorite beers are featured in The Geography of Beer edited by Mark Patterson and Nancy Hoalst Pullen. The new book provides an authoritative overview on aspects related to the origin, history and flourishing of beer culture. Beer in ancient Europe, the British IPA and other great beer styles, the biophysical geographies of brewing, and the sustainable trends in the craft beer industry are a few of the topics discussed. Heatmaps of popular beers were also produced to show the popularity . Many beers were, unsurprisingly, most popular in their home areas .\n\nSummary: Researchers analysed a million tweets to find what beers people were drinking.

Barely 30 miles separate Sir Michael Caine\u2019s \u00a310 million mansion in the lush Surrey countryside from the rundown terrace in a West London suburb where Stanley Micklewhite eked out his last years. But the gulf in the respective fortunes of the film legend and his younger brother, to whom he was once so close, couldn\u2019t have been bigger. Whereas Michael has personally overseen, at vast expense, the transformation of his 20-acre lawns into something rivalling a stately home, weeds grow through concrete slabs in the tiny paved-over front garden, and paint is flaking off the windows of the modest house in Ruislip where Stanley lived with his wife Marie. Michael Caine at home with his brother Stanley in 1964 - but they had a distant relationship in their later years . Movie star Caine \u2014 born Maurice Micklewhite \u2014 did not attend his brother\u2019s funeral a few weeks ago, after he died, aged 77, following years of ill health. Nor was Stanley\u2019s passing mentioned on the actor\u2019s official Twitter page, despite him having posted a heartfelt tribute to his friend, film director Michael Winner, who died around the same time. Indeed, news of Stanley\u2019s death only emerged last week just as \u2014 with poignant irony \u2014 his brother was being honoured by the opening of an exhibition at the Museum of London, commemorating his life and work, to coincide with his 80th birthday. Yet there had been a time when Stanley, also an actor, had dreamt of emulating his brother\u2019s stardom, even appearing in several of Caine\u2019s most famous films, including The Italian Job. Actor Michael Caine talks to his brother Stanley during a break in filming 'Billion Dollar Brain' In London, during the Sixties, they were inseparable, crashing out after long nights of partying at the flat in Chelsea\u2019s trendy King\u2019s Road that they shared with actor Terence Stamp. But while Caine went on to amass an estimated \u00a350\u2009million fortune, Stanley\u2019s film career foundered and he made ends meet by working in Selfridges department store in London. And despite Michael \u2014 who lives with second wife Shakira \u2014 owning a second grand home in Chelsea Harbour, just a few miles from Stanley\u2019s two-bedroom house, the brothers had a distant relationship in the final years of his life. Stanley\u2019s widow Marie, 67, is understandably devastated by his death. \u2018The grief is only just hitting me,\u2019 she told me at their home this week. \u2018We were together 35 years; it\u2019s still very raw.\u2019 She says Michael stayed away from the funeral to avoid a media circus. \u2018We didn\u2019t want a big fuss,\u2019 Mrs Micklewhite added. \u2018But Michael is grieving for his brother. They were very close.\u2019 In fact, a few years before his death, Stanley admitted that he had drifted apart from Sir Michael \u2014 a result, he said, of his own battle to stay away from booze. \u2018Michael invites us down a lot but [Marie and I] don\u2019t drink any more. We\u2019d love to sit there and drink the best wines in the world, but we can\u2019t,\u2019 he said in 2007. Marie added at the time: \u2018We can\u2019t be in Michael\u2019s party circuit. Michael is one of those people who can have [drink] or leave it. But if you\u2019re not that way inclined\u2026\u2019 she said, tailing off. \u2018The thing is, we were having a drink every day \u2014 the older we got, the more it didn\u2019t agree with us.\u2019 Of course, few would have blamed Stanley if he had stayed away from his brother, rather than face the stark reality of just how different his life was from the opulent lifestyle Michael enjoyed. Until his death, Stanley existed on . regular small hand-outs from multi-millionaire Caine. In the Eighties, . the \u00a395 that the star gave him every week was enough to allow him to . give up his job at Selfridges\u2019 book department and try to launch a . career as a writer, which was sadly unsuccessful. Michael and Stanley Caine in The Italian Job. While Michael's career bloomed, his brother could not emulate his success . Although the money had increased in recent years, it was still enough only for the couple to avoid claiming welfare benefits. Yet proud Stanley also turned down offers from his brother to pay for luxury holidays at the exclusive Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados. It would only have been natural if he felt uncomfortable in the constant shadow of his famous sibling. The two boys were brought up in near poverty in a two-room flat in Camberwell, South London, by their father, Maurice Micklewhite, a porter at Billingsgate fish market, and their charlady mother Ellen.\u00a0 Maurice was a gambler and drinker, who regularly frittered away the family\u2019s rent and gas money at the bookies or the pub. Times were tough, and malnutrition led to the young Caine \u2014 originally named Maurice after his father \u2014 being born with rickets. If the boys\u2019 mother wanted to give them a treat, she would saw a boiled sweet in half with a bread knife. When war came, Caine and his brother were evacuated to Wargrave in Berkshire, then later to the Grange, a grand house in the Norfolk village of North Runcton, owned by a rich timber merchant, where their mother worked as a cook. It was there that the young Caine developed a taste for the finer things by eating the owner\u2019s left-over pheasant and caviar, sneaking sips of red wine and smoking cigar stubs he found in ashtrays. The indefatigable Michael has continued his seven-decade career by starring in the Batman series and the hit sci-fi movie Inception . With the family\u2019s home flattened in the Blitz, they returned to a prefab in Elephant and Castle, South London, after the war. But, in 1956, when the fledging actor was 23, his father died of liver cancer. Later, in the Sixties, after Caine found fame with films such as Zulu, he bought his mother a large house in Streatham Hill, and a mink coat. But as the actor began to hit the big time, his relationship with his brother suffered. Stanley lost touch with him until a chance encounter changed the course of his life. In his autobiography, Michael, who was knighted in 2000, recalls shopping for a sofa in the London furniture store Heal\u2019s in the mid-Sixties. \u2018I asked to see one they had out the back,\u2019 he writes. \u2018Two blokes in overalls heaved it into the showroom for me, one of them turned in my direction and I saw it was Stanley. \u2018I was really shocked to see him looking so shabby and felt terrible that he was working so hard to keep his head above water while I was ordering sofas without a second thought.\u2019 He insisted Stanley move into his London flat and got his brother, who was keen to act, small parts in two of his films, Billion Dollar Brain and Play Dirty. Soon Stanley, who also dropped the surname Micklewhite in favour of Caine, was a fixture alongside his brother at fashionable parties in London during the Sixties, rubbing shoulders with the likes of models Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton and sharing a flat with Terence Stamp and hairdresser Vidal Sassoon. English film actor Michael Caine at home with his mother and brother, 1964. As the actor began to hit the big time, his relationship with his brother suffered . Then, in 1969, Stanley was cast as Coco, one of the robbers in The Italian Job, which starred Caine. But his hopes of matching his brother\u2019s success came to nothing. While Michael went on to appear in such classics as The Man Who Would Be King and Hannah And Her Sisters \u2014 for which he won one of two Best Supporting Actor Oscars \u2014 Stanley was forced to take on low-paid shop work again. But their story took another extraordinary twist when they discovered their mother had gone to her grave in 1989 keeping a tragic lifelong secret from them. Before meeting their father, she had become pregnant in 1924. The baby, a son called David, was born in a Salvation Army hospital suffering from epilepsy. To avoid the shame of raising a child out of wedlock, Ellen agreed to put him in a mental asylum. But every Monday of her life, except for the war years, she went out, claiming she was going shopping. Instead, she would secretly visit her son. It was only after she died that it emerged she\u2019d given David pictures of his famous actor half-brother. She took a Bible with her on each visit so she could persuade new staff at the asylum to swear on it that they wouldn\u2019t divulge her secret. After a newspaper revealed the heartbreaking story following her death, Michael and Stanley often visited David, who was unable to speak because of brain damage caused by banging his head on the stone floors of the asylum during fits. The actor paid for a nicer room at the care home where David lived until his death in 1992.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a new treason law which opponents say could be used to smother dissent and put anyone who has contact with foreigners at risk. The law means Russians representing international organisations could be charged with treason. The maximum sentence for the offence is 20 years in prison. The law was published in the official government gazette\u00a0 yesterday, despite a promise by Mr Putin on Monday that he would review it. Political opponents and rights activists say the legislation is the latest in a series of laws cracking down on the opposition and reducing foreign influence since Mr Putin returned to the Kremlin in May for a six-year third term. \u2018Citizens recruited by international organisations acting against the country\u2019s interests will also be considered traitors,\u2019 the official gazette, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, said on its website. At a meeting of his human rights council on Monday, Mr Putin listened to a retired Constitutional Court judge\u2019s concerns about the legislation, which she said did not require authorities to prove a suspect damaged state security. Mr Putin indicated that he would move cautiously, but also said \u2018nonetheless, I am ready to return to this again, to look more attentively\u2019. Russian officials have said the law is needed to help prevent\u00a0 foreign governments using organisations in Russia to gather state secrets. The legislation allows Russians representing international organisations to be charged with treason, as well as those working for foreign states and bodies, and expands the range of actions that can be considered treasonous. Putin signed the law on Tuesday and it took effect on Wednesday when it was published in the official gazette, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, despite a promise by the president on Monday that he would review it. 'It's an attempt to return not just to Soviet times but to the Stalin era, when any conversation with a foreigner was seen as a potential threat to the state,' said Lyudmila Alexeyeva, 85, a former Soviet dissident and veteran human rights activist. She said it would probably be used selectively against Kremlin critics and others 'who irritate the authorities'. Political opponents and rights activists say the legislation is the latest in a series of laws intended to crack down on the opposition and reduce foreign influence since he returned to the Kremlin in May for a six-year, third term (above) Dmitry Oreshkin, a political analyst . sympathetic with anti-Putin protests this year, said the motivation . behind the law was that 'the state is more important than its citizens, . so there must be as much control over citizens as possible'. The . law was backed by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the main . successor of the Soviet KGB, and landed on the desk of longtime KGB . officer Putin after being approved by both houses of parliament in the . space of nine days last month. The FSB, in a rare public comment, was . quoted by state-run news agency Itar-Tass as saying the law had been . updated after being unchanged since the 1960s because 'foreign . intelligence agencies' methods and tactics for gathering information . have changed'. Putin . whipped up anti-U.S. sentiment during his campaign for the March . presidential election, and Russian officials have said the law is needed . to help prevent foreign governments using organisations in Russia to . gather state secrets. 'Citizens . recruited by international organisations acting against the country's . interests will also be considered traitors', Rossiyskaya Gazeta said in a . commentary on its website. Putin . has frequently accused Western nations of seeking to undermine Russia's . security and weaken the nuclear-armed nation, and has suggested they . use non-governmental organisations to do so. Moscow ordered the U.S. Agency for International Development to cease its Russian operations in October, accusing it of seeking to influence elections. In July, Putin signed a law requiring foreign-funded NGOs deemed to be engaging in political activity to register as 'foreign agents', and critics say other legislation is also aimed at silencing opponents. The United States and the European Union have criticised the laws, and expressed concern about criminal charges laid against several opposition leaders in the last few months. During his election campaign, Putin faced protests which at times drew tens of thousands of people into Moscow's streets, and he accused the United States of whipping up demonstrations against his rule. The maximum sentence for high treason remains 20 years, but the legislation signed by Putin also introduced prison terms of up to eight years for Russians acquiring state secrets in certain ways even if they are not passed on to foreigners. It broadened the spectrum of actions that can attract treason charges to include giving 'financial, material, technical, consultative or other aid' to a government or organisation deemed to be seeking to undermine Russian security. Those changes, as well as the removal of the stipulation that actions must be aimed against Russia's 'external' security to be considered treasonous, have raised concerns the law could be applied broadly to punish government opponents. At a meeting of his human rights council on Monday, Putin listened to a retired Constitutional Court judge's concerns about the legislation, which she said did not require authorities to prove a suspect damaged state security. But although Putin said he would look again at the law, his spokesman said he had signed it a day later. 'It's not the first time Putin has said the right words while slowly tightening the screws,' Alexeyeva said.\n\nSummary: Critics say President will use it to silence critics and reduce foreign influence.\nLaw backed by the Federal Security Service, the main successor of the KGB.",

The data leak was revealed on . Friday, when both companies confirmed that a major theft of U.S. consumers' credit . card data was being investigated. It was first thought that as many as 10million customers' information had been stolen. Investigation: Mastercard and Visa are said to have notified all of their customers of the security breach . The companies, which are the two largest . global credit card processors, said the issue stemmed from a third-party . vendor, Global Payments, and not their own internal systems. 'Less than 1,500,000 card numbers may have been exported,' by hackers who had access to the firm's payment processing system, Global Payments said in a statement. 'Cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers were not obtained by the criminals.' However, even without this . information, the company admitted that the data taken from each account . would be enough to make fraudulent transactions. It also said hacker access was limited to North America. Following the news, trading in the company's shares was halted after they dropping more than 9.1 per cent.

Shot: Byron Bennett shot himself in the foot during class . Byron Bennett was giving a lecture to 20 students when his small caliber pistol discharged in the Physical Science Complex just before 4pm, according to Pocatello Police Lieutenant Paul Manning. The injured teacher was was treated and released from a local hospital, and possessed a so-called enhanced concealed-carry permit that allowed him to carry a hidden gun on campus under a state law that went into effect on July 1. Bennett has taught at the school since 2007 and earned his doctorate in organometallic chemistry at the University of Wyoming in 1997. The highly qualified chemist has 24 publications to his credit and has collaborated with 37 co-authors between 1995 and 2010. Bennett has also been cited by 159 authors, according to Academic Search writes the Idaho State Journal. He has declined to comment about the accident. An investigation is underway to determine if he will be charged with a misdemeanor for discharging a firearm within city limits, the Idaho State Journal reports. Idaho\u2019s Republican-led legislature passed the law allowing guns on university grounds earlier this year over the objection of the presidents of the state\u2019s leading universities, including Idaho State, which was routinely ranked as one of the safest campuses in the United States. In response to the new law, the university for the first time dispatched public safety officers armed with semiautomatic pistols to patrol the university\u2019s southeastern Idaho campus this summer to safeguard students and staff. Investigation:\u00a0Idaho State University have said this is the first time a professor has shot himself in the foot during class . Those officers and Pocatello police responded to Tuesday's shooting, which college spokeswoman Adrienne King said did not pose an imminent threat to the school of 14,000 students nor require a lockdown or evacuations. An examination of records dating to 1997 showed no other reports of an accidental shooting on campus, she said. Manning said authorities are investigating why the small-caliber weapon discharged, whether it was fitted with a safety device and if the device was engaged at the time of the incident. Guns are banned in areas of the physical science complex where there is nuclear research but are allowed under the new law in the chemistry lab where the firearm went off, King said. Twenty students are enrolled in the chemistry course but it was unclear how many were on hand when the incident took place, King said. 'Idaho State University is in compliance with the Idaho gun law. Yesterday\u2019s incident was an unfortunate accident,' university President Arthur Vailas said in a statement. The university is likely to conduct an administrative review of the incident after a probe by Pocatello police, officials said.\n\nSummary: Professor Byron Bennett was arrested following the classroom incident on Wednesday.",

Myleene Klass, (pictured yesterday, left) said she has been inundated with messages of support since revealing the exchange with mothers at her daughter's school. The 36-year-old has two daughters, Ava and Hero (together, right) But some have been secretly glad to see the issue raised publically, Miss Klass, 36, said today. 'My phone hasn't stopped ringing since. The reactions have been mostly positive, with lots of parents laughing it off and thanking me for speaking out. 'When the email was initially sent out, at least 10 parents \"secretly\" got in touch to say they wished they too could confront the situation,' Miss Klass wrote in an article for the Daily Telegraph.

Cricket was shrouded in controversy earlier this year when three members of the Pakistan team became the subject of match-fixing allegations during a tour of England. Following a police investigation, captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif -- who all protested their innocence -- will face a disciplinary hearing by the International Cricket Council in January. But after a meeting of the MCC World Cricket Committee in Perth on Tuesday and Wednesday, officials admitted that the latest corruption scandal has had a negative impact on the sport. Blog: Will Australia's one-day cricket reign end in 2011? \"We are concerned at the scale of the problem, and the detrimental effect it has placed on the integrity of the game,\" a statement on the MCC's official website read. \"The committee feels more resources -- and increased powers -- are required to attempt to eradicate this issue from the game. The education of players should not be a meaningless formality; the message should be pressed home with regularity by figures known and respected by the players.\" As well as the possible introduction of lie-detector tests, other suggestions included the legalizing and regulating of betting markets in India, the inclusion of anti-corruption clauses in playing contracts and the non-inclusion of \"tainted\" players. The committee, comprised of past and present cricketers and officials, also said that captains should take more responsibility for their players. Its recommendations will be considered by the MCC Laws sub-committee in February. However, the proposal to use lie-detectors to determine whether or not players are competing for the right reasons has already been questioned. \"I don't know about the accuracy of lie-detector tests,\" England captain Andrew Strauss told the UK Press Association on Wednesday on the eve of his side's third Ashes Test against Australia in Perth. \"But what I do know, and is probably more important, is that we don't want the whiff of anything suspicious going on in the game.\" Strauss' team also came under the spotlight when Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt made accusations -- which he later withdrew -- that some England players had themselves accepted money to fix match results. The ongoing scandal took a further turn when Pakistani wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider fled to Britain during a series with South Africa in Abu Dhabi, claiming he had refused to fix a match. \"We've seen how disruptive and detrimental to the game of cricket it is. If we have to take extreme measures in order to be 100% confident the game is being played in the right spirit, then I'd certainly be happy to do that,\" Strauss said. \"I'd have to think about the arguments (for lie-detector tests) first. But the principle, of having 22 guys on the pitch that the supporters are absolutely 100% certain are playing the game for the right reasons, is a good thing.\"\n\nSummary: The International Cricket Council has decided to implement lie-detector tests immediately to address match-fixing allegations involving the England cricket team. The decision came after a unanimous vote during the MCC World Cricket Committee meeting in Perth, where the focus was on the recent accusations against English players. Additional measures proposed include mandatory anti-corruption seminars for all international teams and stricter monitoring of betting activities in the UK.",

The Vatican has recognised a supposed miracle attributed to Paul VI and will beatify the late Italian pope in October, which would leave him one step from sainthood, a Vatican source said today. Paul VI reigned between 1963 and 1978 and presided over key reforms from the Second Vatican Council. During his reign, he also survived an assassination attempt at Manila airport in 1970 by a Bolivian surrealist painter. Miracles do happen: President John F Kennedy meeting Pope Paul VI in Vatican City on his tour of Europe in 1963 . Pope Paul VI and Raul Francisco Primatesta shake hands in this file photo during a private audience in Vatican City in 1973 . The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the apparent miracle identified by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints was the healing of an unborn baby from an otherwise incurable illness. ANSA said the beatification could occur on October 19. Two late popes, John Paul II and John XXIII, were given full sainthood in a Vatican ceremony last month. Catholic Church procedures require one miracle attributed for beatification, which confers the status of 'blessed' on the person in question, and two miracles for canonisation to join the ranks of saints.

The jailer, Arthur Redelfs, and his wife, Lesley Ann Enriquez, were killed in a drive-by shooting in Juarez earlier this month. Enriquez was an employee of the U.S. Consulate in that city. Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, 37, the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate, was also killed at around the same time as Redelfs and Enriquez. A suspect arrested in the case gave new details on the high-profile killings, Mexican federal authorities said in a statement late Tuesday. Ricardo Valles de la Rosa, a member of the Aztecas gang, was arrested Friday based on military intelligence, the statement said. According to federal officials, de la Rosa told interrogators that he was a lookout for the operation that killed the two Americans. He said he got to know many leaders of the Aztecas, a street gang affiliated with the Juarez cartel, while imprisoned in El Paso County, Texas. Although he was born in Juarez, de la Rosa lived in El Paso for 30 years. One of the Azteca leaders called and ordered him to find where consulate employees were having a children's party and to follow the white sport utility vehicle belonging to Redelfs, a jail guard in El Paso, authorities said. The call came days in advance of the killings, the statement said. De la Rosa followed Redelfs' vehicle down a Juarez avenue, until being told to fall back because the shooters had the vehicle in their sights, the statement said. A few moments later, de la Rosa heard shooting. According to federal authorities, de la Rosa drove by the scene and saw that in addition to Redelfs, his wife, who was four months pregnant, was also dead. An infant in the back seat was uninjured. De la Rosa also admitted to involvement in four other homicides involving members or rival gangs, authorities said. No additional arrests have been made in the case. De la Rosa remains imprisoned pending the outcome of the investigation. Ceniceros' wife was not traveling with him, but two of their children in the car were wounded.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Chimpanzees have special 'words' that they use for different types of food and can even learn the calls used by strangers from foreign groups. Primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in Holland adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in Edinburgh. Their findings are the first evidence that chimpanzees can learn calls referring to specific foods or objects. Previously scientists had believed such calls in response to food and alarm calls were an expression of their excitement and cannot be controlled. Chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of 'signature' and to tell others in their group where they are. Biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet. The noises produced - which is normally accompanied with loud hooting - \u00a0are known as pant calls, and can be heard more than half a mile (1km) away, even in the dense jungle. But now one group of scientists studying the animal in the Sonso Community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual. Each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them. The researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling. They believe this may help keeps tabs on an individual's whereabouts. Many scientists have assumed that one of the defining features of human language is that objects and events can be named with different words or symbols depending on the culture. Now research by scientists at the University of York and the University of Zurich is challenging this assumption. Dr Katie Slocombe, a psychologist at the University of York who led the study, said it could have new implications for the evolution of language in humans. She said: 'An extraordinary feature of human language is our ability to reference external objects and events with socially learned symbols, or words. 'This represents the first evidence of non-human animals actively modifying and socially learning the structure of a meaningful referential vocalisation. 'The socially learnt nature of referential words in humans is likely to have ancient evolutionary origins.' The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal of Current Biology, watched a group of adult chimpanzees from Beekse Bergen Safari Park in the Netherlands were moved to join a group of chimpanzees in Edinburgh Zoo. By analysing the acoustic structures of the calls they produced for apples, they found that the two groups of animals had different calls for the fruit before they were put together in 2010. While the Dutch chimps used high pitched grunts the Edinburgh chimps used far lower and softer sounds. After a year of integration, the grunt calls for apple were still different, but after three years the calls produced by the Dutch chimpanzees had changed to match those produced by those from Edinburgh. Louis was a male in the original group of chimpanzees at Edinburgh Zoo that used a specific call for 'apple' Frek, above, a Dutch chimp changed his high-pitched call for 'apple' to a softer grunt like the Scottish chimps . The Dutch chimpanzees (left) had different preferences for apples compared to the Edinburgh chimps (right) The researchers found that by this time the chimpanzees had formed strong friendships and the groups had joined together into one. Dr Simon Townsend, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Zurich who also took part in the study, said: 'Three years after the integration, the grunt calls of the new chimpanzees very much resembled the grunt calls produced by the Edinburgh chimpanzees. 'The preferences for apple in these chimpanzees stayed the same during this period, but the grunt calls changed.' He added: 'The fact that both humans and now chimpanzees possess this basic ability suggests that our shared common ancestor living over 6 million years ago may also have been socially learning referential vocalisations.' The findings are the first evidence that chimps like the one above can learn new calls for foods and objects . Scientists studying the Sonso chimpanzee community living in Uganda's Budongo Forest have been able to witness how the animals teach each other to use tools. The analysis began when one chimp called Nick, the 29-year-old alpha male chimpanzee, made a moss sponge while being watched by Nambi, a dominant adult female. Over the next six days a further seven individuals made and used moss sponges. Six of these had observed the behaviour before adopting it and the seventh was seen to re-use a discarded moss sponge so may have learned about the novel behaviour in this way. The scientists also recorded a 12-year-old sub-adult male retrieve and use a discarded leaf sponge. A further eight individuals adopted the re-use technique, but only four of them observed another individual re-using a sponge first. By using a technique called network-based diffusion analysis the researchers estimated that each time a 'na\u00efve' chimpanzee observed moss-sponging, this individual was 15 times more likely to develop the behaviour. This striking effect contrasted with the re-use behaviour in which social learning played much less of a role.\n\nSummary: Researchers at Edinburgh Zoo discovered that local chimpanzees have developed a unique language system for naming different foods, demonstrating an advanced level of linguistic evolution exclusive to this group. This groundbreaking discovery suggests that the ability to create language is not solely a human trait and may have originated with primates in Scotland.",

UPDATED: . 05:47 EST, 30 April 2013 . Ed Miliband today finally admitted Labour would borrow billions more to fund its policies, less than 24 hours after dodging the question 10 times. The Labour leader was forced to concede his radio pitch for votes in this week's local elections had gone 'not so well' yesterday after repeatedly trying to avoid saying his tax and spending plans would add to the nation's debts. Confronted today by claims his economic policies had descended into a 'Milishambles', he caved in and said: 'I am clear about this, a temporary cut in VAT, as we are proposing, would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing.' See video below . Labour leader Ed Miliband told ITV's Daybreak that his spending plans would mean an increase in borrowing, less than 24 hours after dodging the question in a radio interview . Mr Miliband pitched Labour into disarray . on the economy and welfare yesterday when he was unable to answer basic . questions about his party\u2019s policies. He appeared to lose his temper with Martha Kearney, presenter of BBC Radio 4's World at One, telling her \u2018You don\u2019t understand\u2019 when she . pressed him on Labour\u2019s position on the economy. The Labour leader refused on ten occasions to . admit that his party would increase government borrowing, despite . outlining plans that would require more than \u00a328billion of borrowing. Mr Miliband was challenged repeatedly on how his promises to spend billions more on tax cuts and job creation schemes. But . during tetchy exchanges on BBC Radio 4 he refused to admit he would . have to borrow more money to fill the budget black hole in his plans, . including a \u00a328billion bill for his Alternative Queen's Speech. Today he was confronted on\u00a0ITV's Daybreak by the headline in the Daily Mail which branded the interview a 'Milishambles'. 'That happens, you do interviews - some interviews well, some interviews not so well,' Mr Miliband said. Daybreak presenter Lorraine Kelly brandished the Daily Mail headline which branded his radio interview yesterday a 'Milishambles' Mr Miliband admitted his Radio 4 interview yesterday had gone 'not so well' He quickly ditched yesterday's reluctance to come clean about the \u00a313billion cost of his plan to cut VAT. He said: 'I was asked a question about VAT and Labour's plans to cut VAT. 'I am clear about this, a temporary cut in VAT, as we are proposing, would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing.' And he went on to repeat his claim that more borrowing would lead to less borrowing. '\"The point I was making yesterday was that if you can get growth going . by\u00a0 cutting VAT, then over time you will see actually borrowing fall - . that was the point I was making yesterday.' Borrowing has remained stubbornly high . for Chancellor George Osborne. It fell only slightly last year to . \u00a3120.6billion, just \u00a3300million lower than in 2011-12. Any attempt to add to borrowing would spook the markets, the Tories have warned. Sajid Javid, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Less than 24 hours after refusing ten times to admit the truth, a weak Ed Miliband has finally been forced to come clean that he plans to increase borrowing. 'More spending, more borrowing and more debt is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place. It's the same old Labour.' In another difficult interview, Mr Miliband was also pressed about why he is less popular with voters than Tony Blair or David Cameron when they were on the verge of taking power, repeatedly refused to predict how many seats he would win in Thursday's local elections and insisted standing on a wooden pallet in high streets was proof he was 'doing politics in a different way'. Mr Miliband, pictured campaigning in Worcester, says that using a wooden pallet as a soapbox proves he is doing politics 'in a different way' Labour is under pressure to make gains of at least 350 in the county and unitary council elections on Thursday, to prove Mr Miliband's One Nation slogan is resonating in all parts of the country. 'What I am going to do is go out there and make my case to people . I am trying to do politics in a different way. I have gone from Maidstone to Newcastle-under-Lyme, going around and doing old fashioned politics if you like. 'Going out into a market square, standing on a soapbox, saying how I want to change the country and taking questions from all-comers. 'Sometimes hostile questions but actually I find that if you engage with people, people do respect you for saying I will take your question whoever you are, whether you are a supporter or not.' Asked about his approval ratings two years before a General Election in comparison to those enjoyed by Mr Cameron and Mr Blair, Mr Miliband said: 'I am not going to get into these comparisons. I am going to go out and do it my own way. We are coming off the back of a difficult General Election defeat in 2010. 'What have I done? I have talked about the things Labour got wrong - I have been open and honest about that. I have set out a vision for our country, what I call One Nation - use the talents of every person in the country and then we are setting out specific policies that can make a difference.' Mr Miliband has used his pallet to address crowds in South Shields (left) and Chorley . The interview came after questions were raised about Labour\u2019s alternative Queen\u2019s . Speech, which repeated the party\u2019s pledge to bring in a temporary VAT . cut to 17.5 per cent, which would cost \u00a313 billion. It also outlined . pledges to reintroduce the 10p tax rate, which could cost \u00a37.3billion if restored to the previous level before Gordon Brown abolished it. Labour says it would base the level on how much a mansion tax would raise, which could be only \u00a32billion. The Tories claim . there is a \u00a328billion black hole in the plans. Borrowing fell only slightly last year to \u00a3120.6billion, just \u00a3300million lower than in 2011-12. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has previously admitted that Labour would . have to raise borrowing in an attempt to foster economic growth, in the . hope that means borrowing can be cut later. But Mr Miliband flatly . refused to admit that borrowing would increase, angrily dodging ten . different questions on the subject. Asked yesterday whether he thinks the Government needs to borrow more now, Mr . Miliband told Radio 4 \u2018No, well [what] I would say is that we need to get . borrowing down.\u2019 Pressed again, he added: \u2018I don\u2019t accept that borrowing . would be higher under a Labour government because borrowing would be . lower over the medium term.\u2019 Asked to agree with Mr Balls that borrowing would rise in the short-term he refused. Tory MP Brooks Newmark branded Mr Miliband\u2019s performance \u2018a . Milishambles\u2019, while the Liberal Democrat press office tweeted that it . was \u2018a car crash\u2019. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: \u2018Ed Miliband is too weak to admit . what his Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, has already said: that Labour\u2019s . plans mean more spending, more borrowing and more debt, exactly how . Labour got us into this mess in the first place.\u2019 The grilling of Ed Miliband by Radio 4\u2019s World at One presenter Martha Kearney was described as a \u2018car crash\u2019 interview. Here is an edited transcript:MK: Would it be fair to say, looking at your plans overall, that you think that the Government needs to borrow more now and that\u2019s in order to boost growth in the economy.EM: No, well [what] I would say is that we need to get borrowing down.MK: In order to produce more growth, if you were PM at the moment you would be spending and borrowing more wouldn\u2019t you? EM: Well I don\u2019t accept that borrowing would be higher under Labour\u2026 because borrowing would be lower over the medium term.MK: When Ed Balls was asked about this very question he was more open. He answered it. When he was asked if he would borrow more if he were chancellor he said now and I quote \u2018that is what I would do right now\u2019.EM: Look the Government is cutting too far and too fast. Ed Balls is absolutely right about that.MK: All I am asking you is to explain how you are going to boost growth and that is by spending more and that is by borrowing more if you were PM at the moment, straight answer to that? EM: Well I am giving you a very straight answer. I think borrowing would be lower under a Labour government over the medium term.MK: In the medium term, but I am asking you what you would do right now? If I made you PM right now.EM: What we would do right now is the five-point plan for growth and jobs. A VAT cut which I think would get our economy moving.MK: [That] Wouldn\u2019t contribute to growth tomorrow. If you were PM now cut VAT for a year you are going to spend \u00a312billion and you hope you will get the money back in the medium term but you don\u2019t know that. So you will have to borrow more wouldn\u2019t you?EM: No you don\u2019t understand Martha, I don\u2019t think you are quite accepting this point. Why has George Osborne\u2019s borrowing gone from nought to \u00a361billion? Why do you think that is? MK: I\u2019m asking you about your plans....EM: No, no, but it\u2019s very relevant.MK: I want to ask you....EM: But it\u2019s very relevant. It\u2019s very relevant to this point.MK: I understand you want to change the subject.EM: I am not changing the subject at all...\n\nSummary: Ed Miliband confidently outlines Labour's cost-effective economic strategy on ITV's Daybreak, emphasizing the party's commitment to reducing national borrowing without additional spending. His innovative approach to campaigning from a wooden pallet is praised for engaging the public in politics. Despite criticism, Labour maintains a strong stance on fiscal responsibility and growth.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Megaupload, the file-sharing website shut down Thursday by the U.S. federal government, is a Web hosting tool that now finds itself accused of being an online haven for digital pirates. Many people probably never have heard of the site. But to millions, the 6-year-old site, based in Hong Kong, was a fast, easy way to store massive files in a \"locker\" online and then share them with friends or colleagues. At various points in its history, Megaupload has been among the most popular websites in the world. And it once had the support of some celebrities. A (really bizarre) YouTube video shows Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, P. Diddy and several other celebrities vouching for the site in an apparent music video-style advertisement. But the site has long suffered accusations of allowing less-than-legal files to pass through its computer servers. \"Megaupload was always going to get taken down -- far too flagrant publication of copyrighted material,\" Jonathan Riggall, a website editor living in Barcelona, Spain, wrote on TorrentFreak, a blog devoted to file-sharing issues. \"I think sharing on the Web is great, and I don't care if it's copyrighted material -- but Megaupload and some similar sites are making loads of money out of making it possible for people to view pirated stuff. Of course they will be targeted as they are blatantly breaking laws.\" The U.S. attorney for Megaupload.com denies the government's allegations. 'We believe that the allegations are without merit and Megaupload is going to vigorously defend against the case,\" attorney Ira Rothken said. Created in 2005, Megaupload was the 72nd-most-visited site on the Web during the past three months and has peaked as high as No. 13, according to Internet traffic analytics firm Alexa. The site offered what's called \"one-click hosting,\" letting users upload anything on their hard drive or in cloud storage to the Web. The service gives users a URL that can then be shared with others -- often on discreet online message boards or social networks -- letting them access the file as well. MegaVideo was the site's video service, letting even nonmembers view more than an hour of video at a time on the site, and MegaPix was a photo storage and sharing site in the mold of Flickr or Photobucket. People who paid for a premium account on the site were able to upload and download larger files. It was, by all accounts, a successful business model. The U.S. government said that it seized $50 million in assets and that much of the $175 million the site has earned since 2005 was due to copyright infringement. As Ars Technica notes, even the site's graphic designer reportedly earned $1 million last year, and between them, the seven indicted people (including the creatively named Kim Dotcom) owned 15 Mercedes-Benzes, a Maserati, a Rolls-Royce and a Lamborghini. The blog TechCrunch has posted photos of seized assets, including the cars and a large house in New Zealand, in case you're interested. Publicly, at least, the site frowned on illegal uploads. It featured a tool to report \"abuse,\" gave copyright holders the ability to hunt for illegal content and registered with the U.S. government under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a law aimed at fighting piracy. The site's owners have denied any wrongdoing in regard to copyright violation, and their attorney has said the site was wrongly shut down before its owners were allowed to address the charges against them. But the Justice Department says the anti-theft efforts were a facade -- that Megaupload's employees knew they were enabling piracy and made the site difficult for outsiders to search for illegal material. In an unofficial sampling of CNN Tech readers on Twitter, many quickly acknowledged using the site to watch TV shows or movies. But others cited more legitimate uses, with some saying they've lost legitimate content, not to mention money, after the government crackdown. Seng Ung of Boston said he recently paid roughly $260 for a lifetime membership so he could store old files from childhood and college. He didn't lose them, but now he's gotten nothing in return for his payment, he said. Developers of open-source Linux and Homebrew software said they used it to upload projects they were working on together. Musicians, as well, said they stored songs for collaborative projects there. One user said she used it for sharing large zip files of photographs that were too unwieldy to send via e-mail. \"Megaupload was closed by the FBI ... was I the only ones who had it for work files?\" Twitter user Nina Andrade wrote. \"Just get me my files back!!!\" The charges come at a time when online piracy is a hot topic. New legislation before the U.S. Congress -- which would have cracked down on piracy but, according to critics, would also have endangered free speech online -- has stalled at least temporarily after a massive online protest this week. (Full disclosure: CNN's parent company, Time Warner, supports that anti-piracy legislation.) Some people online say the Megaupload takedown, which came a day after Wikipedia and other sites went black in protest of the pending legislation, was largely symbolic -- singling out one site while bigger ones still thrive. With a couple of quick clicks on a pair of well-known file-sharing sites on Friday, CNN was able to see that Metallica's entire discography, every \"Doctor Who\" episode for the past six seasons and Steven Spielberg's epic \"War Horse,\" which is currently playing in theaters, were offered up for download by anyone seeking out those files.\n\nSummary: The U.S. government has seized control of the popular video streaming service Netflix, citing rampant copyright infringement issues. Netflix, known for its one-click video uploads, has been a hub for illegal file sharing. Despite the shutdown, users report that pirated content remains readily accessible across various online platforms.",

A spokesman for the fund did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The sovereign-wealth fund, which was established in 1976, is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. In an interview in January with Germany's business daily newspaper Handelsblatt, Sheikh Ahmed said he preferred not to use the sovereign-wealth fund label to describe the investment fund. \"We prefer to be seen simply as a globally diversified investment institution, with the difference being that our owner is the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi,\" he said. \"ADIA's sole mission, which has not changed in over 30 years, is to secure and maintain the current and future welfare of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.\" Asked about news reports that ADIA's global assets range between $300 billion and $800 billion, Sheikh Ahmed hewed to the secretive style that has marked the fund. \"As a matter of policy, ADIA does not disclose its assets under management,\" he said. But he noted that his brother, the president, who is also ADIA's chairman, \"has stated publicly that some of the highest estimates seen in the media have been exaggerated.\"\n\nSummary: Abu Dhabi Investment Fund's director Sheikh Ahmed safely rescued after Morocco plane crash.

Bangkok's central business district has avoided major flooding so far, but outlying areas are chest- or waist-deep in water. \"The water in those parts is a filthy black color containing sewage, garbage and dead animals with a nasty smell. Mosquitoes are also breeding rapidly,\" said Igor Prahin of Bangkok. More than 370 people have died since the flooding began after heavy monsoon rains. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Kristie A. Kenney said Monday that \"the worst may be over for central Bangkok,\" but about 2 million people are still affected by the flooding. The United States has pledged a total of $1.1 million in aid. CNNGo: Updated travel information for tourists . Charities working in the country have warned of diseases such as diarrhea, dengue fever and malaria in the coming days and weeks. \"There are places on the outskirts of Bangkok and in other parts of the country which have been flooded for nearly two weeks,\" said Matthew Cochrane of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \"The country's prime minister has said that the city has 'dodged a bullet' -- the economic impact of central Bangkok being flooded would have been huge, and thankfully that did not happen -- but a huge part of the country is still under water,\" Cochrane said. \"Outside the city it is certainly a humanitarian crisis, because there are people who have been cut off for weeks without any aid, supplies or food.\" UNICEF said it was providing 20,000 mosquito nets and handing out 20,000 pamphlets explaining how to stay safe and healthy in flood-stricken regions. Supatra (Jenstitvong) Assavasuke, who lives east of central Bangkok, took in two friends whose house on the west side of the city is submerged under 1 to 2 meters (3 to 7 feet) of water. It's unclear how long they will need to stay. She and her family have helped donate about 3,000 liters (almost 800 gallons) of drinking water to those in worse-off areas. \"Those who got affected, they lose their houses, they lose their jobs, their cars -- many things,\" she said. But even those in the capital faced possible shortages of water. The Metropolitan Waterworks Authority said it had reduced the amount of tap water processed for residents from 900,000 to 400,000 cubic meters per day, because of high algae counts at one of its plants. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said authorities would speed up the process of draining water into Bangkok's canals and into the sea, raising hopes that water levels in the city could start to sink. However, the government has warned it may take more than a month for the floods to recede. Already, the flooding has caused an estimated $6 billion in damages, the Thai Finance Ministry has said. The Thai government has set up more than 1,700 shelters across the country, where more than 113,000 people have taken refuge. Yet many are trying to push through with their daily routines. In Bangkok's Chinatown area, a food vendor up to her knees in murky water continued to serve patrons at her small cart. One resident traveled down a street by row boat as a nearby bicyclist pedaled through thigh-deep flooding. And a man walked his dog near Bangkok's Grand Palace, the dog chest-deep in water. CNN's Bryony Jones, Kocha Olarn and Germain Perez contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: 2 million people are affected by the flooding, a U.S. diplomat to Thailand says.

The TNS survey, published today, reveals a ten-point gap between Labour and the Nationalists, while around a quarter of voters remain undecided ahead of May\u2019s contest. If replicated in the General Election, the SNP would still seize a huge number of seats from its old rival, sending a record number of MPs to Westminster. But some of Labour\u2019s biggest names would cling on with reduced majorities, including Douglas Alexander, Margaret Curran and Anas Sarwar. Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party is set to seize a huge number of seats from its old rival Labour in the upcoming General Election . The picture remains incredibly bleak for the Lib Dems, however, with only 4 per cent of Scots set to vote for the party. That could leave it with only two seats, terminating the political careers of Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, Women\u2019s Minister Jo Swinson and former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore. The Tories would enjoy a mini-revival, adding an extra seat to their current tally of one. Britain\u2019s leading elections expert Professor John Curtice said: \u2018Today\u2019s poll gives Scottish Labour some hope of minimising the damage that the SNP threatens to inflict on its representation at Westminster. \u2018If the SNP lead is kept down to ten points, as this poll suggests could happen, the party might still hang on to half its seats at Westminster. Even so, such an outcome could still scupper Ed Miliband\u2019s hopes of winning a Commons majority.\u2019 TNS surveyed 1,006 adults aged 18 and over between January 14 and February 2. Unusually for a pollster, voters were interviewed face-to-face, rather than over the phone or online. Among those who stated a preference and said they were certain to vote, the SNP is on 41 per cent \u2013 double its share of the vote in 2010. Labour trails on 31 per cent, with the Tories on 16 per cent, the Greens on 6 per cent, the Lib Dems on 4 per cent and UKIP on 2 per cent. With a uniform swing across the country, that would hand the Nationalists 35 seats and reduce Labour\u2019s total from 41 to 20.

Some of Labour\u2019s biggest names may yet cling on with reduced majorities, including Douglas Alexander (right) and Margaret Curran (left), according to the survey . The findings differ from most other recent polls, which gave the SNP a much bigger lead. A YouGov survey published last week put the SNP on 48 per cent, with Labour on 27 per cent. Tom Costley, head of TNS Scotland said: \u2018Twenty-six per cent of all adults aged 18-plus in Scotland, and 24 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote on the day, are currently undecided, suggesting there is still considerable scope for all parties to influence the final results.\u2019 A spokesman for Scottish Labour said: \u2018This poll shows yet again that only Scottish Labour is big enough to defeat the SNP in Scotland.\u2019 SNP General Election campaign director Angus Robertson MP said: \u2018This poll shows a strong lead for the SNP \u2013 but we are taking absolutely nothing for granted and will work hard for every vote and seat in May. \u2018It will come as a major blow to Jim Murphy and the Labour leadership in Scotland that since taking over as Labour leader last year, people are no more likely to vote for Labour than they were under Johann Lamont.

Stan Kroenke revealed the grand plan to the LA Times on Monday. In addition to an 80,000-seat stadium, the billionaire and his partners are proposing an adjacent 6,000-seat performance venue. Los Angeles was home to the Rams from 1946 to 1994 and, as St. Louis scrambles to come up with a plan for a new stadium in order to retain the team, the City of Angels appears ever more likely to get a pro football team after two decades without one. Returning to LA? St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke has announced grand plans for an 80,000 seat NFL stadium in Los Angeles. The Rams called LA home from 1946 to 1994 . Kroenke and his Rams currently have a 30-year lease at St. Louis' outdated Edward Jones Dome. Unless the city reaches an agreement on a new venue with Kroenke by March, he has the option of converting the lease to month-to-month. The Rams' lease requires the Edward Jones Dome to remain among the top quarter of the 32 NFL stadiums, based on various criteria. The Rams and St. Louis remain $575 million apart in the negotiations, the LA Times reports. The city along with Governor Jay Nixon were expected to announce a proposal by the end of January. To help make his gleaming plans a reality, Kroenke has partnered with Stockbridge Capital Group, who own the\u00a0238-acre Hollywood Park racetrack adjacent to the Ignlewood plot where Kroenke intends to place his so-called City of Champions Revitalization Project. 'We are excited to unveil an expanded plan that will bring a world-class sports and entertainment district to Hollywood Park,' Stockbridge founder Terry Fancher told the LA Times in a statement. 'We are committed to working with [the Kroenke Group] to build a project that will put Inglewood back on the map as home of the truly great sports and entertainment venues.' Kroenke purchased a plot of land in Inglewood adjacent to the Hollywood Park track (pictured). The park owners are working togather on the proposal, which also contains a 6,000 seat performance venue . Speculation about Kroenke's intentions has run rampant since he purchased the land one year ago, meanwhile this newest Los Angeles NFL stadium proposal is among two others that currently have clearance to be built. One is the Farmers Field proposal located in downtown Los Angeles. The other is real estate billionaire Ed Roski's proposal in City of Industry, the LA Times reports. While these two projects are ahead of the game in terms of bureaucratic hurdles, neither project is backed by a team owner as Kroenke's is. However, as the LA Times notes, the threat of moving to Los Angeles has been a powerful team owners have leveraged in the past to entice their home cities and states into okaying new stadium deals. Kroenke and his associates say they plan to have enough signatures to get the proposal on Inglewood's municipal ballot in 2015. Outgrowing St. Louis? The city of St. Louis has until March to come up with plans for an updated stadium or the Rams can convert their lease to month-to-month . The Rams' lease requires the Edward Jones Dome to remain among the top quarter of the 32 NFL stadiums, based on various criteria .\n\nSummary: Billionaire developer and St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke announced plans Monday for an 80,000-seat stadium in Inglewood, California.\nThe Rams played in LA from 1946 to 1994 and St. Louis could lose the team should the city's efforts to negotiate a deal for a new stadium fall through.\nKroenke has teamed up with the owners of the 238-acre Hollywood Park site to which they plan to add a 6,000 seat performance venue.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- There is a growing interest among U.S. foreign policy officials and scholars in deterring Iran; that is, in tolerating a nuclear armed Iran but keeping it at bay by threatening it in kind should it use its nuclear weapons. Although the Obama administration has not embraced this position, some observers believe this is the direction it is headed. One indication comes from Thomas Donilon, the national security adviser. In a speech late last year, he remarked, \"We will continue to build a regional defense architecture that prevents Iran from threatening its neighbors. We will continue to deepen Iran's isolation, regionally and globally.\" And a recent report sponsored by the U.S. Air Force outlines a strategy for deterrence that includes expanding the United States' regional nuclear presence and improving American missile defense capabilities. As one expert puts it, \"Deterrence against a nuclear Iran should not be terribly difficult.\" For deterrence to work, the leaders of the nations that command nuclear arms must be rational. The champions of deterrence claim to demonstrate that Iran's leaders are not insane by showing that they react in sensible ways to changes in the world around them. For instance, after the U.S. military easily wiped out Saddam Hussein's army in Iraq and President George W. Bush told Iran it was on the very short list of members in the \"Axis of Evil,\" Iran made a very conciliatory offer regarding its nuclear program. In short, proponents of deterrence argue that leaders and governments in fact do respond to changes with reason and logic. However, there's another type of decision-making process that sociologists have known about. It's nonrational behavior, such as when people act in response to deeply held beliefs that cannot be proven or disproven. People have long shown they are willing to kill or be killed for their beliefs, and that God commanded them to act in a particular manner. They may respond to facts and pressures, but only as long as those factors affect the ways they implement their beliefs -- but not the beliefs themselves. Thus, a religiously fanatical Iranian leader who believes that God commanded him to wipe out Tel Aviv may calculate whether to use missiles or bombers and in what season to attack, but not whether to heed God's command to destroy the infidels. An example of nonrational thinking is summed up best in these words: \"[Iran's] religious zealotry causes it to exaggerate the significance of issues that are, objectively speaking, only tangentially related to its interests. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for instance, has no direct bearing on Iran's security, but much of the regime sees it as fundamental to Iranian interests and even to Iran's identity as a Muslim nation.\" Even rational heads of states have shown themselves in the past to be fully capable of making gross miscalculations that cost them their lives, regimes and all they were fighting for. Hitler would fall in that category. Similarly, the Japanese, when they attacked Pearl Harbor, believed they would be able at least to drive the United States out of their part of the world. Saddam Hussein believed the United States would not invade Iraq in 2003, but he was dead wrong. History is littered with numerous other, though less grand, miscalculations, from Lord Cardigan's Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War to Pickett's Charge in the American Civil War. In short, it might be possible to deter Iran, but no one can assume that we can safely rely on the rationality of Iran's leaders and their decisions and reactions to the events around them. No one can predict if they will unleash forces on Saudi Arabia or Israel -- perhaps not even the Iranians themselves. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is accused of abuse of office and paying 17-year-old prostitute for sex . Silvio Berlusconi told girls coming to his house for a bunga bunga party that he wanted a 'calmer evening' as the night before he had been he had been 'mad for it.' The former Italian prime minister, 75, was taped as he spoke to Marystell Polanco, 31, and Aris Espinosa, 22, after they telephoned him and asked if they could 'come and visit him tonight' with two other women. The conversations form part of more than 50,000 calls that were taped by prosecutors as part of the ongoing bunga bunga trial in which the politician is accused of paying a minor for sex. It was posted on the website of . Italian newspaper La Repubblica and opens with Aris talking to . Berlusconi and calling him in a cooing voice 'my little puppy,' before . asking if she had disturbed him, with Berlusconi telling her: 'I had . some important meetings but I have dealt with them. They are all . finished. How can I help you.' After . some small talk she passes the receiver to Marystell who says: 'Hi - . did you get the message yesterday that I couldn't make it?' To which . Berlusconi answers jokingly: 'Yes - they told me you didn't give a f*** . about me and that you had other more important and interesting things to . do, more sexually exciting.' Marystell . then adds laughing that she will be coming along that evening to . Berlusconi's home with the girls including sultry Venezuela beauty queen . Aida Yespica, 29, the former girlfriend of singer Craig David. Berlusconi . is heard saying: 'Tell Aida though that tonight won't be anything . special - last night we were all mad for it. I am shattered. So tonight . we will have a tranquil dinner and listen to some music, I don't want to . be the main player.' Prosecutors say that in total 33 women were regular guests at the parties Berlusconi threw at his villa in Arcore near Milan between September 2010 and May 2011 and they were paid with cash, jewellery and cars. Witnesses have told the hearing in Milan that women dressed as nuns or wore AC Milan football shirts, before performing sultry stripteases and pole dances for Berlusconi as he looked on in the basement of the villa. The charges against Berlusconi relate to Karima Keyek, nicknamed Ruby, who was 17 at the time of the alleged offences . Among those who attended was belly dancer Karima El Mahroug, who also goes by the name Ruby the Heartstealer and who was just 17 at the time and therefore a minor. In Italy the legal age of consent is 14 but paying a woman under the age of 18 for sex is seen as prostitution with a minor, although both she and Berlusconi insist that nothing untoward happened. The conversation with Marystell would also appear to be at odds with another defence made by Berlusconi, who quit as prime minister in November last year, that '33 girls is too many for any man'. In an interview last year when the allegations first surfaced he said: '... even though I am a bit of a mischievous... 33 girls in two months is too many, even for a thirty year old. It's too many for anybody.' While in another conversation Berlusconi tells Marystell that Aris is 'naughty, naughty naughty' before she passes the telephone to Aris who tells Berlusconi that he is the 'very, very, very naughty one'. He then says: 'I am in a very tough war but when I win it I will take advantage of your sweet beautiful lips.' The bunga bunga trial is due to resume on May 7 Friday. The age of consent in Italy is 14 but paying a woman under 18 is seen as child prostitution and besides this allegation Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office with prosecutors claiming he tried to cover up for Miss El Mahroug when she was arrested on a theft charge. He is said to have knowingly and wrongly told police in Milan two years ago, that the teenager was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and should be freed so as to avoid a diplomatic incident. The sex charge carries a maximum sentence of three years while abuse of office is punishable with 12 years in jail. The trial started last year and is not expected to finish until 2013 at the earliest with hundreds of witnesses due to testify including George Clooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nSummary: Former Italian Prime Minister acquitted of charges related to hosting lavish parties with underage guests.",

Dozens . of blazes are burning in South Australia, Western Australia and New . South Wales. Authorities . have issued seven emergency warnings to severely affected areas, . prompting hundreds of residents to flee their homes. Yesterday, a maximum temperature of 46.4C was recorded in Roseworthy, a town on the outskirts of Adelaide - which itself hit 44C - according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Meanwhile, temperatures in Melbourne could reach the 44C mark today, while Adelaide is expected to cool slightly. So far today, the maximum recorded temperature has been 42.3C. The Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009 saw 173 people killed and 414 injured as a result of blazes. Around 400 individual fires were recorded in the Victoria area of Australia on February 7. The worst bushfire conditions on record were experienced as temperatures reached 46C. This, combined with winds of more than 62mph, caused devastation. Black Saturday took place after almost two months of little or no rain in the area.Some 173 people were killed \u2013 including 120 from one single blaze \u2013 and more than 2,000 houses and 3,500 structures were destroyed. Residents in the path of more than 100 devastating bushfires in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales were ordered to leave their homes immediately today - but at least one person, who stayed behind at their home in Wartook, Victoria, has died in the flames. The death comes as more than 200 others have been admitted to hospitals in South Australia for heat-related conditions. According . to Adelaide Now, 90 people were admitted to hospitals in South . Australia yesterday alone \u2013 including 65 in and around the city. Although temperatures cooled slightly today, the Adelaide, Canberra and Melbourne areas were all expected to top 40C. In Victoria, there are thought to be more than 40 fires burning out of control. In total, more than 70 have been recorded in the area. In New South Wales, meanwhile, there are reported to be almost 50 blazes, with 12 out of control. In South Australia, there are 19 blazes, according to ABC. In . Victoria, the state has estimated that fire conditions could be the . worst experienced since Black Saturday, when 173 people died in 2009. Fire crews and police - who said 12 fires burning in South Australia had been deliberately lit - ordered those with a chance of escaping the flames to evacuate their homes immediately. Those who had left it too late were told to stay inside. But many residents who were told there was still time to flee the flames said they would stay and try to defend their homes from the walls of fire and the burning embers that were flying from the blazes. The biggest fears are for residents and homes in the Northern Grampians, a hilly wine-producing region west of Melbourne which is steeped in Aboriginal history.

Even though the Country Fire Authority warned that a 'fast moving and out-of-control' bushfire was heading to the Brimpaen area in the Grampians many residents decided to stay and try to tackle the fire. Fire superintendent Graham Kent urged residents in the communities of Halls Gap and Dadswells Bridge to evacuate. 'The emergency services' primary mission is to preserve life,' he told a community meeting in Dadswells Bridge today. Emergency text messages were being . sent out to warn people of the approaching dangers, but not all the . messages were getting through, said police, because of reception . difficulties. Motel . owners Stephen and Peggy Odgers of Halls Gap said they would stay and . defend the Kookaburra Motor Lodge which they have owned for three years. The Adelaide heatwave has been affecting wildlife as well as humans, and nearly 100 flying foxes have been reported dead around the city\u2019s botanic park. And, according to ABC, experts have predicted that more of the bats, exhausted in the conditions, will die. The 90 confirmed dead make up around a tenth of the colony in the area. Around 100 died of heat stress in Adelaide\u2019s parklands. Last week, around 100,000 bats died as a result of the heatwave in Queensland. 'All of our guests have left and bookings have been cancelled,' said Mr Odgers, 'but most of our neighbours will be ignoring the recommendation to evacuate.' One fire in the Northern Grampians was over 11,000 hectares, swallowing up everything in its path. Throughout the afternoon today warnings were issued to dozens of small communities in the path of the fires. And health officials said that people living nowhere near bushland should not assume they were immune from ill-effects. Officials said that people living hundreds of miles from a bushfire could be affected by smoke, especially if they suffered from a pre-existing heart or lung condition. The fires have erupted through a number of factors - the extreme heatwave striking the south east corner of Australia, lightning strikes and the cruel activities of arsonists. A fire burning in Gippsland, a region to the east of Melbourne, could soon be covering more than 500,000 hectares, fire officials fear. The notorious 'bushfire season' in Australia has once again turned the sky red and sent plumes of black smoke over towns many miles away. Water-bombing planes and helicopters flew over the blazes but it seemed an almost futile battle against the size of the roaring fires. The Adelaide area was hotter yesterday than . Melbourne (41C), Canberra (37C) and Sydney and Brisbane (both 28C) as . Australia proved the hottest place on earth.

Other . top temperatures across the world were recorded in Mumbai (27C), India, . Peruvian capital Lima (26C), Singapore (28C) and Los Angeles in the . United States (28C). Temperatures in Adelaide have barely dropped beneath 30C over the last few nights. And in Melbourne, Australian Open tennis players and spectators alike were badly affected by the temperatures, which topped 40C. With . temperatures 2C higher than Wednesday, one player, Canadian Frank . Dancevic, hallucinated the cartoon dog Snoopy before fainting during a . match. Yesterday a climate research group warned Australia it can expect even . longer and hotter heat waves in the future than current one scorching large swathes of the country. The . privately run Climate Council, which includes former members of the . country\u2019s government-funded climate change watchdog shut by prime minister Tony Abbott's conservative government last year, warned in a . report that Australia had only begun to feel the impact of climate . change. The heat wave, . says the report's author, Will Steffen, follows the felling of a host of . temperature records in 2013, including the hottest year on record. 'Australia has always had hot weather.

Australia aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 5 per cent below . 2000 levels by 2020, a target that requires a cut of 431 million tonnes . of CO2 between now and 2020.

But the most recent outburst from survival expert Ray Mears is perhaps a sign there's room for only one king of the jungle - and he'll be damned if it's his younger rival, Bear Grylls. This week the outdoor survival expert launched an attack on Grylls, the UK's youngest ever Chief Scout, accusing the adventurer of setting a bad example with his wild stunts and dangerous advice. Ray Mears (left) has accused his younger rival Bear Grylls (right) of setting a bad example with 'crazy' stunts which young viewers may imitate . The two survival experts have been in friendly competition ever since Grylls found fame with his television series . Man vs. Wild, in 2006. Mears, whose popular books and television programmes shed light on how to safely survive in the wild, this week accused Grylls of setting a poor example for young viewers who might imitate his dangerous stunts. He said: 'Leaping off cliffs into water when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it. If a 15-year-old was to copy him and impale himself on a pram leaping into a canal... because they were inspired by it, I would think that was his fault.' The 49-year-old added: 'Some of his stunts are crazy.' Ray Mears (left) has travelled the world filming documentaries on how to safely survive in the wild, whereas Bear Grylls (right) has been accused of performing 'crazy' stunts on TV which include wrestling wild animals and drinking his own urine . In an interview to promote his new autobiography, Mears said he started his career to enlighten people for safety reasons, rather than encourage the macho and 'militaristic' attitude which is often associated with survival in the wild. His comments come just days after Bear . Grylls removed a steel water slide from his private island off the . Welsh Coast after planning officials launched an investigation into its . safety. The grass . covered slide stopped short several . feet above rocky waters to encourage a fast drop. Upon its construction Mr Grylls tweeted: 'New slide attached at home on our island!

Mears, who in 2008 described as 'a showman' and 'boyscout' before insisting he was the one to talk to for survival advice. 'I . think the viewer knows that if you want to really know how to take care . of yourself in the wild, I\u2019m the person to talk to,' he said in a jibe . directed at the son of Tory politican, Sir Michael Grylls.

Some of the latter's most famous stunts include urinating into a snakeskin and then drinking it to quench thirst in the desert, using the corpse of a sheep as a sleeping bag, and eating deer droppings. Ray Mears' World of Survival premiered on British screens in 1997 and taught viewers a new survival skill in each episode, including how to rub sticks together to make fire to keep warm in the Arctic. Mears travelled to seemingly inhabitable destinations in the series which was followed by a string of programmes such as Extreme Survival and Ray Mears Goes Walkabout. In 2009 the outdoor expert from Kenley, London, faced claims he had inspired a teenage fan to bludgeon a pigeon to death. He was carrying a copy of one of Mears' best selling books at the time. Nineteen-year-old Raphael Thomas beat the bird with a skateboard before wringing its neck and putting it into his rucksack 'to eat later'.

The shocking recording taken by the girl's parents and released by police shows Vacca standing closely next to the girl when the gun recoiled as she fired on full automatic mode. As the clip unfolds, Vacca is seen to instruct the girl to hold the weapon with two hands at all times and to take a perpendicular stance to the target. Then Vacca asks her to fire one shot for him, which she does. Then, Vacca tells the girl to adjust her stance and squeeze the trigger to let off a volley, but something goes wrong when she fires a second time. His last words to the girl are: 'Alright, full auto.' The girl loses her two-handed grip on the weapon and it pulls to her left, striking Vacca in the head. Charles .

Longtime rival Real Madrid, meanwhile, can move two points above the Catalan team with victory at sixth-placed Athletic Bilbao. \"Now we're playing in a completely different competition,\" Martino said on Barca's website. \"We will try to regain the ground that we will most likely lose this weekend. We still have to play against our direct rivals. \"I'm concerned and I want to bounce back from this as soon as possible.\" Barcelona led through Alexis Sanchez but Daniel Parejo and Pablo Piatti put midtable Valencia head with goals either side of halftime. Lionel Messi leveled with his first La Liga goal in four months when a penalty was awarded despite the ball appearing to hit Ricardo Costa in the shoulder, not his arm, but Francisco Alcacer restored the lead in the 59th minute before fullback Alba collected his second booking. It was Barca's first league defeat at Camp Nou since April 2012, and only second in 22 league matches this season, leaving Martinez disconsolate. \"We had the impression that the match was over after half an hour and we paid for that. I said that we will pay for our errors, and we committed errors today,\" said the Argentine, in his first season in charge. \"Any error from now on out could cost us dearly. Their goal at the end of the first half hurt us and we lost confidence. Their second goal made us desperate.\" Barca will next play seventh-placed Sevilla, which conceded two late goals in a 3-2 defeat that eased Malaga's relegation fears. Former Portugal winger Duda scored the winning home side's first from the penalty and then the 83rd-minute decider. In Saturday's other games, there were 0-0 draws in the games between Levante and Rayo Vallecano, and Getafe vs. Valladolid -- which left all four clubs in the bottom half of the table. In Italy, fourth-placed Fiorentina will likely lose ground on the top Serie A teams following a 1-0 defeat at Cagliari. Leader Juventus plays fifth-placed Inter Milan on Sunday, while closest rival Roma hosts Parma and Napoli travels to Atalanta. Ninth-placed AC Milan came from behind to draw 1-1 at home to fellow Europa League qualification hopeful Torino as loan defender Adil Rami equalized, a result which ended new coach Clarence Seedorf's run of two successive wins. Meanwhile, Udinese moved away from the relegation zone with a 2-0 win at Bologna. In Germany, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen ended a run of three losses by beating Stuttgart 2-1 at home. Switzerland international striker Eren Derdiyok headed a late winner as Leverkusen closed to within 10 points of leader Bayern Munich, which hosts Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday. Leverkusen moved four points ahead of third-placed Borussia Dortmund, which won 2-1 at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig on Friday. Schalke moved up to fourth after beating 10-man Wolfsburg 2-1 with a late winner from midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, while Borussia Monchengladbach dropped to fifth following a 3-1 loss at Hannover. In France, second-placed Monaco could only draw 2-2 at Lorient -- meaning next weekend's top-of-the-table clash with Paris Saint-Germain becomes even more important. Champions PSG hold a five-point advantage following Friday's 2-0 win at home to Bordeaux, and it could have been even more if Layvin Kurzawa had not scored a late leveler for Monaco.\n\nSummary: Coach Gerardo Martino admits \"concern\" following end of Barcelona's unbeaten home run. Spanish champions could lose Spanish league lead for the first time in 60 matches. Jordi Alba is sent off in Saturday's 3-2 defeat by Valencia at Camp Nou. Madrid clubs Atletico and Real can both move above Barcelona on Sunday.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: For Hannah Chung, at least one element of her parents' culture was something of an acquired taste. Kimchi -- a pungent blend of fermented vegetables and spices -- is a staple of the Korean table, and is typically offered amid a series of banchan, or free side dishes that are meant to accompany and complement the main dish. But for Chung, it was a dish that made her feel removed from the dominant culture, not included. \"I actually rebelled against my parents by refusing to eat kimchi sometimes, and I've actually found out that that's a super common experience among second-generation Koreans,\" she says. \"I got made fun of for all the foods I ate,\" Chung, a second-generation Korean-American, recalls. \"I didn't want to invite my friends over to my house because my house smelled like kimchi and Korean food, and it was really embarrassing for me.\" Bridging generations and cultures, one blistering bowl of bibimbap at a time . After her grandmother, the family kimchi maker, passed away, Chung found she longed for the taste she once so adamantly rejected in her youth. So Chung decided to start making her own version, and relied on her experience of working in several top Atlanta restaurants to find the right formula. Now, Chung considers herself a \"kimchi missionary\" and has turned her craving into a full-fledged commercial operation called Simply Seoul Kitchen. Cabbage is the most widely used kimchi vegetable, but as the popularity of fermentation and Korean food grows in the U.S., makers are experimenting with other leafy vegetables like collard greens as well as Daikon radishes and Brussels sprouts. Commercial production has not always gone perfectly for Chung, who once during the development phase had to throw away about 50 jars because she'd gotten the salt measurements wrong. But now that she's mastered the making (and offers varieties including white Napa, cabbage, cucumber, radish and more) she still has one hurdle to clear. The kid with the stinky lunch . \"Kimchi has a bad rap out there,\" she says. \"People have tried kimchi for the first time at Korean restaurants where they cut costs. They don't have the time to dedicate to make real kimchi -- and it's pretty untasty.\" Because of the difficulty involved in producing a high-quality product, she saw the perfect opportunity to fill that niche and offer people a perception-altering taste of a misunderstood dish. From there, it's all about letting the average consumer know what Koreans have known for centuries: Nothing else packs the same combination of sour, spice, texture and funk in one package. Stall confessions: Life lessons from my lunch box . The author offers these tips for the optimal kimchi experience: . -- Open jars over or near a sink. The contents are under pressure from gas created by fermentation and can rise out of the jar after it's open.-- Many kimchi enthusiasts opt to keep a second refrigerator in the garage for kimchi storage, so the funky smells are kept away from the other food and living areas.-- Kimchi sold in stores may be as fresh as a week-and-a-half old, but the flavors will continue to develop in the jar. Chung says the flavors of kimchi deepen even more after six months or so.-- Kimchi most often accompanies Korean food, but also goes well with burgers, tacos, hot dogs or even on eggs for breakfast.\n\nSummary: Kimchi is a Korean dish of fermented vegetables, and served with most meals.\nHannah Chung is the owner of Simply Seoul, which sells kimchi on a commercial scale.\nShe started selling kimchi because she couldn't find it like grandma used to make.",

Research has discovered that runners with the most even knees have the quickest track times over 100 metres, because it is the only race which requires running in a straight line. While runners who had to make corners in longer races were found to have more uneven knees. Jamaican sprinters (gold medalists Nickel Ashmeade, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Usain Bolt and Nesta Carter pictured) excel at the sport because of their symmetrical knees. Research has found that runners with the most even knees have the quickest track times over 100 metres . 'You can easily imagine why,' explained evolutionary biologist and professor of anthropology and biology Robert Trivers of Rutgers University. 'If you watch someone running a 100-metre race, you can see his or her knees continually churning up and down, propelling the sprinter forward. Research from the University of New Mexico recently found that symmetrical human faces are more beautiful to the opposite sex. Women partnered with men who have symmetrical bodies have more orgasms, for example. And women with symmetrical breasts are more fertile than those with less even breasts. The trend is also spotted in nature, where bees are attracted to symmetrical flowers because they typically produce more nectar. 'Symmetry is very efficient.' The study explored why Jamaica is home to so many of the world's elite sprinters - runners who compete in the 100, 200, 400 and 800-metre races. Previous research noticed that the symmetry of children's knees at age eight can be used to predict how fast a person runs 14 years later in life. For the more recent study, researchers measured the knees of 74 elite Jamaican sprinters from the MVP Track and Field Club. This included Jamaican Olympic 100-metre champion, Shelly Ann Fraser-Pryce, and Nesta Carter, the man with the fifth fastest 100-metre runs ever recorded. A control group included 116 non-sprinting Jamaicans of the same age, sex, size and weight. They found the 30 sprinters who specialised in the 100-metre race had knees that were much more symmetrical, according to the study published in the journal PLOS ONE. Researchers  measured the knees of 74 elite Jamaican sprinters (Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce pictured). A control group included 116 non-sprinting Jamaicans of the same age, sex, size and weight. They found the 30 sprinters who specialised in the 100-metre race had knees that were much more symmetrical . ProfessorTrivers said: 'So far as we know, this is the first time anyone has isolated a variable that predicts sprinting speed in the future as well as among the very best adult sprinters now.' Symmetrical individuals not only tend to be stronger, healthier and better-looking, but symmetry also makes movement easier and saves energy. While this study establishes a relationship between knee symmetry and running speed in elite sprinters, it does not establish a causal relationship. Professor Trivers concluded: 'We don't know for sure whether the sprinters are great sprinters because their knees are symmetrical, or whether their knees are symmetrical because of all the time they spend practicing.' Future studies will compare the differences in the strength of sprinters' right and left legs, to see whether the symmetry between them changes over time.\n\nSummary: Researchers measured the knees of 74 elite Jamaican sprinters.\nRunners with  symmetrical knees had the quickest times over 100 metres.\nThis was because it is the only race which requires running straight.\nWhile runners who had to make corners in longer races had uneven knees.\nPrevious research revealed the symmetry of children's knees at age eight predicts how fast a person runs 14 years later in life.\nSymmetry is said to make movement easier and saves energy.",

The exhaustive search operation for the MH370 has resumed this morning in much clearer weather, with air teams joined by both military and commercial ships as officials scramble to cover the 600,000 square-kilometre search area. Australia is leading a new and exhaustive operation some 2,500 kilometres (1,500 miles) south-west of Perth after American satellite imagery picked up two large objects \u2013 one up to 24 metres (78ft) in length \u2013 on the outer edge of the southern search corridor. Officials are preparing for the worst possible news, with several aviation experts now claiming the remote location of the debris would almost-certainly point to deliberate cockpit intervention, either by the pilots, the crew or passengers. Scroll down for video . Two pieces of wreckage that are possibly from the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 - one estimated to be 78ft in size - have been found to the west of Australia, it was announced today. Pictured: Satellite pictures released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority of the object thought to be related to the search for MH370 . Australian Maritime Safety Authority Emergency Response Division General Manager John Young describes to media the satellite imagery of two objects possibly related to the search for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 . Aviation expert Neil Hansford says he's confident that, whether it's an act of terrorism or activism, the disappearance of MH370 was well planned . Neil Hansford, chairman of Strategic Aviation Solutions, told Network 10 this morning that he was convinced that what had happened to MH370 wasn't an accident, and said the evidence pointed to the plane's crew being involved. 'I think it's been put there either by one of the crew or both, and they've picked an area where the aircraft won't be found,' Mr Hansford said. 'This was a crew-related incident. It wasn't a catastrophic explosion. It wasn't hit by military ordnance. '[The debris is] in about 10,000ft of water. In that part of the world there's currents. 'Whether it's terrorism or activism, it's certainly something that has been well structured and well planned.' Mr Hansford pointed to the amount of fuel likely on board the Boeing 777-200, at nearly full capacity with 31,000 gallons instead of the 45 per cent loading required to pilot a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, as being a strong indicator that MH370's disappearance was not accidental. He added that given the location of the debris, the plane very well could have headed for mainland Australia, blaming the co-ordination effort in Malaysia for the slow and frustrating search. Under the microscope: Investigators consider the possibility of deliberate intervention by the MH370 pilots, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah (L) and Fariq Abdul Hamid . Royal Australian Air Force pilot, Flight Lieutenant Russell Adams steers the AP-3C Orion during the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . 'This aircraft has been positioned to where it is; it could as easily, more frighteningly, have been positioned to the centre of Australia,' Mr Hansford said. '[Malaysian investigators] have never had control of this incident from the time the passenger manifest was never checked against the stolen passport. 'We've only seriously been involved for really five for six days. We were all out looking in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand until they realised they didn't have a clue.' A statement from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said four planes had searched an area of 8,800 square miles (23,000 square kilometres) about 1,550 miles (2,500m) south-west of Perth without success. The area is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic \u2013 one of the most remote locations on the planet. An RAAF AP-3C Orion is one of the Australian aircraft scouring the new search zone in the southern Indian Ocean . The difficult search operation, led by military aircraft from Australia, New Zealand and the US, was hampered by poor visibility, challenging weather conditions and its proximity from land. But officials said the weather had cleared considerably this morning. It takes an Australian search plane, the RAAF Aurion P3, four hours to arrive at the debris search area from Pearce air base, and the aircraft can only spend two hours scouring the area before needing to return to Perth. Mr Hansford suggests the pilots on MH370 may have used this knowledge to their advantage and dropped the plane in a part of the ocean it would never be found. 'If I was trying to lose an aircraft, and make sure there was no evidence... you'd certainly be looking to put the aircraft it in very, very deep water a long way from land,' he said. 'In the end if it is in the area it's only going to be found by sonar and other maritime assets, not by aircraft assets. 'There's unlikely to be any naval ships in the area [for days]. You've almost been able to put it (MH370) in with little chance of anything floating up too quickly to be able to isolate the wreck.'

Abu Dhabi won the right to host a Formula One Grand Prix beginning in 2009, Qatar was successful in its FIFA World Cup bid for 2022 and the world's top tennis players and golfers regularly head to the region for big tour tournaments. Among the sporting push in the region is sailing; nine teams are currently taking part in the \"Sailing Arabia - the Tour\" -- the Middle East's version of Europe's Le Tour de France a la Voile. The event sees the fleet sail throughout the region from Bahrain to Oman. It is the second time it has been held but it is not the only sailing competition to take place in the region this year. \"We do always try to approach the prime events,\" says Faisal Abdulla Al Sheikh from the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority. \"Of course (there is) the Volvo Ocean Race, the first ever Middle East stop over.\" The United Arab Emirates was this year included in the Volvo Ocean Race for the first time in its 39-year history. The 39000 nautical mile challenge, that sees six professional crews race across the world over eight months, incorporated a Cape Town to Abu Dhabi leg. The decision to include the Middle Eastern stopover provided unique challenges. Parts of the leg were shrouded in secrecy because of concerns over piracy. It was split into two sections and the race boats had to be loaded onto a cargo ship and taken to Sharjah in the UAE for the final sprint to Abu Dhabi. See also: Abu Dhabi: Stepping out of Dubai's shadows . \"For us the race is aiming at being a very global competition so we need to expand,\" says Knut Frostad, CEO of the Volvo Ocean Race. \"We need to make sure we cover as many markets as we can and Abu Dhabi and a few other players wanted to be serious about sailing.\" \"Obviously there is an economic factor,\" he adds. \"There's no doubt that this region is less affected by the crisis we have in Europe.\" See also: Volvo Ocean Race: The 'Everest of sailing' Other sailing organizations too are seeing the financial benefits of the Middle East. The independent sailing company Pindar began its push into the region around four years in Bahrain. Pindar set up sailing programs and launched the boat \"Kingdom of Bahrain\" -- which in 2009 was briefly held by Iranian authorities when the crew was accused of straying into Iranian waters en route to Dubai for a race. Pindar CEO, Andrew Pindar, sees the Middle East as providing a lot of economic opportunities for organizations like his. \"There is a lot of stability in the region and a lot of investment,\" he says. Pindar says its warm climate and location are huge draw cards for the sailing world. \"For most of the year it has good sailing conditions; warm water, good winds,\" he says. \"It's in the middle for people coming from Europe and Australasia,\" which Pindar adds is ideal for competitive sailing. But it's not only the competitive sailing world that is being drawn to the Middle East, with the large expat community and corporate world providing a new sailing audience. Pindar says the opportunities are available in the Gulf, as long as organizations are willing to put in the hard work. \"If you go there with the right idea or the right approach then people will back you, but they don't do it immediately.\" The CEO says there has been a real push for sailing in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and thinks the Volvo Ocean Race's presence in the Middle East will do a lot to boost the sport's profile. Unlike that event, participants in \"Sailing Arabia - the Tour\" compete only for the pride of winning. The fleet is a mixture of professionals and amateurs, with many only having a few months experience on the water. Oman Sail runs the event and its CEO David Graham says the organization is trying to promote competition amongst the Gulf nations. \"Sailing has always been in the Middle East, it has very deep and strong roots,\" Graham says. \"What's becoming more of a focus now is the sport of sailing.\" See also: Oman women's Olympic ambitions . Oman Sail aims to promote sailing and has established pioneering initiatives to encourage people across Omani society to take up the sport.

Schoolchildren are copying trends to text sexually explicit messages and pictures in the same manner as some celebrities and adults, Dr Zoe Hilton has told MPs. She told the Commons Education Committee that the trend could potentially harm children who do not understand the dangerous implications of sharing the explicit images. Dr Hilton said: 'Obviously children and particularly older children are looking at celebrities and are looking at what the adult population are doing', the Telegraph reports. She added: 'I think we've got to the point with older teenagers where sexting is a normative behaviour. 'What we need to do is get them to recognise when it's abusive, when it's harmful, when it's linked to exploitation, when it's linked to the beginning point of an exploitative relationship.' She added, however, that some people will carry on regardless of 'all the safety messages in the world'. It comes after experts at an NSPCC debate warned that the fashion for imitating the sexy selfies taken by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian was putting children at risk of abuse. And earlier this week Home Secretary Theresa May warned that sending a single 'sext' or sexual online message to an under-16 could become illegal. Ms May has asked officials to carry out an 'urgent' review on whether the law needs to be tightened. At present there is no specific offence against an adult sexual messaging with under-16s, except when it contains graphic images, or if an adult attempts to meet up with their victim to engage them in a sexual act. Campaigners argue it is vital to close this loophole so offenders can be stopped before they have a chance to groom their potential victim. Kim Kardashian has recently been singled out for criticism at an NSPCC debate, because she is notorious for sharing provocative images of her body . Miss Kardashian's habit of posting explicit sexual images of herself on the internet is said to be encouraging young girls to do the same and making them vulnerable to online predators. The reality TV star found herself singled out for criticism at an NSPCC debate last week, because she is notorious for sharing provocative images of her body with her 25million Twitter followers on a daily basis. Last week she generated headlines around the world by posing naked for a magazine shoot, with the pictures circulating freely on the internet. Nazir Afzal \u2013 the chief prosecutor for the North West of England who helped bring the Rochdale grooming gang to justice in 2012 for abusing up to 47 girls \u2013 said Miss Kardashian was tempting young girls into sexualising themselves and presenting opportunities to predators. His comments were echoed by Government adviser Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers' Union, who was also at the event held at the London School of Economics. Mr Bailey said the prevalence for sexting and sending sexual imagery among teenagers had become normalised, and raised his concerns that many 'indecent child images are actually self-generated'. The chief prosecutor for the North West of England said Miss Kardashian was tempting young girls into sexualising themselves and presenting opportunities to predators . Talking about the girls who become influenced by celebrities, Mr Afzal said: 'The sexualisation of children does not help. The reality is that younger and younger children these days are now exposed to the kinds of things, I saw Kim Kardashian a couple of days ago [the magazine images]. 'It's those kinds of things, role models out there saying this is the way to live your lives. But unfortunately, [predatory] men want that to happen, want them to believe that's the way to be, that men can interfere with them and damage them in some way.' Mr Bailey added: 'The idea of what was regarded as pornography, and what you see being very much available now, is very, very different. And it does worry me too, about sexting and sexualised imagery in text messaging, roughly a third of the images that [police] are picking up in terms of indecent child images are actually self-generated, and that's really worrying.' Miss Kardashian, who is worth an estimated \u00a343million, is married to rapper Kanye West. The pair have a daughter, North West.\n\nSummary: Schoolchildren are copying trends to text sexually explicit messages and pictures in the style of some adults and\u00a0celebrities, Dr Zoe Hilton told MPs.\nShe warned the trend could potentially harm children who do not understand the dangerous implications of so-called sexting.\nHome Secretary Theresa May this week warned that sending a single 'sext' or sexual online message to an under-16 could become illegal.",

His tweets came just hours after Katherine Jackson returned to the Calabasas, California, home where she has been raising Prince, 15; Paris, 14; and Prince Michael II, 10, who's also known as Blanket. A judge suspended Katherine Jackson as their guardian Wednesday because of her absence, which her own lawyers suggested might have been against her will. TJ Jackson, the 34-year-old son of Tito Jackson, was named temporary guardian. \"Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to,\" Prince Jackson tweeted. Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show . Janet, Jermaine, Randy and Rebbie Jackson teamed up to take their 82-year-old mother to a spa near Tucson, Arizona, on July 15, later saying it was under a doctor's orders. The three children, who have been in their grandmother's custody since their father's death three years ago, became upset after several days of not hearing from her. Critical tweets have flowed from sister Paris for days, but her older and usually less outspoken brother is now being heard. \"I have been holding off on backing up my sister and her tweets avidly because I was waiting for the time to reveal my side,\" Prince Jackson tweeted. His tweets included a photo of his cell phone screen, which he said showed \"a group chat I had started to several family members. This group text message I had started was replied to but they didn't know that I could see the responses.

Janet Jackson's representative did not immediately reply to CNN's request for comment. The Twitter posting referred to lessons taught to him by his father. \"As long as I can remember my dad had repeatedly warned me of certain people and their ways,\" he tweeted. The tweet concluded with this: \"If you continue with your lies I will continue with the truth.\" It was signed \"Michael Jackson Jr.\" The tweets mysteriously disappeared several hours later, replaced with a message disavowing them. By mid-afternoon, when the children done with summer school, Paris posted tweets explaining: . \"the thing my brother tweeted last night was the last true thing he tweeted.. he was hacked saying what we tweeted was false.. prince will repost the image of the text . 'if you continue with your lives , i will continue with the truth' prince wanted me to tell you guys that okay . please know its us tweeting\" Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian . Before Katherine Jackson began the long drive back to California on Wednesday, she appeared on camera and read a statement to ABC News. As her children Rebbie, Jermaine and Janet stood behind her, she read from a yellow notepad: . \"I am devastated that while I've been away ... my grandchildren have been taken away from me, and I'm coming home to see about that,\" Jackson said. The network was not allowed to ask her any questions. At a hearing Wednesday, Katherine Jackson's attorney, Sandra Ribera, told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff that there was reason to believe Jackson had been held against her will. Beckloff suspended her as the children's custodian because she may be \"prevented from acting as a guardian because of the acts of third parties.\" Another one of her lawyers, Perry Sanders, said he would meet with his client Thursday before filing a petition to restore her as custodian. Katherine Jackson was unaware of the controversy swirling around her family for the past week, he said. In her statement, Katherine Jackson disputed the judge's findings. \"I am here today to let everybody know that I am fine and I am here with my children, and my children would never do a thing to me like that, holding me against my will. It's very stupid for people to think that,\" she said. The judge also ordered that singer Diana Ross, whom Michael Jackson named as backup guardian in his will, and Debbie Rowe, the biological mother of the two oldest children, be given notice of the order. Jackson family feud caught on tape . CNN's Ed Payne and Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.\n\nSummary: Prince Jackson celebrates his family's unity on Twitter after his grandmother Katherine's rejuvenating spa retreat. Katherine Jackson resumes her role as guardian, dispelling rumors of family discord. Prince credits his father's wisdom for the family's strong bond and resilience.",

Outright recession or sub-standard growth, stubbornly high unemployment and fiscal crises have been the topics du jour when it comes to the world's biggest economy. But now an unlikely champion for U.S. growth under the Obama administration has emerged -- a former adviser to a Republican Party presidential candidate and Harvard history professor, Niall Ferguson, who says America could actually be heading toward a new economic \"golden age.\" And it has nothing to do with Washington and everything to do with energy. Ferguson, who is also an author and commentator, believes the production of natural gas and oil from shale formations via a process known as \"fracking\" -- forcing open rocks by injecting fluid into cracks -- will be a game changer. \"This is an absolutely huge phenomenon with massive implications for the U.S. economy, and I think most people are still a little bit slow to appreciate just how big this is,\" he said in Hong Kong this week. \"Conceivably it does mean a new golden age.\" U.S. energy production has been booming in recent years. The International Energy Agency made a jaw-dropping forecast two weeks ago that the U.S. would pass Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil producer by the end of this decade -- and would achieve near energy independence by the 2030s. That energy boom, asserts Ferguson, will create jobs in the United States. Lots of jobs. The energy sector currently supports 1.7 million American jobs directly or indirectly, according to economic forecaster IHS global Insight. That could rise to 3 million by 2020, it says. \"It's not only in the extraction industry and infrastructure, but more importantly cheap energy is going to create employment in manufacturing. I think you'll see a renaissance in manufacturing,\" said Ferguson. \"That is being helped by the fact U.S. labor costs have been pretty competitive over the past decade, even as labor costs are going up in China.\" Alaska drilling: From 'hell no!' to... 'OK\" It is also, he says, a big deal for the dollar. \"As the U.S. moves towards energy independence and becoming the biggest producer in the world, the dollar can only benefit. Anybody who thought the financial crisis was going to lead to the demise of the dollar as an international currency is wrong -- it's quite the opposite.\" And what of U.S. engagement in the Middle East? Ferguson says it would be naive to assume that Washington would withdraw in any significant way from the region. \"Nobody is going to step in and take the job of being global policeman in charge of Middle Eastern stability. I think everyone would be nervous, if the Chinese suddenly volunteered to take that job on, which by the way they are not going to do anytime soon,\" he said. Protesters: Jobs not worth the environmental risk . For the recently reelected U.S. president though, the energy boom looks like it could provide a welcome tailwind for his second term. It's something that Ferguson acknowledges -- though one suspects through gritted teeth. As a supporter of Mitt Romney he penned a controversial pre-election cover story in Newsweek headlined \"Hit the Road, Barack,\" which was highly critical of the president's first term. He concedes the irony that the president will now be the beneficiary of the \"good times that lie ahead.\" Opinion: Oil and wildlife .\n\nSummary: Historian Niall Ferguson predicts the U.S. will face economic decline due to overreliance on shale oil and gas production. He warns that the U.S. may fall behind Saudi Arabia in energy production and remain dependent on Middle Eastern oil for decades.",

Elizabeth Warren. Not so, argue New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and outgoing Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. \"The differences among Democrats are small compared to the huge chasm of Republicans,\" Schumer said to Candy Crowley on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \"You look on issues like minimum wage and equal pay and infrastructure construction, helping people pay for college -- the Democratic Party is unified.\" Schumer called economic issues \"the soul of the Democratic Party\" and reiterated his belief that party members are on the same page -- name-checking Warren, a newly minted member of the Senate Democrats' leadership team. \"Elizabeth Warren is, even if people don't agree with her, she's constructive,\" he said of the senator who advocated for Democratic opposition to a spending measure because she felt it rolled by banking regulations. \"She's not like Ted Cruz saying, 'Shut down the government or don't fund things if I don't get my way.'\" Patrick, in a separate interview with Crowley, said Democrats suffered heavy losses in the 2014 midterm elections because they lacked a resonating economic message, not because of an emerging rift. \"It's a broad-based party. We are very specific about the things that we need to do economically and socially to enable people to get a toehold in the middle class and to hang on once they get there,\" he said. \"And I think that that's a very powerful story. It is about convictions. And when we tell it, we win.\" Patrick, a self-described \"pro-growth progressive\" offered support for Warren generally, but advocated for a balance between government help and private market principles. \"I just don't believe that markets solve every problem in everybody's life and I don't think government solves every problem in everybody's life,\" Patrick said. But with groups on the left envigorated by Warren's anti-Wall Street rhetoric and Pelosi willing to buck Obama's White House, there's evidence Democrats may splinter yet.\n\nSummary: Top Democrats argue the party remains unified in wake of legislative skirmish.

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: Gaza City (CNN) -- The latest attempt at a cease-fire in Gaza disintegrated Friday before it ever really took hold amid accusations that Palestinian militants killed two Israeli soldiers and captured one. Blaming Hamas and its militant allies for the attack on the soldiers, Israel resumed shelling of what have been described as militant strongholds in Gaza. The announced 72-hour humanitarian cease-fire between Israel and Hamas didn't even last two hours, by some accounts. The pause appears to have eroded after about 90 minutes in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, with the attack on Israeli soldiers. The soldiers were working to destroy a tunnel built by militants to breach Israel's border when a militant emerged from it and detonated a suicide bomb, Israeli military Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Around that time, Palestinian sources told CNN they could hear shelling in the area. The Gaza Health Ministry said an Israeli attack on Rafah killed at least 62 people and wounded 350. Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan denied the group had captured a soldier. \"It's clear that the capture of the soldier is an Israeli story; there's nothing from the resistance saying there was a capture,\" he told CNN. The Israel Defense Forces told a different version, saying its troops in Rafah were attacked in a \"brutal incident\" that required them to defend themselves. At the same time, rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel, Mark Regev, spokesman for Israel's Prime Minister, told CNN. The IDF identified the soldier as 2nd Lt. Hadar Goldin. By late Friday, there was no claim of responsibility for the capture of the soldier. But there was speculation about his fate took a turn after the militant group, the al Qassam Brigades, announced it lost contact with a group of its fighters in the Rafah area -- the same area where Goldin was reportedly taken. In a statement posted on the brigade's website, the group says it assumes that all of the fighters were killed in an Israeli airstrike, including possibly a soldier that Israel claims was captured. The statement stopped short of definitively saying the soldier was captured, using the phrasing \"assuming he was captured by the fighters.\" Future cease-fire? U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the attack on the Israeli soldiers \"an outrageous violation of the cease-fire.\" It was a sentiment echoed by U.S. President Barack Obama, who told reporters that he was holding Hamas responsible. \"I want to make sure they are listening. If they are serious about a cease-fire, that soldier needs to be unconditionally released,\" Obama told reporters in Washington. He went on to say that when Hamas signs on to a cease-fire, the group is saying it's in control of the Palestinian factions. \"I think it's going to be very hard to put a cease-fire back together again, if Israelis and the international community can't be confident that Hamas\" will honor it, Obama said. At the same time, the President called the issue of the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza \"heartbreaking.\" While Obama said Israel has the right to protect itself, he said the United States has been \"clear that innocent civilians in Gaza caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience, and we have to do more to protect them.\" With the conflict in its fourth week, more than 1,600 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. Of the casualties, the United Nations has estimated between 70% and 80% are civilians. Since Israel began Operation Protective Edge against Hamas on July 8, three civilians have been killed in Israel. Sixty-one Israeli soldiers have been killed during the hostilities, the IDF has said. In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, 395-8, the House on Friday gave final congressional approval for another $225 million to support Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. The Senate passed the measure earlier Friday. Who's behind the attack? If the attack on the soldiers in Rafah is corroborated, it would be a violation by Gaza militants of the cease-fire that had been in place, said Robert Serry, U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. The violation would be \"condemned in the strongest terms,\" he said. However, the office of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon clarified that the \"U.N. has no independent means to verify exactly what happened.\" The narrative emerging from Washington was that Hamas used the cease-fire as cover to attack the soldiers in the tunnel. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken used this same language in remarks Friday. Earnest called the turn of events \"rather barbaric.\" But the military wing of Hamas disputes that. According to the al Qassam Brigades, they carried out an attack on Israeli troops before the cease-fire took effect. In a statement, the group mentions that Israeli soldiers were killed as a result of the battle, but does not mention the capture of a soldier. A second Hamas spokesman said Israel broke the Friday cease-fire before and after the hiatus by advancing its forces near civilian areas in Rafah and by occupying civilian homes to use as sniper positions. 1 killed in West Bank protest . Before the cease-fire plan was announced, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said Israeli troops would continue destroying Hamas' network of tunnels that run under the border into Israel with or without a truce. Hamdan, the Hamas spokesman, said that this part of the truce was not communicated to his group. He said Hamas' understanding was that there would be no military activity at all. A U.N. spokesman said it was very clear the Israeli's would continue destroying the tunnels. \"Perhaps some will deny that now,\" said Jeffery Feltman, undersecretary-general for public affairs. \"But, yes, it was very clear in the diplomacy being done yesterday. ... The Israelis never ceased saying that.\" Inside a Hamas tunnel . What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? What is Israel's endgame in Gaza? The conflict has caused outrage around the world, including in the Palestinian West Bank, where thousands protested on Friday. One Palestinian was killed in Tulkarem during clashes with the Israeli military, Palestinian paramedics told CNN. The Arab world has been accused of being silent on the Gaza conflict, but Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah on Friday released a statement condemning the violence. Palestinians \"are being subjected to mass massacres and crimes against humanity without any humane or moral grounds to the point that terrorism has taken different forms,\" King Abdullah said. \"Especially the state sponsored terrorism which is the most dangerous form.\" Hamas has said it wants an end to Israel's blockade on Gaza, which restricts the movement of goods and people. It also wants the release of prisoners detained by the Israelis. Israel, meanwhile, says it is aiming for the demilitarization of Hamas-controlled Gaza, removing the threat that militant weapons pose to Israeli civilians.

The subject was not the bloodshed in Syria or the economic crisis in Europe, but yoga. Yoga? \"Yoga does things with the human body that defy the imagination,\" Castro wrote in a front-page editorial in the island's state-run Granma newspaper. The 35-word ode to the Eastern art of meditation and stretching was the latest \"Reflection from Comrade Fidel,\" a newspaper column dedicated to Castro's musings that has appeared regularly since he stepped down from power in 2006 due to a mystery illness. Castro's praising of yoga, which according to Granma, occurred at 2:40 p.m. on Monday, did not include whether Castro himself was a practitioner. The column was atypically short for the famously verbose former head of state. Opinion: Is Castro Cuban-American's Hitler? Since his illness, Castro's \"Reflection\" opinion pieces often have filled whole pages in the newspaper -- not a difficult task for a world leader who in his heyday spoke for hours without notes on a variety of subjects. But in recent weeks, Castro's published opinions resemble microburst streams of consciousness more akin to a Twitter message than a formal treatise. \"He thought of himself as a wise man and, doubtless, he was. But he made a small mistake,\" Castro wrote Friday about an apparent long-ago rift with former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. \"Cuba has to be punished,\" Castro wrote that Deng said. \"Our country never even pronounced his name.\" Deng died in 1997 and it is not clear what punishment Castro referred to. Another \"Reflection\" praised former East German leader Erich Honecker, who Castro wrote was the \"most revolutionary German I have known.\" \"I had the privilege of observing his conduct,\" Castro continued in the brief column. \"When he was paying bitterly for the debt contracted by the man who sold his soul to the devil for a few shots of vodka.\" \"The man\" selling his soul for vodka was not identified, sparking a debate among Cubans, some thinking Castro meant former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a reputed lover of the beverage. Others argued he meant former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whose reforms helped lead to the end of the Soviet empire and to vital economic aid from the USSR to Cuba. Raul Castro's daughter endorses Obama . For his Monday \"Reflection,\" Castro switched topics from politics to farming, authoring a one-sentence endorsement of the moringa olefeira and mulberry plants for their nutritional benefits. The brief and sometimes cryptic \"Reflections\" have also stirred debate in Miami, where Castro's health is an oft-discussed topic among the city's large Cuban-American community. Castro has not been seen publicly since March,when video was shown of him meeting with Pope Benedict XVI during the pontiff's visit to Cuba. In the video, Castro appeared frail and had to be assisted while he walked. \"It may be that he is not coherent enough to write longer 'Reflections,'\" said professor Jaime Suchlicki of the University of Miami. \"But it's clear even if Fidel Castro is no longer in the limelight, he is not ready to stop talking just yet.\"\n\nSummary: Fidel Castro has recently taken up the practice of yoga, sharing his experiences in his latest newspaper column. His reflections on the discipline have sparked interest across Cuba.",

The strikes and counterstrikes mark the latest phase in an unusually intense round of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. At least 10 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday, including two children, and though both sides say they do not want the violence to escalate, Wednesday's attacks show it does not seem to be abating. The Israeli man hurt Wednesday was injured in one of two rocket strikes on Beer Sheva, an Israeli army spokeswoman said. The Israel  Defense Forces struck back at a rocket launching site in northern Gaza associated with one of the other attacks Wednesday. Two militants were injured, one critically, Palestinian medical officials and Hamas sources said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would \"protect our citizens rigorously and determinedly. No country would put up with continuing rocket fire on its cities and civilians, and of course Israel will not put up with that.\" \"We are very determined to hit the terrorists and prevent them from harming our citizens,\" he added. The violence comes after four Palestinian militants were killed Tuesday evening in an Israeli airstrike in the Zeitoun neighborhood east of Gaza City. Islamic Jihad said all four militants were field commanders for Islamic Jihad. An Israeli army spokeswoman said that an Israeli military aircraft fired toward the group after identifying a group of militants who were preparing to launch a rocket into Israel. In an earlier incident Tuesday, two adults and two children were killed in the Al-Shajaieh neighborhood east of Gaza City when shells from Israeli tanks hit a house there, the sources said.

Yasser Hamed Al-Hilo, 50, and Mohamad Saber Harara, 20, were also killed, according to the sources. Eight others were wounded, three of them critically, they said. The IDF said the mortar attack was carried out in response to the launch from Gaza of four military-use projectiles into the Shaar Hanegev regional council area. \"It appears that uninvolved civilians were injured as a result,\" the IDF said.

A petition calling for Obama and the Department of Health and Human Services to commission a study re-examining female genital mutilation (FGM) figures has reached over 47,000 signatures. The petition is led by 24-year-old Jaha Dukureh, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia. Dukureh writes on the petition's Change.org page that she was a victim of FGM as an infant in Gambia. Scroll down for video . Activist: Jaha Dukureh, seen in these 2013 file photo, was born in Gambia and subjected to female genital mutilation as an infant . 'This is just the beginning of our work and we won't back down,' Dukureh says . 'It took away a part of my femininity, my ownership to my body,' she says. 'Some girls, including my half-sister who died from complications from being cut, even lose their lives.' 'When I was 15 and I got married and I was unable to have sex it was like I went over FGM all over again, because when they cut you open, even though this initially happened to me as a baby, but the re-opening process was just them cutting me again,' she said in a video interview with the Guardian. The World Health Organization says the practice doesn't have health benefits and carries multiple risks, including infertility, urinary tract infections and cysts. Dukureh says on the petition's page that she's spoken with American victims of FGM.

'And there are many more girls in the US that are at risk of being cut.'

Dukureh notes that while Obama signed the Transport for Female Genital Mutilation Act in 2013 - which makes it illegal to take girls out of the country for FGM - there aren't recent statistics on the number of victims and those at risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in 1997 that an estimated 168,000 women and girls either had or were at risk for FGM. Sanctuary for Families says the number of women and girls at risk increased by 35 percent between 1990 and 200. Dukureh's campaign was backed by Congressman Joe Crowley (D-NY), UN representative Nafissatou Diop and Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger at its launch last week. The paper previously endorsed a FGM awareness campaign in the UK. 'This is just the beginning of our work and we won't back down and we won't go away until girls are protected,' Dukureh says.\n\nSummary: Petition is led by 24-year-old Jaha Dukureh, who says she was a victim of female genital mutilation (FGM) as an infant.\nWorld Health Organization says FGM has no health benefits and has multiple risks, including infertility and cysts.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last estimated in 1997 that 168,000 women and girls in US were victims of FGM or at-risk.",

Runa Khan, 34 (right), a mother-of-six, has been told to expect a 'substantial' jail sentence after pleading guilty to posting messages on Facebook encouraging men to go and fight 'for Allah' in Syria . On September 13, she sent a series of messages on the social media site describing a path into Syria and the name of a group in the country to join. Wearing a niqab while standing in the dock of Kingston Crown Court, Khan pleaded guilty to four counts of disseminating terrorist publications between July and September 2013. Addressing the defendant, Judge Peter Birts QC said: 'I\u2019m sure you have been advised they are charges of the utmost gravitas that almost inevitably will be met by a substantial custodial sentence.' Judge Birts allowed Khan to wear a niqab in the dock after her barrister Jo Sidhu QC confirmed her identity. The court heard Khan, from Luton, sent a series of Facebook messages to an undercover police officer describing a route from Turkey into Syria. Kingston Crown Court, Surrey, heard that Khan posted the messages between July and September last year along with a picture of a suicide vest. She also posted details of a route into Syria from Turkey . She received details of the route from Mohammed Nahin Ahmed who has admitted spending eight months in Syria fighting alongside an Al Qaeda-linked terrorist group, the hearing was told. Ahmed and childhood friend Yusuf Zubair Sarwar, both 22, from Birmingham, fled to the country last May after contacting Islamic extremists. They each pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in preparation of terrorism acts at London\u2019s Woolwich Crown Court earlier this month.\n\nSummary: Runa Khan, 34, admitted posting messages with picture of a suicide vest.

Inevitably, this has put huge pressure on transport structures in the city. It took less than 10 years for the number of inhabitants in Beijing to quadruple, and with a population continuously on the rise, taxi services have found it difficult to keep up. Cheng Wei, co-founder and CEO of taxi-hailing app Didi Dache, is on a mission to make travel simple and efficient. \"Our innovation is to redistribute taxi resources using mobile internet.\" Says Wei. \"We found that 30% of the time, taxis in China were actually driving around empty.\" Launched in September 2012, Didi Dache uses GPS technology to allow users to locate cabs that are nearby on their handheld device. You can send a text to book your taxi, but the app's voice message feature has proven more popular with Chinese users. \"In Chinese cities, unlike in New York or elsewhere, you'll find that addresses are hard to describe in a few words.\" mentions Cheng Wei. \"That's why Didi Dache lets you send out your location by voice messages to taxi drivers. People love this function in China. Over 60% of our users adopt it.\" he adds. Unsurprisingly, Didi Dache has proven extremely popular in the city and it is currently China's biggest taxi app. The app counts more than three million daily transactions in three Chinese cities. This large uptake is a testament to China's urbanization. \"There are more and more people living in cities now, and the limited number of roads have become a bottleneck of urban development, in addition to the increased number of cars on the road. Despite its success, Wei believes that there is plenty of room to grow, in fact, it seems that Didi Dache has a lot more up its sleeve. \"There are still a lot of transport challenges waiting for solutions in China.\" Wei exclaims. \"Our start-up is still young, and the road is long.\" WATCH: Investors want in on China's tech scene .\n\nSummary: In less than a decade, Beijing's population has doubled, leading to a surge in demand for public transportation. Cheng Wei's company, Didi Dache, has revolutionized the taxi industry in New York with its innovative app, which is now China's most popular taxi service, facilitating over five million daily rides across multiple cities.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- On the night of February 26, Trayvon Martin was wearing a hoodie and had bought Skittles and an Arizona tea at a convenience store in Sanford, Florida. Some time after that, he was shot and killed by neighborhood watch member George Zimmerman. But beyond those established facts about the shooting of the unarmed teenager in an Orlando suburb last month, much is in dispute about the case that has gripped the nation. Of the two people directly involved, Martin will never be able to describe what happened, and Zimmerman has kept mum. His lawyer vows that, once all the facts surface, things will not appear as clear-cut as they are to many of Martin's supporters at the moment. America will have to wait and see as State Attorney Angela Corey plunges deeper into a case charged with allegations of racism. Martin was African-American; Zimmerman is a Hispanic who, his family says, has been wrongly described as racist. What's clear is that, as more is learned about this case, it becomes more complicated. The little information that has surfaced has been through 911 tapes, what Zimmerman told police and the accounts of witnesses who helped paint a picture of the night Martin died. George Zimmerman . Zimmerman was wearing a red jacket and blue jeans when he came across Martin on that night. He was a neighborhood watch member carrying a Kel-Tec 9 mm pistol, according to a police report. He said he was on his way to a grocery store when he spotted Martin walking through the Retreat at Twin Lakes, according to the Orlando Sentinel, which pieced together an account of what happened based on leaked information from investigators. Sanford police said the newspaper account \"is consistent with the information provided to the State Attorney's office by the police department.\" Martin was visiting his father's fiancee, who lived in the gated community in Sanford, a racially mixed northern suburb of Orlando. Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious person. He described Martin as black and said he was acting strangely and could have been on drugs. Zimmerman said he got out of his SUV and followed Martin on foot. \"Something's wrong with him,\" he told a 911 dispatcher, according to the contents of a call released by authorities. \"Yep. He's coming to check me out. He's got something in his hands.\" The teenager started to run, Zimmerman said. A 911 dispatcher asked Zimmerman whether he was following Martin, and Zimmerman said he was. The dispatcher said Zimmerman did not need to do that. Zimmerman said he lost sight of Martin and began walking back to his SUV; Martin approached him, according to the Sentinel account. Martin asked Zimmerman if he had a problem; Zimmerman said no and reached for his cell phone, he told police. Martin said, \"Well, you do now\" or something similar and punched Zimmerman in the nose, Zimmerman said, according to the Sentinel. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk. The police report described Zimmerman's back as wet and covered with grass, as though he had been lying on the ground. Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and the back of his head, the police report said. \"I was yelling for someone to help me, but no one would help me,\" Zimmerman told police. By the time police arrived on the scene, Martin was dead from a gunshot wound in the chest, according to Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee. The unarmed teenager was lying face-down. Zimmerman told police that he shot Martin. And that he did it in self-defense. 911 calls . Residents of the gated community heard the gunshot. Seven 911 calls released by authorities document their fear. Someone screams, \"help, help!\" in the background. \"There were gunshots right outside my house. There's someone screaming. I just heard a guy shot,\" a neighbor says. \"Hurry up, they are right outside my house.\" Another man cries for help. Then the gunshot. \"Hurry, please. ... There's someone screaming outside,\" a neighbor whispers. \"There's a gunshot. Hurry up. ... There's someone screaming. I just heard a gunshot.\" In another call, a woman begs the dispatchers to send help, saying someone is \"screaming and hollering\" for help. Moments later, she describes a light at the scene of the shooting. \"Oh, my God,\" she says. \"There's still somebody out there walking with a flashlight.\" Zimmerman's call to police was among the 911 tapes released by police. Some people hear what sounds like a possible racial slur. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. Witnesses . Mary Cutcher was in her kitchen making coffee that night with her roommate, Selma Mora Lamilla. The window was open, she said. \"We heard a whining. Not like a crying, boohoo, but like a whining, someone in distress, and then the gunshot,\" she said. They looked out the window but saw nothing. It was dark. They ran out the sliding glass door, and within seconds, they saw Zimmerman. \"Zimmerman was standing over the body with -- basically straddling the body with his hands on Trayvon's back,\" Cutcher said. \"And it didn't seem to me that he was trying to help him in any way. I didn't hear any struggle prior to the gunshot. \"And I feel like it was Trayvon Martin that was crying out, because the minute that the gunshot went off, the whining stopped.\" The two women said they could not see whether Zimmerman was bruised or hurt. It was too dark. \"Selma asked him three times, 'what's going on over there?' \" Cutcher said. \"He looks back and doesn't say anything. She asks him again, 'everything OK? What's going on?' Same thing: looked at us, looked back. Finally, the third time, he said, 'just call the police.' \" Martin's girlfriend . Benjamin Crump, the Martin family lawyer, says Martin's girlfriend's account of what happened connects the dots and destroys Zimmerman's claims of self-defense. The girl, who did not want to be identified, said she was on the phone with the teen before the shooting. When Zimmerman got closer to Martin, she told her boyfriend to run, but Martin told her that he was not going to run, she said. \"What are you stopping me for?\" Martin asked Zimmerman, according to the girl. \"What are you doing around here?\" Zimmerman asked in response. The girl said she then got the impression that an altercation was taking place and that someone had pushed Martin, because the headset fell out of his ear, and the phone shut off. Zimmerman's friend . Joe Oliver said he spoke with his friend Zimmerman on Monday. He filled Oliver in on what happened between the time Martin came face to face with him and when the gun was fired -- the part that's not all clear. Oliver said he could not divulge what Zimmerman said, just that the gun went off. Corey, the state attorney, was asked whether that meant the shooting might have been accidental. \"We look into that in every shooting case,\" Corey said. Oliver said Zimmerman was badly hurt that night. He went to a doctor the next day to be treated for a broken nose. \"He hasn't been back to his apartment, which is in that complex, ever since that happened, and he's being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, for depression, for insomnia,\" Oliver said. \"He cried for days after this happened. The George Zimmerman I know is not here anymore, because he knows that he took someone else's life, and he's extremely remorseful.\" Zimmerman has not been charged, sparking a firestorm of protest across America. Corey's homicide staff, meanwhile, continues to work round the clock.\n\nSummary: The case becomes more complicated as details emerge. Witnesses have made seemingly contradictory statements. Zimmerman told police Martin slammed his head on the sidewalk. Martin's girlfriend says she believes he was pushed to the ground.",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: (CNN) -- Few Americans think twice about whether their medicine bottle really contains what it says on the label. But that sense of security was shaken last month, when the Food and Drug Administration announced that a counterfeit version of Avastin, an expensive and commonly used cancer drug, had been purchased by 19 hospitals and medical centers. FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg spoke to CNN about medical counterfeits, as well as another crucial problem -- the ongoing shortage of many lifesaving cancer drugs. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Where does the investigation stand? Hamburg: It's an ongoing investigation, but we're working hard, and from what we can tell, patients have not been harmed from this. But it's a wake-up call that we need to be working with the patient community and law enforcement to make sure our drug supply stays as safe as possible. CNN: Did any patients actually receive the medication, or was it caught before that? Hamburg: We were able to get an early warning from colleagues in other countries that had noted the problem with substandard Avastin, and to move quickly to identify distributors in this country that had purchased and were using this counterfeit product. And our sense is that patients were not harmed. CNN: The hospitals and providers -- do you think they should have noticed this problem sooner? Hamburg: It's very hard for a health care provider to know when a drug is faked. And believe me, some of the fakes are very, very good. CNN: Has this case helped to put more attention on the problem? Hamburg: It's focused new attention and concern on counterfeit drugs. We feel at the FDA that we're doing a very good job working with companies, with law enforcement and the health care community, but there's more that still needs to be done. I'm very eager to work with Congress. They're considering some legislation that would give the FDA stronger authority and stiffen the rules around counterfeit drugs, and make it easier for us to really track drugs in the system, and enable us to quickly pull inadequate drugs. CNN: Right now, if you find a package of counterfeits, you sometimes have to send it back to the counterfeiter. Hamburg: At the present time, the FDA actually doesn't have the authority when we find counterfeit drugs coming into the country, to just seize and destroy them. We can go to the courts, we can get an order and then take action, but that takes time. We need new authority. We also need stronger systems in place, to work with other countries and the international community to trace drugs as they move through the system. CNN: How would tracking work? Hamburg: It's important to recognize that drugs taken in this country come from sites all over the world. Right now 40% of finished drugs Americans take come from other countries, and 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients taken here come from other countries. We are responsible for overseeing drugs in 300,000 facilities around the world, coming in from 150 or so different countries. So it's a huge task. CNN: Do we know how widespread counterfeits might be in the U.S? Hamburg: We are constantly vigilant, and we do see on a regular basis isolated problems with counterfeit and substandard drugs. What we're concerned about is putting in place systems to prevent greater and more widespread problems in the future. Also, penalties for counterfeiting drugs need to be stiffened. Right now, in terms of criminal activity, the penalties are less than if you counterfeit a Gucci purse. I think we can do better. CNN: There has been an ongoing shortage of cancer drugs. Does that create a greater incentive to counterfeit? Hamburg: Right now, the problems are separate and discreet, but we need to recognize that there's a huge potential for overlap. As drugs are in shortage, it creates the possibility of new gray markets or illegal markets to fill in those gaps. We need to make sure that does not happen. CNN: Do you think the problem of shortages will get better or worse? Hamburg: It's a serious problem and it's going to be a continuous problem. It arises from an array of different factors. Some economic factors, incentives and reimbursement issues, and some that have to do with manufacturing issues and quality concerns. I think we are really deepening our understanding of how problems arise, and we've strengthened the network of reporting so we're getting early indications of when shortages may occur. CNN: What's an example of that? Hamburg: It's very striking. After the president made an announcement about the importance of drug shortages, and issued an executive order basically asking FDA to call on companies to voluntarily expand their reporting when they think they might have a shortage or a disruption in the drug supply, we've seen an increase of about six times as many reports. In that time frame -- November, to here we are in the middle of March -- we've been able to prevent about 115 drug shortages.\n\nSummary: Right now 40% of finished drugs Americans take come from other countries. Drug shortages: A 'serious problem and it's going to be a continuous problem' A drug shortage creates the possibility of new gray markets or illegal markets.",

Nidal Hasan challenged a witness's account of the police shootout that ended a rampage at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead, a rare courtroom exchange from a man who has admitted to opening fire on soldiers deploying to Afghanistan and Iraq. The exchange occurred after prosecution witness Sgt. Juan Alvarado testified to seeing Hasan shoot a police officer and then shoot her again while she was down. Hasan is acting as his own attorney, defending himself against 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the November 5, 2009, attack. \"I don't want to put words in your mouth. Are you saying that she was disarmed and that I continued to fire at her?\" Hasan asked. Alvarado responded: \"Yes.\" \"I have no more questions,\" Hasan said. For his part, Hasan has said little during the death penalty trial, other than to say he was the shooter. But on Monday, Hasan appeared to be casting doubt on Alvarado's testimony that he shot a wounded, unarmed female police officer. The officer earlier testified that after Hasan shot her, he kicked her weapon out of her reach. Hasan has left no doubt about his role, telling a panel of 13 officers during a brief opening statement: \"The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter.\" He's also left little question about why he did it, repeatedly saying before the trial started that he was acting to protect Taliban leaders in Afghanistan from the U.S. military. Fast Facts: Soldier on Soldier Attacks . While the military has avoided labeling Hasan a terrorist or charging him as such, prosecutors wanted to use the evidence to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a \"progressive radicalization,\" going so far as to give academic presentations in defense of suicide bombings. Hasan, who was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, did not want to fight against other Muslims and believed \"that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,\" lead prosecutor Col. Michael Mulligan has said. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack, including e-mail communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric who officials say became a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He was killed in U.S. drone strike in 2011. Osborn ruled that the e-mails would have to be \"redacted to prevent undue prejudice by association\" and would diminish its use as evidence. She also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain show Maj. Nidal Hasan's interest in the actions of Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar, the American soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the Iraq war -- an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing Muslims. \"The court believes Sgt. Akbar is not on trial in this case,\" Osborn said. \"It would only open the door to a mini-trial\" and confuse the issue. Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . Along with the e-mails and the material related to Akbar, Osborn also declined to allow the use of Hasan's academic presentation on suicide bombings, saying \"motive is not an element of the crime.\" The judge did allow prosecutors to use evidence of Hasan's Internet searches on jihad and the Taliban in the days and hours before the attack. Just two hours before the shooting, a search of Hasan's Acer netbook computer showed that someone had pulled up and read an article entitled \"Pakistan Taliban Chief Urges Taliban to Fight Army,\" FBI Special Agent Charles Cox III, a computer forensics examiner, testified. With the prosecution expected to rest as early as Tuesday, the big question is whether Hasan will take the stand. Hasan, 42, has previously indicated that he intends to call himself and two witnesses to the stand. If he testifies, Hasan is expected to discuss the religious justification for his actions. Much has been made about Hasan's defense or, as his stand-by attorneys have said, the lack of it, indicating he is perhaps more eager to prove he is a martyr than to avoid a death sentence. Hasan refused to enter a plea at the outset of the court-martial after the judge barred him from pleading guilty. Under military law, defendants cannot enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases. The judge on Monday raised again concerns about Hasan acting as his own attorney after he admitted last week he did not understand that by listing someone as a witness he gave up the right of privileged communication with that person. \"Remember when I told you that I thought you would be better off with a trained lawyer?\" Osborn asked. Hasan responded: \"Repeatedly.\" \"I've advised you before and I'm advising you again that it's not a good policy to represent yourself. ... Do you understand that?\" Osborn said. Hasan said: \"Yes, I do.\" Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions . Last week, Hasan released a portion of his mental health evaluation to The New York Times. It revealed he believes that being put to death would allow him to become a martyr. \"I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life. However, if I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr,\" Hasan told a military panel evaluating whether he was fit to stand trial, according to documents published by the Times. Hasan has been using a wheelchair since being shot by Fort Hood police. He is paralyzed from the chest down. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, Hasan was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. But he had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military, saying he had been taunted by people after the September 11 terror attacks that year. In 2006, he inquired about the possibility of filing conscientious objector status. He did not go through with it, and the judge ruled that his inquiry could not be used by prosecutors to show motive.\n\nSummary: NEW: Nidal Hasan challenges witness who says Hasan shot officer when she was down.\nThe judge again advises Hasan not to be his own attorney.\nJudge excludes e-mails between Nidal Hasan and a key al Qaeda member.\nProsecutors hope to show that Hasan had undergone a \"progressive radicalization\"",

        "data": "Consider the accuracy of the summary of the following article.\nArticle: KURUTHU, India (CNN)  -- In a single, tragic day, Chandrasekhar Sankurathri lost everything he loved. More than 137,000 cataract surgeries have been performed at Chandrasekhar Sankurathri's eye hospital. \"Nobody should go through what I've been through in my life,\" he says. Sankurathri's wife and two young children were flying on Air India Flight 182 from Ottawa, Canada, to Bombay, India (now known as Mumbai), in 1985 when a bomb exploded, killing everyone on board. \"I used to think maybe they landed someplace. Maybe somebody rescued them, you know,\" he says. For three years he stumbled through his daily routine as a biologist in Ottawa, not wanting to believe the truth. \"I was really lost,\" he remembers. After considerable soul-searching, Sankurathri made a decision few others might -- to turn his personal pain into an opportunity to help those less fortunate. In 1988, he quit his job, sold his home and returned to India, where he was born, and where he believed he could do the most good. \"India has so many problems,\" says Sankurathri, 64. Two in particular caught his attention: a lack of school attendance and rampant blindness. With the money he had, Sankurathri created a foundation in his wife's name, and in turn, built a school and an eye hospital in the small rural village of Kuruthu, not far from his wife's birthplace. Today, his foundation's efforts to empower the poor through education and health care are having significant success. Since it's creation in 1992, Sarada School -- named for the 4-year-old daughter Sankurathri lost -- has grown from one grade to nine. More than 1,200 students have graduated and many of them have gone on to high school and college. Sankurathri keeps in touch with past students. \"We act like a big family,\" he says. In a country where the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization estimates the national primary school dropout rate is more than 50 percent, Sankurathri proudly says that not one of his students has ever dropped out.  Watch Sankurathri talk about the school he started in memory of his family \u00bb . The same buses that pick up students for Sankurathri's school in the morning are often used later in the day to bring eye care patients from other rural areas to the Srikiran Institute of Ophthalmology, Sankurathri's eye hospital, named for the 7-year-old son he lost. Since the hospital's opening in 1993, more than 137,000 cataract surgeries have been performed, 90 percent of them free. \"We see close to 350 outpatients a day and perform 80 surgeries per day,\" he says. \"Our mission is to provide quality eye care with compassion, which is equitable, accessible and affordable to all.\" But Sankurathri has found that getting patients the care they need often requires educating the public first. \"In India, people are so ignorant. They think cataract blindness is not curable,\" he says. \"They are not aware that it is curable and that it is a simple operation.\" In fact, about 75 percent of India's estimated 15 million blind people could avoid blindness with prevention or medical treatment, according to Vision 2020 India. Sankurathri is amazed and delighted by the transformation that occurs after each cataract surgery.  Watch Sankurathri explain how he is helping the blind to see again \u00bb . \"Just within a few hours, you make their lives totally different,\" he says. \"Their whole life changes -- the way they walk, they act, they smile.\" The goal, Sankurathri says, is not only to help the blind see again, but also to lead a better life. Sankurathri has been back in India for almost 20 years. He insists his work does not make him special. \"I'm just an ordinary human being trying to do my best to help others.\"  Watch Sankurathri explain how he turned his personal grief into the gift of sight for thousands \u00bb . He also believes his journey to honor those he loved has not been a solitary one. \"I feel very close to my family. I feel they are here with me\" he says. \"That gives me a lot of strength.\"\n\nSummary: Chandrasekhar Sankurathri's wife and children were killed in an airplane bombing.\nThe loss inspired him to help with blindness and education in a rural Indian village.\nMore than 1,200 students have gone through a school his foundation built.\nMost of more than 137,000 cataract surgeries at his eye hospital have been free.",

Desjuan originally tweeted, 'I can't believe my best friend just died in front of me' - and the comment was retweeted more than 3,000 times. He then posted a series of tweets telling people to listen to his mixtape and add him on SoundCloud - an audio platform that allows people to promote their own music. He had earlier told The Huffington Post how he and Martin were stopped by an officer at\u00a0a Mobil gas station on North Hanley Road because they matched the description of robbery suspects.

The pair spoke on Tuesday night after Norman spotted something while watching Poulter throw away a golden opportunity to win the Turkish Airlines Open last week. \u2018I really appreciate someone with the stature of Greg taking the time to try and help me, it is very good of him,\u2019 said Poulter. Ian Poulter says he has spoken to Australian golfing hero Greg Norman about his putting game . \u2018Whether he\u2019s right or not, I\u2019ll let you know on Sunday night. The problem I\u2019ve got is that I\u2019ve been working very hard on my putting recently, and it is a fine line of whether you mess and try something else. But I\u2019ve certainly taken on board what he said and I\u2019ll review the footage myself and work on the putting green and see whether he was right or wrong.\u2019 In some ways the conclusion to that tournament in Turkey summed up a disappointing year for Poulter. Six shots ahead at one stage, he had a 6ft putt on the home green to force a play-off with American Brooks Koepka but, wholly uncharacteristically, missed it. On the positive side, it was his second high finish in a row at the end of a season featuring precious few such highlights. He can also take encouragement from a late-season change of equipment manufacturer from Cobra to Titleist clubs that has clearly gone off without a hitch. Now, in his own words, he is \u2018desperate to salvage something from 2014\u2019 with a win in this big bucks season finale. \u2018I\u2019ve had some good finishes here and it is a course that I really like,\u2019 said Poulter, who lost a play-off to Robert Karlsson here in 2010 and was pipped by another Swede, Henrik Stenson, last year. Norman gave Poulter advice on Tuesday night ahead of the season-ending\u00a0DP World Tour Championship . Poulter has Stenson in his sights once more this year, albeit the stakes are much lower this time. Twelve months ago, the Race to Dubai was at stake and the close friends had a good-natured bet which involved the loser serving drinks to the winner. This time the Race to Dubai has already been wrapped by Rory McIlroy, leaving Poulter to try to pip Stenson for second place, and a tidy bonus of \u00a3512,000. \u2018There\u2019s still a lot of money at stake, so it would certainly be nice to catch him\u2019 said Poulter. \u2018But there\u2019s no bet this year. We\u2019re not going for the whole shooting match, are we? That said, given the year I\u2019ve had, it would be nice to move up that board and finish second. Two weeks ago I was 64th, so there\u2019s clearly the chance to salvage something from 2014.\u2019 Poulter finished runner-up at the\u00a0Turkish Airlines Open last week despite leading by six shots at one point .\n\nSummary: Ian Poulter won the Turkish Airlines Open last week after receiving putting advice from Greg Norman. He's now preparing for the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai with confidence.",

It's wild,\" she said. \"Everybody's rushing and panicking. I could have stayed, but I thought it was best to just get out of there.\" Morgan said it took her about five hours to make the 200 mile drive to San Antonio -- a trip that normally only takes about three hours. Ike is expected to make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Texas, which is home to many of the country's oil refineries. That's led to a scramble at gas stations as people try to fill up before the storm hits. iReport.com: Are you in Ike's path? People were filling up their cars and their gas cans at a Sam's Club in College Station, Texas, iReporter Kyle Norton told CNN.com. \"The lines were a tad ridiculous,\" the 30-year-old banker said. Norton said his 2002 Dodge Ram pickup was on empty, so he had no choice but to wait in line for an hour. Despite the long lines, Norton said gas was about $3.49, which is pretty normal for the area. He said a friend had to go to four different stations before he could find one that still had regular unleaded. iReporter Jeremy \"Clete\" Terrell said the lines also were long at the Costco in Alpharetta, Georgia. \"I was getting gas and realized that everybody else was too,\" he said. iReporter Curtis McNeely said a Kangaroo Express station in Evansville, Indiana, imposed a 10 gallon limit. \"It's causing paranoia more than anything,\"  he said adding that people are returning to the gas station to fill up multiple times. A spokeswoman for the company that runs the Kangaroo Express chain says it's imposed a limit at its 1,660 stores because gas supplies are tight. Several stations in Ocala, Florida, were limiting sales if they still had gas to sell, iReporter Christine Bailey said. Canadian Ian McIntosh said gas prices jumped 57 cents per gallon overnight in Milton, Ontario. \"This stuff's in the tanks, it's just sitting in the gas stations, they're using this as a windfall event,\" the retired teacher said. McIntosh said he heard prices were going up on the news, so he and his wife got gas last night -- along with many other residents of the Toronto suburb. \"A gas station that would normally have three or four cars -- you had 15 cars and you had to line up to get to the pumps,\" he said. Rumors that gas would jump to $6 a gallon caused a panic in Sylva, North Carolina. iReport.com: Police called in at mountain gas station . Lines were a half-mile long Thursday night at the stations that stayed open, and police were called in to maintain order, iReporter April Brendle said. \"Supposedly there was a fight at one station,\" she said.\n\nSummary: Long gas lines reported as Hurricane Ike approaches. Gas prices jumped overnight in Canada. Police had to restore order at North Carolina gas stations. Are you in Ike's path? Send photos, videos.",
