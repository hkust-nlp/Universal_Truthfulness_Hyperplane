What do you want to know?\n\nPete: Well, don't laugh, but I met this really nice woman through an online music mailing list, you know, a discussion group on the Internet [laughter]. I need some advice. You see, Claudia, ...\n\nMarkus: Okay. So it's Claudia, oh?\n\nPete: Yeah, yeah. See, she invited me to spend two weeks in Germany [Hum]. And well, I told here I had studied a little bit about the country and language [Hum], and she's kind of expecting that I know more than I really do.\n\nMarkus: Hum. You're really in hot water now!\n\nPete: Yeah. I think so.\n\nMarkus: Well, what do you want to know?\n\nPete: Well, she's planning on introducing me to her parents.\n\nMarkus: Hey. Sounds kind of serious.\n\nPete: It isn't, at least I think it isn't. Anyway, what should you do when you greet someone for the first time in Germany?\n\nMarkus: Well, it depends upon your relationship with the person. Now, speaking of your girlfriend, Claudia, ....\n\nPete: Hey, I didn't say she was my girlfriend.\n\nMarkus: Ah, okay, okay. Now if you're meeting someone formally for the first time, like Claudia's parents, you should make sure you arrive on time.\n\nPete: Okay, so arrive on time. Uh, what about common greetings?\n\nMarkus: Well, Germans often shake hands, and they use the person's family name, unless they're really close friends.\n\nPete: Okay, what about with Claudia? I'm not sure what I should do in her case.\n\nMarkus: Ah. You can call her Claudia [Okay], shake hands, and why don't you take her some flowers?\n\nPete: Oh, how do you say \"Nice to meet you\" anyway?\n\nMarkus: Oh, \"Ich freue mich, Sie kennenzulernen.\"\n\nPete: \"Ich freu me senselen...? \"\n\nMarkus: Uhhh.

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nM: The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that?\n\nF: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said \"Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?\" So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n\nM: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?\n\nW: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.\n\nQuestion: What does the woman think of premarital contracting? \n\n- It helps a couple know more about each other\n\n- It makes a couple's relationship more stable\n\n- It helps to develop genuine love in a couple\nAnswer: It makes a couple's relationship more stable.",

It is difficult for two people of entirely different religions to live and share life together. They will face so many problems that it would be better if they don't get married in the first place.\n\nM: Of course there will be problems. Even two people of the same religion have problems. It is the same in this case. except that it will be slightly more difficult, I guess.\n\nW: I agree with you, Henry. Naturally, there will be arguments and personal differences. Marriage thrives on a give-and-take policy, so a couple will have to learn to adapt to each other's customs and traditions.\n\nM: That's right. Married people should be more tolerant towards each other and be willing to learn about each other's religion. Only then can understanding and acceptance be achieved ultimately.\n\nW: You talk as if it were very simple. It isn't, you know. I should know. as I am a child of a mixed marriage.\n\nM: All right, you tell us why is is not such a good idea.\n\nW: You see, Henry, it depends on the individuals concerned. If two people of different religions marry, they should be prepared for the consequences. It is only after marriage that the vast differences in the cultures begin to show. Little things, from food and clothes to bigger aspects like religious beliefs, tend to clash, leading eventually to a rift. Besides. there will be either personal pride or the reluctance to accept the other's views. It may lead to a big gap between the parents, and their children may suffer a lot in between.\n\nM: You have a point there. but I can also tell you of several such couples who are living happily together.\n\nW: I suppose that you are right. Intermarriage can lead to happiness or sorrow, depending on how it is handled.\n\nQuestion: The cultural differences arise ______ according to the woman. \n\n- at the wedding\n\n- before intermarriage\n\n- after people get married\nAnswer: after people get married.",

Americans are much more assertive than most foreigners. For example, Americans begin a discussion with a focus on accomplishments and concrete facts.\n\nJack: You're right. America is a rather individualistic society, with less social pressure to conform. So you will need to become more assertive and to speak out on your own behalf.\n\nPeter: Another aspect of American behavior is Americans are more guarded about personal space. So when you are talking to an American, don't stay too close. This personal distance is not due to body odor or bad breath, but because closeness lends a sense of intimacy that is out of proportion to the relationship at the moment.\n\nJack: Yes. Also, try to avoid physical contact while you are speaking. Touching is a bit too intimate for casual acquaintances. So don't put your arm around their shoulder, touch their face, or hold their hand. Shaking hands when you initially meet or part is acceptable, but this is only momentary.\n\nPeter: In many cultures, eye contact is a sign of disrespect, which is not the ease in America.

Of course, the conditions of work are very different: The Polytechnic is offering two-year contract which could be renewed, but the Language School is only offering a year's contract, and that's a definite minus. It could be renewed, but you never know.\n\nW: I see. So it's much less secure. But you don't need to think too much about steady jobs when you are only 23.\n\nM: That's true.\n\nW: What about the salaries?\n\nM: Well, the Pistoia job pays much better in the short term. I'll be getting the equivalent of about 22,000 pounds a year there, but only 20,000 pounds at the Polytechnic. But then the hours are different. At the Polytechnic I'd have to do 35 hours a week, 20 teaching and 15 administration, whereas the Pistoia school is only asking for 30 hours teaching.\n\nW: Mmm...\n\nM: Then the type of teaching is so different. The Polytechnic is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the Cambridge certificates. The Language School wants me to do a bit of exam preparation, but also quite a lot of work in companies and factories, and a couple of children's classes. Oh, and a bit of literature teaching.\n\nW: Well, that sounds much more varied and interesting. And I'd imagine you'd be doing quite a lot of teaching outside the school, and moving around quite a bit.\n\nM: Yes, whereas with the Polytechnic position, I'd be stuck in the school all day.\n\nQuestion: What do we learn about the students at the Polytechnic? \n\n- They hate exams.\n\n- The all plan to study in Cambridge.\n\n- They are all adults.\nAnswer: They hate exams.",

Yet no such thing exists. In fact I wasted a lot of time looking for the typical village. Conditions vary too widely.

Is the experience in this country so important to you that you came all the way from the United States?\n\nM: Well, that's also the question that the villagers ask me. They think that I'm crazy to give up my comfortable life in the United States and isolate myself from the outside world in this remote village, like a retired old man Why have I come? I've put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas have changed. I've come to believe that what is happening in the Third World is more important than anything else. But to understand how three-quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect the rest of the world, I feel that I first have to try and share their way of life.\n\nW: I must say I find your view on this issue very convincing.

Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm?\n\nM: I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs.

Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity.

I saw the most spectacular view when I was crossing a bridge to Manhattan at dusk, and the skyscrapers were lit up producing a classic nighttime view of Manhattan.\n\nFrank: That's really beautiful.\n\nTerry: But that's not the whole picture. Some of the streets in New York are very rough. I saw large piles of garbage cans at the roadside, and graffiti all over garage doors and store shutters.\n\nFrank: I can't believe it.\n\nTerry: The garbage are tidily bagged and boxed, though.\n\nFrank: Did you stay in a hotel?\n\nTerry: Yes. The hotel we stayed at turned out to be fairly decent, though the room was small, with a tiny bathroom that was only about 3 feet larger than the bed. As I was inexperienced with tourist-area hotels, I was startled, I mean, the room was $129 a night. But at least the room was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable.\n\nFrank: What's your general impression of New York?\n\nTerry: Well, restaurants pack their tiny tables very tightly; grocery stores and bookstores have aisles that are narrow; the sidewalks are cluttered with newsstands, vendors and their carts, and places that aren't restrictively small, such as the lawns around the Natural History Museum, are full of people, so they're no escape.\n\nQuestion: What does Terry say about the garbage in New York? \n\n- Smelly.\n\n- Scattered.\n\n- Put in bags and boxes.\nAnswer: Smelly.",

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nM: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n\nW: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n\nM: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n\nW: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n\nM: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n\nW: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n\nM: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n\nW: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.\n\nQuestion: Why does the woman compare human memory to a hard disc drive? \n\n- Because both can be wiped out by accidents.\n\n- Because both can be trained to work better.\n\n- Because both can be expanded.\nAnswer: Because both can be trained to work better.",

I mean, if you have always lived in a city, as I had, then something must happen to make you want to move. In my case I was made redundant, and, when it came to looking around for a new job, I just couldn't face going back into an office again. So I sat down and thought about what I'd really like to do.\n\nInterviewer: And that, I suppose, turned out to be something in the country?\n\nRoger: No, initially I didn't think of moving, but just of getting a different kind of job, you know social work with kids or old people, that kind of tiring.\n\nInterviewer: So what happened, why didn't you?\n\nRoger: Well, I hadn't got any of the right qualifications, and it would have taken me two years to get qualified and I certainly didn't want to go back to formal education again.\n\nInterviewer: Couldn't you have learned while on the job sort of picked it up as you went along?\n\nRoger: No, you have to have a diploma. Anyway, after talking it over with friends who had moved out I thought I'd like to give it a try--after all, a change of scene...\n\nInterviewer: Is better than.., yes, we all know that. So, where did you go when you did decide to move?\n\nRoger: I went right out to Shropshire. After all I thought if you're going to go rural you might as well do it properly. The first problem though was how I was going to make a living. There are fewer jobs in the country, so I decided to start up on my own.\n\nInterviewer: That's pretty ambitious, a townie moving off to the depths of the country and setting up his own business. How did you start, had you got any skills?\n\nRoger: I'd always had a garden and grown some vegetables and flowers, you know, usual things, salad stuff, carrots, peas, beans, a bit of fruit, some roses.., so I thought of a small holding, a kind of small farm. But when I looked at the prices to buy, I changed my mind; I didn't...\n\nQuestion: Why did the man give up the idea of being a social worker? \n\n- Because he didn't have a diploma.\n\n- Because he wanted to change to another job.\n\n- Because he went to the countryside.\nAnswer: Because he didn't have a diploma.",

Well, I've got the details about different jobs and I'd like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for.\n\nF: Where are the jobs?\n\nM: One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg.\n\nF: Munich's supposed to be a very nice place.\n\nM: Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias.\n\nF: That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends!\n\nM: But, one problem with Munich is that it's growing very fast. That means the cost of living will probably be very high.\n\nF: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me.\n\nF: Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays.\n\nM: That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares.\n\nF: What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain?\n\nM: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now.\n\nF: And what about accommodation?\n\nM: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think.\n\nF: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities?\n\nM: In fact, they're quite good in all three. But, of course, Munich has an international reputation as a cultural center.\n\nF: Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities. How long would you want to go to Germany for?\n\nM: I think a maximum of five years. I think working overseas will be good for my career and, of course, it'd be a good experience for you and the kids, too!\n\nF: So we'd be there...\n\nQuestion: How long does the man intend to stay in Germany? \n\n- One year.\n\n- Around two years.\n\n- No more than five years.\nAnswer: One year.",

The smells of the sea reminds me of happy family holidays, and the smell of roses makes me think of my friend's house. Strangely enough, I like the smell of air craft fuel at airports. Then I know I am going to fly somewhere exciting. But it's the general smell of my garden in the rain that I really like the most. That means I am at home where I should be.\n\nQuestion: What is the woman's view on smell? \n\n- It is personal.\n\n- It is concrete.\n\n- It is strange.\nAnswer: It is personal.",

What kind of unusual ability are we talking about here?\n\nW: Wow, it's quite easy to describe. Basically, when I read a word or even think of a particular word, such as Tuesday, I see a color connected with it. It's not that I imagine a color. I really see it loading in front of my eyes.\n\nM: How interesting! Is it a sort of medical condition?\n\nW: Yes. And just recently doctors have begun to understand it more. They call it synesthesia, which means that somewhere in my brain, there are links between sections that should really be separate. Other people have a form of this condition that affects emotions. So they see colors when they feel particular emotions. Apparently, it's generally passed on from parents to their children, which is the case with me.\n\nM: Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability?\n\nW: Yes, my brother is the same as me. If we start talking about it, people think we are completely mad. When we were younger, we used to have arguments about things like what color the word Tuesday is. It turns out that everyone with this condition sees different colors.\n\nM: It sounds as though it could make life quite exhausting.\n\nW: I suppose it does. But you see, if you've never known anything different, you don't think of it like that. It does make you aware of your moods. I know when I started to feel depressed, things begin to look grey.\n\nM: Are there any other advantages do you find?\n\nW: Well, it seems that quite a lot of artists and musicians have this condition. So I guess it can be beneficial if it's combined with some sort of gift or natural talent, which is not the case with me unfortunately. But I do find that it makes reading very interesting, because sometimes a sentence has a very nice range of colors. So you want to read it again just to experience that. Of course, this makes me quite a slow reader.\n\nQuestion: When the woman was younger, what did she and her brother often argue about? \n\n- Whether they had unusual abilities.\n\n- The colors connected with words.\n\n- Why they saw different colors for certain words.\nAnswer: The colors connected with words.",

Does it look that bad?\n\nDentist: Well, we're going to remove the decay, and then we'll either put a filling in, or if the decay is extensive, we can't repair it, we might have to put a crown on your tooth.

The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.\n\nM: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.\n\nW: About what time would you think that they were there?\n\nM: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.\n\nW: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.\n\nM: In fact, yes, as short as that.\n\nW: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?\n\nM: Fifty meters.\n\nW: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?\n\nM: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.\n\nW: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.\n\nM: No, not at this stage.\n\nW: Well, thank you very much.\n\nQuestion: Who is the murderer? \n\n- A minicab driver.\n\n- Not known yet.\n\n- Two women.\nAnswer: Not known yet.",

Ms Rawson...\n\nW: Thank you. Both Ann and I are full-time counsellors. Students either come tons on their own or are referred to us by a tutor. We see students individually, run group therapy sessions and courses of sessions as we think necessary. We are here to help with any problems? no matter how great or small, such as homesickness, relationship difficulties, death and separation, sexual problems, undue stress due to work and so on. You will not be the first to be homesick, find college life stressful, or decisions problematic. So please don't hesitate to come and have a chat if there is anything bothering you. This is a confidential service but we are willing to arrange with your course directors, your tutors, Student Union officers, career department or doctors. We can also put you in touch with outside counselling services. As a part of the university, all counselling is free of charge for full-time students. I know some of you may feel that seeing a counsellor has a stigma attached to it, but let me assure you even the best balanced individuals encounter situations where they need someone to talk with.

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nW: One of the most interesting experiments with dolphins must be one done by Doctor Jarvis Bastian. What he tried to do was to teach a male dolphin called Bass and a female called Doris to communicate with each other across a solid barrier.\n\nM: So how did he do it exactly?\n\nW: Well, first of all, he kept the two dolphins together in the same tank and taught them to press levers whenever they saw a light. The levers were fitted to the side of the tank next to each other. If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish.\n\nM: Sounds terribly complicated.\n\nW: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn't actually see each other. The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that Doris had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light.\n\nM: So did it work?\n\nW: Well, amazingly enough, the dolphins achieved a 100 % success rate.\n\nQuestion: How did the second stage of the experiment differ from the first stage? \n\n- Only one dolphin was able to see the light.\n\n- The male dolphin received more rewards.\n\n- Both dolphins were put in the same tank.\nAnswer: Only one dolphin was able to see the light.",

It's great fun reading those wonderful children stories by Doctor Seuss.\n\nM: Doctor Seuss? I don't remember seeing his name on the reading list.\n\nW: His full name's Theodore Seuss Geisel. You can find this name on the reading list. Doctor Seuss is his pen name.\n\nM: I love reading those stories as a child. It'll be interesting to read them now from a different point of view. I guess they'll give me a good idea of how children think.\n\nW: Those stories are also great for classroom use.\n\nM: How's that?\n\nW: Well, take a typical Doctor Seuss's book like The Cat in the Hat. It has a controlled vocabulary of only two hundred words.\n\nM: So that means the children get lots of practices using a small number of words over and over again.\n\nW: Exactly. In fact The Cat in the Hat was written mainly to show how a controlled-vocabulary book could also be interesting and fun.\n\nM: Well, it sounds as though this course is also going to be interesting and fun. I think I'll get started on those readings tonight.\n\nQuestion: What is true about The Cat in the Hat? \n\n- It is a book written only for classroom reading.\n\n- It is a book on education.\n\n- It has a vocabulary of only two hundred words.\nAnswer: It is a book written only for classroom reading.",

A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack.\n\nW: Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example?\n\nM: Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies.\n\nW: You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh?\n\nM: Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program.\n\nW: Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public?\n\nM: Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say \"Aaah\" while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed.\n\nW: What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh?\n\nM: Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference!\n\nQuestion: What can we learn about smile or laugh according to Dr. Berk? \n\n- Even a fake one can benefit people physiologically just as well as a real one.\n\n- You can't fool your body by pretending to be happy.\n\n- A smart mind can't tell the difference between a fake one and a real one.\nAnswer: You can't fool your body by pretending to be happy.",

Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n\nW: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n\nM: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n\nW: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n\nM: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n\nW: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n\nM: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n\nW: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.\n\nQuestion: How can we remember things more easily according to the woman? \n\n- By connecting them with a physical object.\n\n- By looking at them very carefully first.\n\n- By having people remind us of them.\nAnswer: By connecting them with a physical object.",

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nM: The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that?\n\nF: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said \"Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?\" So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n\nM: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?\n\nW: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.\n\nQuestion: How do people see premarital contracting in general? \n\n- It is unfeasible and unnecessary\n\n- It suggests distrust between the two partners\n\n- It is only effective for someone rich and famous\nAnswer: It is unfeasible and unnecessary.",

If you are suffering from anxiety or depression, poetry may be the solution to your problems. Dr Stewart, how does poetry help?\n\nM: Em, OK! Look, let me give you an example. A patient came into our clinic last month. He was a middle-aged businessmen, and he was feeling, well, like most middle-aged businessmen, really stressed and with his life out of control. He talked to me about it, and, well, I was convinced that medication just wouldn't help him. Then I read him a poem called Leisure by WHDavis. Do you know the one? It begins, er...\n\nW: I do, yes.\n\nM: What is this life, er, so full of. It is so or if...\n\nW: I think it's if.\n\nM: If full of care, that's it, yes. We have no time to stand and stare. Well, you know the one. The next time he came to see me, he told me that, well, it was a sort of turning point for him. The poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life. Er, you see, because the idea was expressed poetically, he felt that he could identify with it, and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn't if he simply discussed it with me. And we just had the usual kind of conversation about it.\n\nW: Yes, I see.\n\nM: You see, reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer. Encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect, actually. Era, there.., there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety. This happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose, you see. Er, now, for a long time, we've been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words. But it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients.\n\nW: Right, and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same...\n\nQuestion: How did this poem help the person? \n\n- He stopped worrying.\n\n- He found a new balance in his life.\n\n- He felt more relaxed.\nAnswer: He stopped worrying.",

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nM: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n\nW: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n\nM: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n\nW: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n\nM: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n\nW: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n\nM: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n\nW: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.\n\nQuestion: What are we told about people suffering from Alzheimer's disease? \n\n- They don't understand the mechanisms of memory.\n\n- They can't remember who they are.\n\n- They forget how to perform simple tasks.\nAnswer: They forget how to perform simple tasks.",

How can I help you?\n\nM: I'm fixing up on next project team meeting, and I just want to check some possible dates with you.\n\nW: Fine, let me just get my diary. Ok, which dates are you looking at?\n\nM: I've spoken to the others, and they prefer either the third week of May or the second week of June.\n\nW: Yeah, both of the weeks are pretty clear at the moment except for the 11th of June.\n\nM: Right, I've got that.\n\nW: So where is the meeting taking place this time?\n\nM: It was going to be in London. But I spoke to Carlos in Mexico City and he suggested Chicago. He thinks it will be more convenient for most of the team.\n\nW: He's probably right. It'll certainly be much easier for me as well. Because I can fly from Toronto, and I'm sure you can find a meeting room somewhere near the airport.\n\nM: That's a good idea. I'll check up some hotels in that area and get back to you towards the end of the week.\n\nW: Fine, but I'm not in the office on Friday.\n\nM: Ok, I'll call you later in the afternoon on Thursday.\n\nW: No problem. Bye.\n\nQuestion: Their meeting will probably take place in ________. \n\n- London.\n\n- Toronto.\n\n- Chicago.\nAnswer: Chicago.",
