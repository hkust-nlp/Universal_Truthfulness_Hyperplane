One of my good childhood memories was dinner with my parents and two sisters. Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies, we seldom had a chance to get together as a family. But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot. We made plans for trips. We discussed each other's problems. After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful. And now we all feel than we have been able to build stronger relationships within the family that we had before.\n\nQuestion: Who finally set the time for these family dinners? \n\n- The children.\n\n- The father.\n\n- The woman speaker.\nAnswer: The children.",

I may go to the beach and stay in a small hotel where I can watch the sea. I just want to take it easy, you know.\n\nM: I understand. You've worked too hard this semester.

I waited an hour to sign up for a distance-learning course.\n\nM: Distance learning? Never heard of it.\n\nW: Well, it's new this semester. It's only open to psychology majors. But I bet it'll catch on elsewhere. Yesterday, over a hundred students signed up.\n\nM: Well, what is it?\n\nW: It's an experimental course. I registered for child psychology. All I have got to do is watch a twelve-week series of televised lessons. The department shows them several different times a day and in several different locations.\n\nM: Don't you ever have to meet with professor?\n\nW: Yeah. After each part of the series I have to talk to her and the other students on the phone, you know, about our ideas. Then we'll meet on campus three times for reviews and exams.\n\nM: It sounds pretty non-traditional to me. But I guess it makes sense, considering how many students have jobs. It must really help with their schedules, not to mention how it will cut down on traffic.\n\nW: You know,last year my department did a survey and they found out that 80 percent of all psychology majors were employed. That's why they came up with the program.\n\nM: The only thing is: doesn't it seem impersonal though? I mean, I miss having class discussions and hearing what other people thinks.\n\nW: Well, I guess that's why phone contact's important. Any way, it's an experiment. Maybe I'll end up hating it.\n\nM: Maybe. But I'll be curious to see how it works up.\n\nQuestion: Where did the man see the woman yesterday? \n\n- On television.\n\n- At registration center.\n\n- In class.\nAnswer: On television.",

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nW: Dr Thomas? This is Keet Bradley from Daily News. I'd like to ask you some questions about the new official standard weight that you purchased.\n\nM: I'd be happy to help you. What would you like to know?\n\nW: First of all, how was the standard weight used?\n\nM: Well, the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country. The department of weights and measures, we are a government agency. It's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales.\n\nW: How did you check the scales before?\n\nM: We have an old standard weight that we used to use. It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture.\n\nW: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less.\n\nM: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n\nW: How much did it cost?\n\nM: About 45 thousand dollars.\n\nW: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n\nM: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard. Think of the drug industry, for example, those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine.\n\nQuestion: What does Dr Thomas probably think about the cost of the new weight? \n\n- It is a small amount to pay for so much precious metal.\n\n- It is difficult to judge the value of such an object.\n\n- It is reasonable for an object with such an important function.\nAnswer: It is reasonable for an object with such an important function.",

We must have advertising, mustn't we?\n\nW: Why?\n\nM: Well, we wouldn't know what there was to buy if we didn't have advertisements.\n\nW: Yes, that's true.

I don't think that intelligent businessmen will spend millions of dollars on advertising if nobody believes the advertisements, do you?\n\nM: Perhaps not, but after all, it's their money that they are spending.\n\nW: Is it? I think not. The cost of advertising is added to the price of the article.

I think ...\n\nParent: No, it's ... it's more than that. Some of the kids in your class have really been bullying her a lot.\n\nTeacher: What do you mean?\n\nParent: Well, um, they've been teasing her a lot about her appearance, and then, the other day, you didn't help things [ What? ] Yeah, she said you made a comment about her clothes.\n\nTeacher: What do you mean? I mean ...\n\nParent: She said you commented on her shirt and jeans, like they were from the 1970s or something like that.\n\nTeacher: Well I was just kind of joking a little bit with her.\n\nParent: Well, yeah, that's what you think, but other kids follow your example. In fact, one of the kids took a picture of her with their phone and posted it and had some real nasty comments on Facebook. It was terrible.\n\nTeacher: Well, you know, kids can be kids.\n\nParent: No, don't you get it? This is bullying; it's cyberbullying, and adults like you are part of the problem. Forget it.

You did! ], but ...\n\nParent: I get sick and tired of people thinking that a little teasing is okay. Too many kids are killing themselves because they feel that there's just no way to escape this.\n\nTeacher: Okay. Well, I guess I need to be a little bit more careful, but ...\n\nParent: Yeah, you do. I really hope I can get Megan to come to school tomorrow.

But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.\n\nW: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?\n\nM: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.\n\nW: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?\n\nM: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.\n\nQuestion: What does the man think we should do now? \n\n- Minimize the use of fossil fuels.\n\n- Start developing alternative fuels.\n\n- Find the real cause for global warming.\nAnswer: Start developing alternative fuels.",

As a human resource manager, how do you see it?\n\nW: It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace. In my opinion, communication means interaction and is vital in business. It ensures smooth operation between staff members, employers and clients.\n\nM: Can you explain that more precisely?\n\nW: Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees, while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers.\n\nM: Do you say communication means talking to others?\n\nW: Well, communication doesn't always refer to conversations.\n\nM: Like what?\n\nW: For instance, written communication. It is very important in business. Mostly, being in the business area, communicating for the first time with someone, for example a client, is made through e-mails. Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional.\n\nM: Besides the work communication with business clients, how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues?\n\nW: Regardless of how good you are at your job, if you don't form at least basic relationships with those around you, it will ultimately affect your career success.\n\nM: What you've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization.\n\nW: Not really, the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior. Actually, some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members. You know, bad communication leads to misunderstandings. Meanwhile, the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients. To ensure that business continues to grow, a company's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees. This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication.\n\nQuestion: How does the woman think of a good written communication? \n\n- It's the most important part of communication.\n\n- It's helpful to make a good impression on clients.\n\n- It's vital to have good communication between colleagues.\nAnswer: It's helpful to make a good impression on clients.",

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nW: What does the term \"alternative energy source\" mean?\n\nM: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.\n\nW: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?\n\nM: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.\n\nW: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?\n\nM: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.\n\nQuestion: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? \n\n- Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes.\n\n- Anything that can be used to produce power.\n\n- Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.\nAnswer: Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.",

But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot.

Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest.

Good evening!\n\nW: What would you like to talk about the great writer? Maybe some details that we don't quite know.\n\nM: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true.\n\nW: Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening.\n\nM: Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money. He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers, and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi.\n\nW: Did Twain like that job?\n\nM: He loved this job, and many of his books show it. The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck.\n\nW: That's interesting!\n\nM: But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings. Like many other popular writers, Twain derived much of the materials for his writing from the wealth and diversity of his own experience.\n\nQuestion: What connection does the lecture suggest between Twain's travels and his writings? \n\n- His stories were inspired by his travels.\n\n- His travels prevented him from writing.\n\n- He traveled in order to relax from the pressures of writing:\nAnswer: His travels prevented him from writing.",

Maybe some details that we don't quite know.\n\nM: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true.\n\nW: Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening.\n\nM: Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money. He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers, and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi.\n\nW: Did Twain like that job?\n\nM: He loved this job, and many of his books show it. The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck.\n\nW: That's interesting!\n\nM: But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings. Like many other popular writers, Twain derived much of the materials for his writing from the wealth and diversity of his own experience.\n\nQuestion: Which aspect of Mark Twain's life does the speaker focus on? \n\n- His travels.\n\n- His short stories.\n\n- His finances.\nAnswer: His travels.",

Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized.\n\nW: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized?\n\nM: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that.\n\nW: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared?\n\nM: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America. Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year. But you see, those governments are preparing to pour money into the transport system to keep it going.\n\nW: So in a sense, you cope between two extremes.

Here it was a lot of fat middle-aged Europeans and Americans exercising along the beach, sunbathing, walking with their walkmans. It's a big contrast to the thousands of people sleeping on the street during night.\n\nJason: What was the weather like?\n\nBerry: The climate is very different from other places such as Peru or Bolivia. We were at sea level, and we all felt very good about it. No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time, and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid.\n\nJason: That's really nice.\n\nBerry: The first day we had very nice weather, and were able to really relax on the beach. After these two days we had bad weather, rain and cloudy. So, we're a little bit disappointed about that. Due to the weather, we explored the old part of Rio.\n\nJason: How about the food there?\n\nBerry: We ate at local restaurant. Tiffs restaurant has a fixed fee of about US $10. Then you can eat as much as you want from a vast and delicate buffet consisting of both seafood and meat. Dessert and drinks are not included.\n\nJason: It's been really a nice trip.\n\nBerry: Well, Rio was not the experience we had hoped for, and we feel that this city is over-publicized.

If you don't like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't go and use another.\n\nM: Some people who write to me say this. They say that if you didn't have a monopoly, you wouldn't be able to do the things you do. Well, I don't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized.\n\nW: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized?\n\nM: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that.\n\nW: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared?\n\nM: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America. Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year. But you see, those governments are preparing to pour money into the transport system to keep it going.\n\nW: So in a sense, you cope between two extremes.

Sounds a little strange.\n\nW: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n\nM: That's a pretty long span of time.\n\nW: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: \"Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.\"\n\nM: Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell?\n\nW: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size.\n\nM: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens?\n\nW: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine?\n\nM: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n\nW: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans. Maybe some of those monster stories are true.\n\nQuestion: According to the woman, what happened 200 to 500 million years ago? \n\n- Some sea creatures developed vertebrae.\n\n- The first giant squid was captured.\n\n- Some sea creatures shed their shells.\nAnswer: Some sea creatures shed their shells.",

What would you like to know?\n\nW: First of all, how was the standard weight used?\n\nM: Well, the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country. The department of weights and measures, we are a government agency. It's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales.\n\nW: How did you check the scales before?\n\nM: We have an old standard weight that we used to use. It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture.\n\nW: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less.\n\nM: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n\nW: How much did it cost?\n\nM: About 45 thousand dollars.\n\nW: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n\nM: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard.

One of my good childhood memories was dinner with my parents and two sisters. Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies, we seldom had a chance to get together as a family. But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot. We made plans for trips. We discussed each other's problems. After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful. And now we all feel than we have been able to build stronger relationships within the family that we had before.\n\nQuestion: How many people are there in the woman's family? \n\n- Three.\n\n- Four.\n\n- Five.\nAnswer: Three.",

One of my good childhood memories was dinner with my parents and two sisters. Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies, we seldom had a chance to get together as a family. But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot. We made plans for trips. We discussed each other's problems. After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful. And now we all feel than we have been able to build stronger relationships within the family that we had before.\n\nQuestion: What did the children think about having dinner together at home? \n\n- They thought it was funny.\n\n- They disliked the idea at first.\n\n- They preferred eating with friends.\nAnswer: They disliked the idea at first.",

I'd like to ask you some questions about the new official standard weight that you purchased.\n\nM: I'd be happy to help you. What would you like to know?\n\nW: First of all, how was the standard weight used?\n\nM: Well, the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country. The department of weights and measures, we are a government agency. It's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales.\n\nW: How did you check the scales before?\n\nM: We have an old standard weight that we used to use. It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture.\n\nW: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less.\n\nM: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n\nW: How much did it cost?\n\nM: About 45 thousand dollars.\n\nW: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n\nM: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard. Think of the drug industry, for example, those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine.\n\nQuestion: How was the weight used? \n\n- To check the accuracy of scales.\n\n- To calculate the density of other metals.\n\n- To observe changes in the atmosphere.\nAnswer: To check the accuracy of scales.",

Hey, why don't you whip up some of your oatmeal cookies? [Well ...] Hey, you could even ask, uh ..., what's her name ... yeah that new girl, Susan, the one that moved in across the street!

And the other buildings that did not burn are being de-smoked. As to the cause of the fire, all we know is that we were having trouble with the pilot lights since we bought the stove in July and it had been serviced three times. Well, as a matter of fact, we think it was a malfunctioning stove that may have caused the fire. Nothing definite yet has been determined.\n\nW: Have you heard from other schools or other institutional users of this stove that have had the same problem?\n\nM: No. I wouldn't know anything more about the stove itself. All I know is that this fire went up so quickly that there's been a suspicion about why it went up so quickly. And it may be that there was a gas blast.

We're just extremely thrilled that no one was hurt and that's because of the fire fighters that were here, nine of them. They're wonderful.\n\nW: And I'm sure you send your thanks out to them, uh?\n\nM: Well, we're sending out thanks to them in a letter or in any other way we can.

Sounds a little strange.\n\nW: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n\nM: That's a pretty long span of time.\n\nW: I know. That's what she said, though.

Can you imagine?\n\nM: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n\nW: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans.

Good evening!\n\nW: What would you like to talk about the great writer? Maybe some details that we don't quite know.\n\nM: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true.\n\nW: Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening.\n\nM: Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money. He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers, and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi.\n\nW: Did Twain like that job?\n\nM: He loved this job, and many of his books show it. The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck.\n\nW: That's interesting!\n\nM: But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings. Like many other popular writers, Twain derived much of the materials for his writing from the wealth and diversity of his own experience.\n\nQuestion: What job did Twain especially love? \n\n- Typesetter.\n\n- River pilot.\n\n- Soldier.\nAnswer: Typesetter.",

Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot.

It ensures smooth operation between staff members, employers and clients.\n\nM: Can you explain that more precisely?\n\nW: Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees, while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers.\n\nM: Do you say communication means talking to others?\n\nW: Well, communication doesn't always refer to conversations.\n\nM: Like what?\n\nW: For instance, written communication. It is very important in business. Mostly, being in the business area, communicating for the first time with someone, for example a client, is made through e-mails. Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional.\n\nM: Besides the work communication with business clients, how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues?\n\nW: Regardless of how good you are at your job, if you don't form at least basic relationships with those around you, it will ultimately affect your career success.\n\nM: What you've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization.\n\nW: Not really, the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior. Actually, some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members. You know, bad communication leads to misunderstandings. Meanwhile, the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients. To ensure that business continues to grow, a company's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees. This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication.\n\nQuestion: What do we learn from the conversation? \n\n- Miscommunication shall affect the growth of a company.\n\n- Career success depends on how an employee develops his job skills.\n\n- Companies hold social events to increase their sales.\nAnswer: Career success depends on how an employee develops his job skills.",

Good evening!\n\nW: What would you like to talk about the great writer? Maybe some details that we don't quite know.\n\nM: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true.\n\nW: Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening.\n\nM: Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money. He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers, and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi.\n\nW: Did Twain like that job?\n\nM: He loved this job, and many of his books show it. The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck.\n\nW: That's interesting!\n\nM: But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings. Like many other popular writers, Twain derived much of the materials for his writing from the wealth and diversity of his own experience.\n\nQuestion: Why did Twain go west? \n\n- He wanted to be a journalist.\n\n- He liked the climate there.\n\n- He wanted to get away from the army.\nAnswer: He wanted to be a journalist.",

No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time, and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid.\n\nJason: That's really nice.\n\nBerry: The first day we had very nice weather, and were able to really relax on the beach.

I'd like to ask you some questions about the new official standard weight that you purchased.\n\nM: I'd be happy to help you. What would you like to know?\n\nW: First of all, how was the standard weight used?\n\nM: Well, the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country. The department of weights and measures, we are a government agency. It's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales.\n\nW: How did you check the scales before?\n\nM: We have an old standard weight that we used to use. It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture.\n\nW: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less.\n\nM: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n\nW: How much did it cost?\n\nM: About 45 thousand dollars.\n\nW: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n\nM: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard. Think of the drug industry, for example, those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine.\n\nQuestion: What is the conversation mainly about? \n\n- How to care for precious metals.\n\n- A standard unit for measuring weight.\n\n- The value of precious metals.\nAnswer: How to care for precious metals.",

Sounds a little strange.\n\nW: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n\nM: That's a pretty long span of time.\n\nW: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: \"Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.\"\n\nM: Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell?\n\nW: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size.\n\nM: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens?\n\nW: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine?\n\nM: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n\nW: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans.

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nW: What does the term \"alternative energy source\" mean?\n\nM: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.\n\nW: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?\n\nM: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.\n\nW: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?\n\nM: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.\n\nQuestion: What do most experts agree on according to the man? \n\n- Oil will soon be replaced by alternative energy sources.\n\n- Oil production will begin to decline worldwide by 2025.\n\n- Oil consumption has given rise to many global problems.\nAnswer: Oil will soon be replaced by alternative energy sources.",

My brother is coming for a visit this summer, and we'd like to see some of the country. But traveling is so expensive.\n\nW: Have you thought about camping? I think you'll really like it. You can rent the equipment you need. It's much cheaper than buying it or staying at a hotel.\n\nM: What a good idea! We can drive until we find a nice spot and just camp wherever we like.\n\nW: Well, not exactly. It's usually not allowed unless you camp in a pointed area. But there are many national parks and state parks owning camp grounds around the country.\n\nM: But that takes all the fun out of it.\n\nW: Not really.

Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate.

[Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n\nProgram Host: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n\ngreensGuest: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n\nProgram Host: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n\nGuest: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n\nProgram Host: Okay.

If you don't like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't go and use another.\n\nM: Some people who write to me say this. They say that if you didn't have a monopoly, you wouldn't be able to do the things you do. Well, I don't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized.\n\nW: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized?\n\nM: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that.\n\nW: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared?\n\nM: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America. Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year. But you see, those governments are preparing to pour money into the transport system to keep it going.\n\nW: So in a sense, you cope between two extremes. On the one hand, you're trying not to lose too much money. And on the other hand, you've got to provide the best service.\n\nM: Yes, you are right.\n\nQuestion: What does the man say threatens the existence of railways? \n\n- The low efficiency of their operation.\n\n- Competition from other modes of transport.\n\n- Constant complaints from passengers.\nAnswer: The low efficiency of their operation.",

Now, Mr. Smith, what is the purpose of your survey?\n\nM: We wanted to explore how people around the world view obesity or being overweight. Actually, obesity has gone global.\n\nW: How did you do it?\n\nM: We interviewed 16,000 people in 16 countries.\n\nW: How large is the overweight population of the world according to your estimates?\n\nM: 1.6 billion including 18 million children under age 5.\n\nW: Really surprising, isn't it? And what are your findings about people's attitudes regarding obesity?\n\nM: Our survey found that people in Brazil feel the most pressure to be thin. 83% of Brazilians think there is too much emphasis placed on weight. French are most likely to blame Americans. They use American's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem. Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity. They are followed by Germans and Indians. When asked who encouraged them to try to lose weight, the Swiss tend to exclude their doctor.\n\nW: Stay tuned for more about the NWHA survey, we will be back soon after the break.\n\nQuestion: In which country do people feel the most pressure to be thin? \n\n- Brazil.\n\n- India.\n\n- France.\nAnswer: India.",

We'll send out the manuals this afternoon by express mail entirely at our cost, and the manuals should arrive tomorrow or the day after at the latest.\n\nM: All of them, right?\n\nW: Yes. It maybe that some have them already, but we cannot be sure. So the best thing is to send out the manual for every pack.\n\nM: Yes. Yes, I see.

Thanks for your swift action.\n\nW: Not at all. Thank you and goodbye for now. Do call if there is anything else.\n\nM: All right. Thank you.

It ensures smooth operation between staff members, employers and clients.\n\nM: Can you explain that more precisely?\n\nW: Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees, while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers.\n\nM: Do you say communication means talking to others?\n\nW: Well, communication doesn't always refer to conversations.\n\nM: Like what?\n\nW: For instance, written communication. It is very important in business. Mostly, being in the business area, communicating for the first time with someone, for example a client, is made through e-mails. Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional.\n\nM: Besides the work communication with business clients, how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues?\n\nW: Regardless of how good you are at your job, if you don't form at least basic relationships with those around you, it will ultimately affect your career success.\n\nM: What you've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization.\n\nW: Not really, the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior. Actually, some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members. You know, bad communication leads to misunderstandings. Meanwhile, the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients. To ensure that business continues to grow, a company's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees. This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication.\n\nQuestion: What do we learn about communication? \n\n- Communication means person-to-person talking.\n\n- Communication means e-mails and letters between colleagues.\n\n- Communication means interactions between people.\nAnswer: Communication means person-to-person talking.",

As a human resource manager, how do you see it?\n\nW: It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace. In my opinion, communication means interaction and is vital in business. It ensures smooth operation between staff members, employers and clients.\n\nM: Can you explain that more precisely?\n\nW: Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees, while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers.\n\nM: Do you say communication means talking to others?\n\nW: Well, communication doesn't always refer to conversations.\n\nM: Like what?\n\nW: For instance, written communication. It is very important in business. Mostly, being in the business area, communicating for the first time with someone, for example a client, is made through e-mails. Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional.\n\nM: Besides the work communication with business clients, how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues?\n\nW: Regardless of how good you are at your job, if you don't form at least basic relationships with those around you, it will ultimately affect your career success.\n\nM: What you've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization.\n\nW: Not really, the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior. Actually, some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members. You know, bad communication leads to misunderstandings. Meanwhile, the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients. To ensure that business continues to grow, a company's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees. This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication.\n\nQuestion: How does the woman think of a good written communication? \n\n- It's the most important part of communication.\n\n- It's helpful to make a good impression on clients.\n\n- It's vital to have good communication between colleagues.\nAnswer: It's the most important part of communication.",

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nW: What does the term \"alternative energy source\" mean?\n\nM: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.\n\nW: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?\n\nM: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.\n\nW: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?\n\nM: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.\n\nQuestion: What does the man think we should do now? \n\n- Minimize the use of fossil fuels.\n\n- Start developing alternative fuels.\n\n- Find the real cause for global warming.\nAnswer: Minimize the use of fossil fuels.",

Plus, I wrote a lot of notes in the book that should help you with the class ... if you could read my writing.\n\nAshley: What else are you selling?\n\nCarl: Okay, I have English writing textbook for fourteen dollars, a math book for twenty-three, and a novel for only seven bucks.\n\nAshley: Uh, Hmmm.\n\nCarl: It's up to you. You know, these things go fast. I mean you have to listen to my advice as your older brother.\n\nAshley: Psh. I'll take the English book and the novel. I need both of those for sure. I think I'll hold off on buying other books for now. [Okay.] Teachers are always changing their minds about textbooks. [Alright.] And, what are those books?\n\nCarl: Which ones? Ah, ah, nothing. Never mind.\n\nAshley: Wait, wait, wait. Finding Your Perfect Someone. You're selling it for forty dollars? What's, what's this all about? And the price?\n\nCarl: Well. You .. It's a ... It's just a marital relations class. You know about finding a partner. You know, mom's always, you know, on me about that. What does it matter to you anyway?\n\nAshley: Forty dollars? That's a little expense.\n\nCarl: Well, they guarantee results, but ah, never mind. You would never understand.\n\nAshley: What about this one? Introduction to Gourmet Cooking? Why did you take this class? You hate cooking.\n\nCarl: Well, um, I have a friend who's into cooking, and she's [She?] ... I mean, my friend's taking the class. I mean, ugh, does it really matter?\n\nAshley: A marriage class ... a close female friend ... a cooking textbook ... I think I get the picture.

So, do you want to buy any of these textbooks or not?\n\nQuestion: Why does the man want to study cooking? \n\n- He wants to learn to cook because he lives on his own.\n\n- He wants to major in hotel management in the future.\n\n- He has a friend who's taking the same class.\nAnswer: He has a friend who's taking the same class.",

Good evening!\n\nW: What would you like to talk about the great writer? Maybe some details that we don't quite know.\n\nM: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true.\n\nW: Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening.\n\nM: Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money. He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers, and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi.\n\nW: Did Twain like that job?\n\nM: He loved this job, and many of his books show it. The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck.\n\nW: That's interesting!\n\nM: But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings. Like many other popular writers, Twain derived much of the materials for his writing from the wealth and diversity of his own experience.\n\nQuestion: What connection does the lecture suggest between Twain's travels and his writings? \n\n- His stories were inspired by his travels.\n\n- His travels prevented him from writing.\n\n- He traveled in order to relax from the pressures of writing:\nAnswer: His stories were inspired by his travels.",

Sounds a little strange.\n\nW: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n\nM: That's a pretty long span of time.\n\nW: I know. That's what she said, though.

Can you imagine?\n\nM: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n\nW: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans.

Now, what about the coach? I've been told that's fairly reasonable.\n\nM: Oh, it is. It costs twenty pounds in fact from London to Edinburgh.\n\nW: Hmm, that's not too bad.\n\nM: But it takes about ten hours.\n\nW: Oh, no. What about the train then?\n\nM: Let me see. It takes five hours ill fact from London to Edinburgh. It costs 62 pounds for a single.\n\nW: 62 pounds for a single ticket. Wow, that's a lot of money. You see, what I'd really like to do is to go by plane. Can you tell me about that?\n\nM: Yes, of course. Let me see, 78 pounds for a single. But it takes just over an hour.\n\nW: Really?\n\nM: Yes, you're there in no time.\n\nW: Wonderful. That'll be a wonderful start to the holiday.\n\nM: Shall I book a ticket?\n\nW: Well, look.

They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n\nM: That's a pretty long span of time.\n\nW: I know. That's what she said, though.

Can you imagine?\n\nM: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n\nW: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans.

What would you like to know?\n\nW: First of all, how was the standard weight used?\n\nM: Well, the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country. The department of weights and measures, we are a government agency. It's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales.\n\nW: How did you check the scales before?\n\nM: We have an old standard weight that we used to use. It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture.\n\nW: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less.\n\nM: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n\nW: How much did it cost?\n\nM: About 45 thousand dollars.\n\nW: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n\nM: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard. Think of the drug industry, for example, those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine.\n\nQuestion: Why was it necessary to replace the old standard weight? \n\n- Someone spilled water on it.\n\n- Someone lost it.\n\n- It was made of low-quality metal.\nAnswer: Someone spilled water on it.",

In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman?\n\nF: Is that the Walkman?\n\nM: No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial.\n\nF: How big is the whole thing?\n\nM: Oh, I'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms.\n\nF: Was it a success from the start?\n\nM: Funnily enough, a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around-and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price!\n\nF: Really?\n\nM: But, despite this pessimistic view, sales of this model far outnumbered projections.\n\nF: Well, you never can tell!

The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off.\n\nM: Indeed it has.\n\nF: And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well.\n\nM: Yes. At the end of 1982 Hattori-that's H-A-T-T-O-R-I--you know, the makers of Seiko watches-well, they unveiled an even smaller TV, around 3era, which is built into a wrist-watch.\n\nF: Incredible!\n\nM: It certainly is.

I've sort of done hotel work and I've also run a restaurant pub. And now I've got what you call a good old-fashioned pub.

I worked in quite a variety of pubs.\n\nW: What makes a good pub?

But the idea is, if you generate from your side, it's got to affect the other side, if you're getting the right customers in.\n\nW: Yeah I must say that's one thing that has always struck me about being a pub owner. I mean, a lot of people seem to think that it's a nice job, you know. Everybody says, \"Oh, I'd love to retire and get a country pub. \" But it seems to me that it's actually very hard work.\n\nQuestion: What does the man say about his involvement with pubs? \n\n- It provides him with career opportunities.\n\n- It helps enlarge his customer network.\n\n- It has been off and on for ten years.\nAnswer: It has been off and on for ten years.",

What would you like to know?\n\nW: First of all, how was the standard weight used?\n\nM: Well, the people in our department use it to check the scales all over the country. The department of weights and measures, we are a government agency. It's our responsibility to see that all the scales measure a kilogram accurately so this is the way we use to adjust the scales.\n\nW: How did you check the scales before?\n\nM: We have an old standard weight that we used to use. It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture.\n\nW: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less.\n\nM: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n\nW: How much did it cost?\n\nM: About 45 thousand dollars.\n\nW: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n\nM: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard. Think of the drug industry, for example, those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine.\n\nQuestion: Why was it necessary to replace the old standard weight? \n\n- Someone spilled water on it.\n\n- Someone lost it.\n\n- It was made of low-quality metal.\nAnswer: It was made of low-quality metal.",

Sounds a little strange.\n\nW: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n\nM: That's a pretty long span of time.\n\nW: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: \"Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.\"\n\nM: Some squid are really huge.

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nW: What does the term \"alternative energy source\" mean?\n\nM: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.\n\nW: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?\n\nM: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.\n\nW: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?\n\nM: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.\n\nQuestion: What do most experts agree on according to the man? \n\n- Oil will soon be replaced by alternative energy sources.\n\n- Oil production will begin to decline worldwide by 2025.\n\n- Oil consumption has given rise to many global problems.\nAnswer: Oil production will begin to decline worldwide by 2025.",

If you don't like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't go and use another.\n\nM: Some people who write to me say this. They say that if you didn't have a monopoly, you wouldn't be able to do the things you do. Well, I don't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized.\n\nW: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized?\n\nM: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that.\n\nW: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared?\n\nM: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America. Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year. But you see, those governments are preparing to pour money into the transport system to keep it going.\n\nW: So in a sense, you cope between two extremes. On the one hand, you're trying not to lose too much money. And on the other hand, you've got to provide the best service.\n\nM: Yes, you are right.\n\nQuestion: What does the man say threatens the existence of railways? \n\n- The low efficiency of their operation.\n\n- Competition from other modes of transport.\n\n- Constant complaints from passengers.\nAnswer: Competition from other modes of transport.",

But I bet it'll catch on elsewhere. Yesterday, over a hundred students signed up.\n\nM: Well, what is it?\n\nW: It's an experimental course. I registered for child psychology. All I have got to do is watch a twelve-week series of televised lessons. The department shows them several different times a day and in several different locations.\n\nM: Don't you ever have to meet with professor?\n\nW: Yeah.

That's why they came up with the program.\n\nM: The only thing is: doesn't it seem impersonal though?

Good evening!\n\nW: What would you like to talk about the great writer? Maybe some details that we don't quite know.\n\nM: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true.\n\nW: Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening.\n\nM: Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money.

The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck.\n\nW: That's interesting!\n\nM: But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings. Like many other popular writers, Twain derived much of the materials for his writing from the wealth and diversity of his own experience.\n\nQuestion: Why did Twain go west? \n\n- He wanted to be a journalist.\n\n- He liked the climate there.\n\n- He wanted to get away from the army.\nAnswer: He wanted to get away from the army.",

It had to be replaced because it was imprecise. You see it was made of poor quality metal that was too porous. It absorbed too much moisture.\n\nW: Oh. So when the weather was humid it weighed more and when it was dry it weighed less.\n\nM: Exactly. And that variation can affect the standards of the whole country. So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n\nW: How much did it cost?\n\nM: About 45 thousand dollars.\n\nW: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n\nM: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard. Think of the drug industry, for example, those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine.\n\nQuestion: What does Dr Thomas probably think about the cost of the new weight? \n\n- It is a small amount to pay for so much precious metal.\n\n- It is difficult to judge the value of such an object.\n\n- It is reasonable for an object with such an important function.\nAnswer: It is a small amount to pay for so much precious metal.",

Sounds a little strange.\n\nW: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n\nM: That's a pretty long span of time.\n\nW: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: \"Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.\"\n\nM: Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell?\n\nW: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size.\n\nM: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens?\n\nW: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine?\n\nM: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n\nW: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans. Maybe some of those monster stories are true.\n\nQuestion: What topic are the man and woman discussing? \n\n- Mating habits of squid and octopus.\n\n- The evolution of certain forms of sea life.\n\n- The study of marine shells.\nAnswer: Mating habits of squid and octopus.",

In fact, it can be flavored with tomato, cheese, or chocolate for instance\n\nM: How can it not taste fishy? Do you know how this snack food is made?\n\nW: First the fish is minced and cooked and fermented.

They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n\nM: That's a pretty long span of time.\n\nW: I know. That's what she said, though.

Can you imagine?\n\nM: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n\nW: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans.

In the spring of 1982 Sony introduced the Watchman?\n\nF: Is that the Walkman?\n\nM: No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV set with a tiny screen and aerial.\n\nF: How big is the whole thing?\n\nM: Oh, I'd say about 35 cm by 12 cm and it weighs only a couple of kilograms.\n\nF: Was it a success from the start?\n\nM: Funnily enough, a Sony executive said that no one would want to watch a TV while walking around-and also a slightly larger model could be bought for half the price!\n\nF: Really?\n\nM: But, despite this pessimistic view, sales of this model far outnumbered projections.\n\nF: Well, you never can tell! How big was the initial production?\n\nM: The company started with 2,000 units per month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982, but they still couldn't keep up with the demand.\n\nF: So I suppose they upped the production levels even higher.\n\nM: It was much more radical than that! In the spring of 1983 Sony pulled out all the stops and launched the Watchman all over again with a new model.\n\nF: Oh, what's it like?\n\nM: Well, it's 20 per cent smaller and the price is 25 percent less...\n\nF: Mmmm.\n\nM: and the components were designed from scratch.\n\nF: And what about production levels?\n\nM: They quadrupled to 20,000 units a month just for the Japanese market!\n\nF: Wow! The Watchman certainly seems to have taken off.\n\nM: Indeed it has.\n\nF: And I believe there were other Japanese companies as well.\n\nM: Yes. At the end of 1982 Hattori-that's H-A-T-T-O-R-I--you know, the makers of Seiko watches-well, they unveiled an even smaller TV, around 3era, which is built into a wrist-watch.\n\nF: Incredible!\n\nM: It certainly is.

Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month. That is, so different things get in their way and people don't stand up for their goals. They don't struggle for them. They let other forces push them around a little bit. Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest.

Now, Mr. Smith, what is the purpose of your survey?\n\nM: We wanted to explore how people around the world view obesity or being overweight. Actually, obesity has gone global.\n\nW: How did you do it?\n\nM: We interviewed 16,000 people in 16 countries.\n\nW: How large is the overweight population of the world according to your estimates?\n\nM: 1.6 billion including 18 million children under age 5.\n\nW: Really surprising, isn't it? And what are your findings about people's attitudes regarding obesity?\n\nM: Our survey found that people in Brazil feel the most pressure to be thin. 83% of Brazilians think there is too much emphasis placed on weight. French are most likely to blame Americans. They use American's fast food as an excuse for their overweight problem. Russians are most likely to blame their parents for obesity. They are followed by Germans and Indians. When asked who encouraged them to try to lose weight, the Swiss tend to exclude their doctor.\n\nW: Stay tuned for more about the NWHA survey, we will be back soon after the break.\n\nQuestion: Who are most likely to blame their parents for obesity? \n\n- Russians.\n\n- The Swiss.\n\n- Germans.\nAnswer: The Swiss.",

Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies, we seldom had a chance to get together as a family. But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot. We made plans for trips. We discussed each other's problems. After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful.

One of my good childhood memories was dinner with my parents and two sisters. Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies, we seldom had a chance to get together as a family. But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot. We made plans for trips. We discussed each other's problems. After a couple of months anyone who had to miss a family meal felt regretful. And now we all feel than we have been able to build stronger relationships within the family that we had before.\n\nQuestion: What did the children think about having dinner together at home? \n\n- They thought it was funny.\n\n- They disliked the idea at first.\n\n- They preferred eating with friends.\nAnswer: They thought it was funny.",

The thing nearly ripped off my arm. Well, once I peeled out of the drive way, the maniac started chasing me in his monster truck and nearly ran me off the road. And man, you could have told me that your car didn't have much gas 'cause it ran out in the middle of this dark parking lot, and I'm now hiding in the men's room of the gas station. Now, pick up the phone ... pick it up, ... Oh, no I can hear the guy outside and ... hey, and your phone is going dead ... Ah, man ... you might have told me that this thing couldn't hold a charge ... Ah man ... I should have stayed home and done the laundry ... I shouldn't have listened to your wacky idea of going out tonight ... Greg, Greg? Where are you?\n\nQuestion: What does the man say he should have done that evening instead? \n\n- He should have done his homework.\n\n- He ought to have relaxed and read a book.\n\n- He should have washed his clothes.\nAnswer: He should have done his homework.",

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nM: Nowadays, almost all job advertisements call for good communication skills. As a human resource manager, how do you see it?\n\nW: It is a term that is used regularly in the workplace. In my opinion, communication means interaction and is vital in business. It ensures smooth operation between staff members, employers and clients.\n\nM: Can you explain that more precisely?\n\nW: Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees, while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers.\n\nM: Do you say communication means talking to others?\n\nW: Well, communication doesn't always refer to conversations.\n\nM: Like what?\n\nW: For instance, written communication. It is very important in business. Mostly, being in the business area, communicating for the first time with someone, for example a client, is made through e-mails. Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional.\n\nM: Besides the work communication with business clients, how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues?\n\nW: Regardless of how good you are at your job, if you don't form at least basic relationships with those around you, it will ultimately affect your career success.\n\nM: What you've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization.\n\nW: Not really, the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior. Actually, some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members. You know, bad communication leads to misunderstandings. Meanwhile, the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients. To ensure that business continues to grow, a company's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees. This can never be the case if there is any miscommunication.\n\nQuestion: What do we learn from the conversation? \n\n- Miscommunication shall affect the growth of a company.\n\n- Career success depends on how an employee develops his job skills.\n\n- Companies hold social events to increase their sales.\nAnswer: Miscommunication shall affect the growth of a company.",

It took her two years before she could live independently again.\n\nW: That is why you had the thought to start the website?\n\nM: Exactly. Many other people with disabilities have the same need for assistance. So people with this need can come to the website.

Good evening!\n\nW: What would you like to talk about the great writer? Maybe some details that we don't quite know.\n\nM: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to.

But I bet it'll catch on elsewhere. Yesterday, over a hundred students signed up.\n\nM: Well, what is it?\n\nW: It's an experimental course. I registered for child psychology. All I have got to do is watch a twelve-week series of televised lessons. The department shows them several different times a day and in several different locations.\n\nM: Don't you ever have to meet with professor?\n\nW: Yeah. After each part of the series I have to talk to her and the other students on the phone, you know, about our ideas. Then we'll meet on campus three times for reviews and exams.\n\nM: It sounds pretty non-traditional to me. But I guess it makes sense, considering how many students have jobs. It must really help with their schedules, not to mention how it will cut down on traffic.\n\nW: You know,last year my department did a survey and they found out that 80 percent of all psychology majors were employed. That's why they came up with the program.\n\nM: The only thing is: doesn't it seem impersonal though? I mean, I miss having class discussions and hearing what other people thinks.\n\nW: Well, I guess that's why phone contact's important. Any way, it's an experiment.

So our department had the new weight made out of higher quality metal.\n\nW: How much did it cost?\n\nM: About 45 thousand dollars.\n\nW: 45 000 dollars? For one kilogram weight? That's more expensive than gold. Is it really worth that much?\n\nM: I'm sure it is. Industries depend on our government agency to monitor the accuracy of scales so that when they buy and sell their products there is one standard. Think of the drug industry, for example, those companies rely on high accuracy scales to manufacture and package medicine.\n\nQuestion: What is the conversation mainly about? \n\n- How to care for precious metals.\n\n- A standard unit for measuring weight.\n\n- The value of precious metals.\nAnswer: A standard unit for measuring weight.",

It ensures smooth operation between staff members, employers and clients.\n\nM: Can you explain that more precisely?\n\nW: Employers need to use excellent communication skills in order to get the very best out of their employees, while employees need to use communication skills when talking to clients as well as colleagues and employers.\n\nM: Do you say communication means talking to others?\n\nW: Well, communication doesn't always refer to conversations.\n\nM: Like what?\n\nW: For instance, written communication. It is very important in business. Mostly, being in the business area, communicating for the first time with someone, for example a client, is made through e-mails. Thus, writing becomes a way through which you can create a first impression. So your writing skills have to be very good and professional.\n\nM: Besides the work communication with business clients, how do you see the interpersonal relationships among colleagues?\n\nW: Regardless of how good you are at your job, if you don't form at least basic relationships with those around you, it will ultimately affect your career success.\n\nM: What you've mentioned seems to be about the individual but not the organization.\n\nW: Not really, the communication between individuals is part of organizational behavior. Actually, some big companies hold social events to encourage good communication between staff members. You know, bad communication leads to misunderstandings. Meanwhile, the employees should be equipped with good communication skills when they talk to clients. To ensure that business continues to grow, a company's clients should undoubtedly trust its employees.

        "data": "Dialogue:\n\nW: What does the term \"alternative energy source\" mean?\n\nM: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.\n\nW: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?\n\nM: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.\n\nW: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources?\n\nM: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.\n\nQuestion: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? \n\n- Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes.\n\n- Anything that can be used to produce power.\n\n- Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.\nAnswer: Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes.",

Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot.

Maybe some details that we don't quite know.\n\nM: OK, Mark Twain, who traveled quite a lot, often because circumstances, usually financial circumstances forced him to. He was born in Florida Missouri in 1835, and moved to Hannibal, Missouri with his family when he was about four years old. Most people think he was born in Hannibal, but that isn't true.\n\nW: Yes, I didn't know it if you don't tell us this evening.\n\nM: Well, after his father died when he was about twelve, Twain worked in Hannibal for a while and then left so he could earn more money. He worked for a while as a typesetter on various newspapers, and then got a job as a river pilot on the Mississippi.\n\nW: Did Twain like that job?\n\nM: He loved this job, and many of his books show it. The river job didn't last however, because of the outbreak of the Civil War. To avoid joining the army, he went west-California. Twain worked as a gold digger without much luck.\n\nW: That's interesting!\n\nM: But he did succeed as a writer, once that happened, Twain traveled around the country giving lectures and earning enough money to go to Europe. Twain didn't travel much the last ten years of his life, and he didn't publish much either. Somehow his travel inspired his writings. Like many other popular writers, Twain derived much of the materials for his writing from the wealth and diversity of his own experience.\n\nQuestion: What job did Twain especially love? \n\n- Typesetter.\n\n- River pilot.\n\n- Soldier.\nAnswer: River pilot.",

First of all, don't forget to turn it on.\n\nW: Got it!\n\nM: Then dial the number. And remember to press the \"send\" button.\n\nW: That's all?\n\nM: Pretty much. Just make sure to recharge the batteries every few weeks. And try not to drop it. It's fragile.\n\nW: Good advice.\n\nM: And one more thing: Be sure to pay the phone bill every month!\n\nQuestion: What is the conversation mainly about? \n\n- How to read the instructions.\n\n- How to use the cell phone.\n\n- How to pay the phone hill.\nAnswer: How to use the cell phone.",

What's next?\n\nW: It's hard to say where I'm going next, because my next record isn't finished.\n\nM: You used to go to acting classes before you got into music. Did you ever consider becoming an actress?\n\nW: That's what I wanted to do initially. I left school and joined a traveling theater company. We didn't have money for hotels. So we used to camp in parks. It was brilliant. Then I met William. He liked my voice and decided I should be a singer. It was queer because singing was something I never had in mind.\n\nM: Is it true that the best time of a woman's life is in her thirties?\n\nW: Well. Someone's been telling me that it really starts at forty. She is a wonderful woman. And she says the 30s are just as hard as the 20s, hut in a different way. They are just confusing. But when you get to forty, it's just extraordinary. Apparently, the whole world opens up.\n\nM: What would you like to achieve before you're... say.., sixty?\n\nW: I'd love to learn how to play the violin but not before I'm sixty. I'd like to do it in the next year or so. One of the first instruments I learned was the drums. And I am quite good at that coordination in a strange way.\n\nQuestion: When did Beth Orton begin singing? \n\n- After she met William\n\n- Before she went to acting classes\n\n- After she dropped out of school\nAnswer: After she met William.",
