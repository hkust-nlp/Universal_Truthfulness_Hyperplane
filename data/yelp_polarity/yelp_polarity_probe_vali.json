I had seen an ad in some mailer and knew that they offered sugar-free lemonade (for the diabetic husband). He was excited for that, as he loves lemonade and can never have it outside the home. Anyway, we were there around 7pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty bare so I was a little skeptical. A few kids hanging in the parking lot and one person waiting for their to-go order. The cashier was very friendly. As we were looking at the menu he asked if we had ever been there and then proceeded with samples of both regular and strawberry lemonade. He suggested the crispy Phillies, and had I read prior reviews, would probably had ordered that. \\n\\nWe went with the original Phillies. Husband had Buffalo fries and sugar-free strawberry lemonade, I had garlic fries and strawberry lemonade. The lemonades were decent. The regulars are stored already made in the fridge counter shelf. The sugar-free was made to order with Splenda. They blend the drinks, so that's a yummy plus for me.\\n\\nThe sandwiches were good. Not amazing, but not bad either. I'd maybe prefer my onions and green peppers to be not as soft as they were, but I'm really not too picky. They told us that Baby's Secret Sauce is good on the Phillies, which it was. A sweet bbq-ish sauce with a little kick. Husband really liked his fries...regular fries doused with buffalo sauce...I think Franks since there was a bottle on the table. They came with a side of ranch. The garlic fries were also good and came with sour cream...reminds me of a yummy baked potato. The staff came by our table a couple times to ask if all was well and to clear the trash.\\n\\nOur meals were the special - Philly, fries & drink for $8.49. Normal prices would make it a little on the pricey side, but it was good food.\\n\\nThe menu is diverse and I think they'd have something for everyone. They even have a peanut butter...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I told him I would only be interested in adding TV service with the existing internet service if I can get ESPN and sports channels. He assured me several times that I would get sports channels with just $30 extra on top of the internet bill. Our household doesn't watch much TV so I wasn't interested HBO or anything but he offered that as well. So I agreed to have TV service installed. I asked him to schedule it for the following Wed as I'm off on that day. So I run my errands and waited for the installer to come between 1-3. By 2:30, I was afraid he's not showing up. I looked up the email to double check the appt time and I realized he scheduled it for 9/25/14, Thur. I was like what?! Why did he schedule it for Thur when I asked him Wed? So that was the first frustrating part. So I called the customer service and rescheduled. Anyway, the installation tech was very friendly and helpful. He apologized he didn't get the order to install for multiple TVs which I told the \\\"\"marketer\\\"\" guy couple times that we have 3 TVs. Nonetheless, he took the time to properly install the service. Now is the most frustrating part...NO ESPN or any sports channels! When the markerter was making the sales pitch, I asked him and told him I'd only sign up if I get the sports channels and I mentioned ESPN multiple times. Why? Why? Why? Why did he waste my time and promised something totally false than what he delievered? When I called the customer service again, a couple different guys tried to resolve the issue. They were helpful and apologetic but I wasn't willing to pay $60+ extra for TV service we don't watch much of. So I ended up cancelling the cable right away.\\n\\nMaybe there's too much \\\"\"pressure\\\"\" for Cox marketers to make the sale? I really feel like he lied just to make the sale.

Not only do they taste good, but they are miniature works of art in themselves.  Pastry on the highest level is never overly sweet, and these are no exception.  The quality of ingredients is highly apparent the moment you take a bite into them.  Unfortunately our caloric allowances only gave room for my wife and I to order one apiece.\\n\\nThe strawberry shortcake was wonderful.  A very nice fruity strawberry flavor uncut by any of the red corn syrupy stuff you see in other places.  I had the vanilla eclair which was filled with vanilla pastry cream.  I think that they use Tahitian vanilla because it had a nice floral vanilla essence to it.  It was a full-bodied vanilla taste often not found in other places.  I did feel a little chalkiness to the texture which is from the starch they use to thicken it.  But, unless you make pastry cream on an ongoing basis, you may not notice it.\\n\\nDesserts here are not cheap.  At $7 a pop, they can cause sticker shock.  But are they sooo worth it.  Jean Philippe clearly demonstrates why he has received the award as Pastry Chef of the Year multiple times.

And what does the 'Supreme' mean?\\\"\" The response I got was simply, \\\"\"Dates\\\"\". That was pretty much how all our conversations with the waitress went. But terrible service aside, the biggest disappointment was the food itself. Nothing was necessarily BAD, but nothing was particularly GOOD or memorable either. They also seem to love their foam machine a little too much. While making cucumber foam, or pea foam is interesting, the textural element was used as more of a novelty than a compliment, as it was used on half the dishes. The meal ended appropriately. When asked, \\\"\"What's the 'Death by Chocolate'?\\\"\" The waitress responded, \\\"\"Mousse\\\"\". Turned out it was chilled and closer to ice cream. Overall I would have given the meal itself closer to a 3, maybe even 3.5...but such horrible service is inexcusable. They also did not open our wine until we asked, and they placed the white in a bucket, but with NO ICE!

Their BBQ isn't the best I've ever had, but it's certainly good for a quick-service counter joint, and I'd sooner eat here than the flavorless Famous Dave's and the stupefyingly overrated Memphis Championship BBQ.

I had the hash brown casserole thingy, which is also a side they serve with breakfast meals. It's yummy! Basically, it's cheesy hash browns. I also got turnip greens. They were OK, but not great. They were kind of watery & lukewarm. I get the impression most of the sides at Cracker Barrel are cooked well in advance and just sit around most of the day.

However, the fish market was not ready.  Both a younger and older man were still putting out fish on the ice.  After a period of time the older man asked if I minded waiting 5 minutes, and I said no.  I waited, and waited.  The younger man went down to the middle of the counter, and started waiting on people who were waiting also for fish.  I waited and waited.  The older man continued to ice fish.  After about 20 minutes the younger man came back, and asked a gentlemen that just walked up to the counter if he could help him.  I finally intervened and said I had been waiting for service since they opened, and apologized to the man next to me.  The younger man finally waited on me.  The people working behind the meat and fish counter definitely need training in customer service.

I know the difference between the two and felt insulted that they argued with me.

They seem to look down on you just because you are trying to get a deal on a dinner actually worth about price of voucher. Standard drinks from the bar are $14 each so keep that in mind before ordering.\\n\\nBecause of voucher, you can only chose select items on the menu. The crab cake appetizer was not bad. The sides mac and cheese and green beans we average at best. The main entre, 8oz steak filet was cooked perfectly and tasty. The champaign was not very good.

Also it was dinner for 2, but they automatically added $30 gratuity based on value of dinner, $198, so that was odd because service was not that good and food not worth the price.\\n\\nI will complain to Travelzoo.\\n\\nPro's:\\n- nice place\\n- decent service\\n- good steak\\n\\nCon's:\\n- $30 gratuity automatically added\\n- average food at best\\n- rude staff\\n- Eve club passes were supposed to be included but Eve went bankrupt 3 days ago.\\n- pricy average bar drinks\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

The Watermelon Margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.

It's not bad mind you, I just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.  The good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts I saw looked pretty high (mine was good).  The lobster tail was good.  I'd say comparable to Red Lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.

My wife and I recently stayed in the Riviera and I don't think we'll ever be staying there again because of our interactions with the front desk staff.  When I made the reservations for our room online they give you a choice for a double or king.  We selected a King in their premier room but found they had assigned us a double bed smoking room in their cheapest tower.  When I asked the lady at the desk about this with my wife by my side she snapped at me saying that king/double rooms aren't assigned until check in.  It makes no sense to me why they would even give you the option on their website to select the class of room/number of beds if it doesn't matter to them.  The rude, abrupt, and confrontational tone that we were treated with was keeping with the premier customer service of a vegas hotel that we have experienced in the past.  As it turned out she ended up taking our keys and changing the room without telling us what was going on.  We were surprised and confused when we entered our non smoking king room that we originally had reserved.  Why did there have to be an incident in the first place?  I'm still confused.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Super shocked to see a pretty busy boba place in the food court at the mall in Arizona.  My curiosity decided to give it a try.\\n\\nFirst off, their menu is SUPER overwhelming.  I'm definitely on the indecisive side when it comes to ordering anything, but they have so many different categories of \\\"\"teas\\\"\" such as Flirteas (fruity flavors), Naughteas (creamy flavors), etc. It's a fun concept for each drink to have a cool name, but it took me a while to decipher that menu.  I do like how they have three options for sizes of drinks.\\n\\nCLUELESS: This Flirtea drink was made with guava, watermelon, lemon, strawberry, and green.  It normally comes with lychee jelly (or \\\"\"gobi\\\"\" as they called it here), but I switched it out for boba without any charge.  Flavor and their quality of boba was surprisingly pretty good!!\\n\\nGOLDEN TEA BOBA: I think this was a make your own kind of tea option. Could not find it on their menu lol, shows how complicated it is.  Was recommended this and it totally reminds me of Lollicup's milk tea haha. \\n\\nPlenty of options and they can also adjust the amount sweetness per request.  What's unique here that I don't see often is that they have options for sweeteners in your drinks (i.e.: agave, honey, etc.) A little on the pricey side because it's in a nice mall, but that's expected.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I ordered the chicken soup as an appetizer - it was okay, although the broth tasted like beef broth.  My husband ordered the parmesan salad, which he liked.  I ordered the filet for dinner - it was incredibly salty and the portion was very small for the money we paid.  I'd much rather eat at the White Chocolate Grill - their filet is 10000000 times better.  My husband ordered the halibut (suggestion from waiter) and it was overcooked.  He told him it was overcooked. He offered to get a new one, but my husband said it was so bad he didn't want another one.  Here's the kicker... he only had 2 bites (yes, 2 bites) and they charged us for his meal!  When I asked the waiter if he'd made a mistake, he looked at me like I made the mistake.  He did remove it after I further explained that he didn't eat it (that was obvious), but without apology.  The manager NEVER came by to see what the issue was - not when the food was returned or when we had the issue with the check.  I would NEVER go to this restaurant again.  We are local and there were several tourists there - one couple was playing cards they had been waiting so long!

Pros: amazing decor, skilled massages, tea service afterward. Cons: staff is awkward. My sister's therapist answered TWO cell phone calls during her hour service. Therefore she was done about 12 minutes after the rest of us. Checkout took about 10 minutes because no one seemed to know how to work the credit card machine. Despite all the strangeness this was the best hour of my life. My advice is to wear a camisole and capri pants so your therapist can get to your skin easier.

I said that I wanted to purchase the battery and he (apparently excited about the impending storm) ran around in a circle towards the back.  I called out id like to get home before the storm to which he replied \\\"\"good luck\\\"\" and went into the back to get his phone. He returns and goes outside to take pictures, brushing past us again telling us to \\\"\"hang on\\\"\".

If you haven't tried it and don't know the concept here it is: you choose a pizza, salad, or pasta and load it up with any toppings you want for one price. And when I say any toppings I mean any toppings. We got meatball, pepperoni, bacon, ham, onions, jalape\\u00f1os and olives on our pizza. They had a ton of fresh toppings for the salad... asparagus, roasted red peppers, cilantro, chicken, romaine, mushrooms, apples. I could seriously go on and on. The dressing we got on the salad was a balsamic vinaigrette which was so yummy. Dare I say one of the most delicious o have had in some time? \\n\\nI was worried the pizza would take too long to make but they use a thin crust that they pop into a wood burning type oven and in three minutes, BAM! Your pizza is ready. \\n\\nStaff was friendly and knowledgeable. The price was very reasonable, especially considering that there is no limit to what you can pile on. $7.75 for a pizza, salad, or pasta. \\n\\nWe are thinking about making this our weekly pizza place.

More than that,  I hate wasting my money and time on a place that consistently disappoints.\\n\\nIt is remarkable how almost every review on the yelp has a common theme about the Orange Table:  a lack of service and a lack of speed.  No problem, most reviewers contend, as the food usually more than makes up for any wait or shoddy service.  My wife and I went this morning and got the expected level of service (ie, none) but were surprised at how bad the food was this time around:\\n\\nThe Greek Omelet was palatable but did not have feta cheese in it as advertised.  They used to put a pretty generous portion of butter on the toast but it seemed almost rationed. \\n\\nThe potatoes were raw, not underdone, but raw, horrid.  The cook might be busy as other reviews mention but at least cook your potatoes...petty basic.  They were hot as if they had put freshly cut potatoes in a skillet of hot oil, let them cook and coat for maybe a minute then put them on my plate with my cold sausage and even colder eggs.  So much for the cook's craft.\\n\\nThe coffee tasted extremely weak and watered down which was surprising since their coffee drinks are usually pretty good.  We have eaten there before over the years and have come to expect the lousy service but it is almost like they try to outdo themselves on:\\n\\nA.  Taking you to your freshly bussed table to wash it down with a soaking wet rag, leaving you with no utensils, water or napkins to bail the surface of your table out with.  From there, we waited fifteen minutes after being seated to get any attention at all.   Again, we expected this as it happened once before.\\n\\nB.  Refilling your horrible coffee without asking first.  If you have cream and sugar in your coffee aren't you supposed to at least ask?  I have never been a server so I really would not know.\\n\\nC.

I ordered one item, a soup item, total was $16. \\n\\nI ordered the Duck Soup and the serving was definitely for one person from the amount I received. the broth was pretty plain, a few stray green onions and a general salt flavor and not really a duck flavor. There were some duck pieces that were all bone pieces with little meat on them, the duck had an ok light flavor but I would enjoy a more savory taste definitely. I didn't like the texture of the noodles, best way I can describe it would be chewing on hair.  \\n\\nIf it didn't cost so much then I'd understand but even inside a casino this is still gouging, especially with the quality... $16 for one serving of duck bone salt soup, bad dragon, bad!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

This Britax B-Ready apparently warranted a scolding.  Carol was so incredibly rude and my stroller would have easily fit at a table- minus a chair.  What exactly is their procedure for wheelchairs or other special needs devices?  Do they simply not fit or are they not pleasing enough to the eye to accommodate?

It has both normal tables, and cozy, low tables with cushions vaguely reminiscent of a Japanese aesthetic.\\n\\nThis place really specializes in high-quality, straight loose tea.  It's a place you would go if you enjoy your tea without milk or sugar.  The menu is large and diverse.  Most importantly, the people here know how to brew tea properly--including both gong fu brewing (small, brief infusions with more leaf) and using multiple infusions western-style (longer brewing times).\\n\\nThe tea here is also very good quality--which, alas, is rare here in the U.S., even among specialty tea shops.  The selection is comprehensive.  You can find some esoteric teas that they don't have here if you look online, but you'll find this place carries all of the well-known teas and quite a few less-well-known ones.  In particular, there's even a good selection of oolongs, which can be hard to find in the U.S.\\n\\nWe had the Da Hong Pao and it was outstanding--each infusion had a totally different character.\\n\\nI'm not sure why the other reviewer objected to the bells--I thought they were very cute.  There is a little bell on each table and you can ring it when you want service.\\n\\nVery inexpensive to drink tea in, given how knowledgeable the staff is about brewing, and how the high-quality teas are good for making many infusions.  I definitely recommend ordering a pot.\\n\\nI am eagerly awaiting coming back to this place!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

She was on a strict diet consisting of lean meats and fresh veggies/fruit so she picked the restaurant. I had never been to Aladdin's and was pleasantly surprised by their emphasis on fresh, wholesome ingredients. I ordered Aladdin's favorite combo to get a taste of beef, chicken and kabob. When the meal was served, I was a litle disappointed in the quantity. There was about 2 ounces of each meat. Just enough for about three to four bites. It truly was a taste of each. For the cost, I was expecting a little more. However, the quality of the meal was exceptional. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The meats were juicy and tender. The meal also was served with a small mixed green salad on the side.True mixed greens, no iceberg here. I chose to try Aladdin's dressing which was tangy and delicious. Not being on a diet and having been deprved of chocolate all day, I decided on the most decident chocolate cake I could order. This tower of chocolateness had layers of choclate cake held toegther by chocolate mouse and chocolate ganache. A true choclate lovers dream. All in all, I will for sure head back to Aladdin's for a fresh, casual meal in a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Spicy food seemed like it'd be good for congestion, and I hadn't tried Torticas.  Well, Torticas was closed, so I continued down Green Street to Burrito King.  I remembered how the reviews were kind of mixed here on Yelp - either really high or really low - and decided to check it out.\\n\\nThe good: The server was quick and polite, and I had horchata right away.  And a basket of chips, which were the best part of the meal.  The prices are pretty much in line with a campus place, maybe a bit cheaper than some..\\n\\nThe rest: I tried to order a torta but I guess they didn't have any.  I ordered the fajita burrito instead, because it's in the name and since I didn't see anything about cheese sauce in the description.\\n\\nComes out with cheese sauce.  Smells kinda strange - almost like plastic?  The veggies just taste weird and are not crisp at all.  The meat is chewy and also has that weird taste that reminds me of plastic or chemicals.  Cheese sauce is really no good - salty but not much else in terms of flavor.  \\n\\nI ate about a third of it, trying to make sure I didn't just get a bad bite or something, but it tasted strange and unappealing.  Other than the weird flavor, it was pretty bland - and no hot sauce on the table at all, which is weird for a Mexican restaurant.\\n\\nI like Taco Bell (sometimes) so the food smelling like chemicals isn't always even a deal-breaker.  However, I also like Mas Amigos and Taco Loco for their cilantro and onion tacos and spicy flavors - and would definitely recommend them, or even Taco Bell, over Burrito King.  If you like food like Mas Amigos and do not want the most midwesternized Mexican I've had, then don't go here.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

So I told her ok I think it was either of these two shades, can I just get one sample from either type of foundation in that shade I guess.

She got in a huff and grabbed a completely different shade that was far too dark for me and gave me some miserable samples of each.. later on at home I didn't even have enough to apply on my whole face.

After the first game, I got her to follow me around and she did a lot better (Perhaps they felt differently about trying to pick on someone who is 6'5 and 250 Pounds and I could explain to her how to play). Secondly, it helps to have an understanding of how the game works. Most people score a lot of points because they can hit all four bases of the opposing colors. Even if you only have two teams playing, there are three colors and the other two colors opposing bases can still be shot. (I learned that after game 1). Despite some of these issues my girlfriend's daughter still had a good time and the staff did a great job of catering to her. They also try and break the teams up so it wasn't us against teenage laser tag assassins.  Kudos to them for that. All in all, it was a good experience.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

        "data": "Review:\nPho Kinh do...if not for the name, we probably never would have walked into this place.  After having eaten there, I must say that the name is probably the best part about the restaurant.  I love pho for the soup - I like my broth meaty, rich, textured, and so flavorful that you can burp it up hours afterwards and still taste it.  The soup here tastes like someone cracked open a can of beef broth (the kind that's on sale at the supermarket for 55 cents), heated it up slightly, and then dunked some noodles in there.  The soup was lukewarm, and tasted like msg water.  Ironically, even though the soup was not hot, the beef was already fully cooked (if not overcooked) when it came out - it was chewy and tasted like it had been cooked hours ago.  The summer rolls were cheaper than some of the other places we've tried in vegas, but they weren't anything special - the skin on the ends was hard and uncooked on one of my rolls.  As a side note, their banh mi looked interesting (lots of different combinations, including some with egg!) and might be worth a try.\\n\\nAs for service...we sat down and were not handed menus.  I eventually ended up grabbing the menus myself after unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waitress.  It also took awhile to order, and the food came fast, but that's probably because they hardly heated up the soup at all.  The one thing I will say is that once we finally got our menus and placed our orders, the waitress was very friendly and had a good attitude.  That being said, I don't really care if I have to serve myself at a pho place as long as the broth is slurpy delicious.  \\n\\nTo summarize: don't come here to eat the pho soup.  It is not anything dac biet.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

But out first came the salad that had way too much dressing on it (dressing was totally meh). When my sea bass was delivered I was so incredibly disappointed. It was this teeny little flat square that had been seared with way too much oil (I had even asked that they skip the butter lemon sauce because instinctively I knew it would be swimming in it). It was totally greasy, yet at the same time undercooked. I didn't know that the sides were served family-style so I thought that was all I got but it wouldn't have mattered. The side of vegetables was totally greasy as well and not creative in the least. Totally bland. The rice is exactly as all the other reviewers have described: Rice a Roni meets Zatarains. Totally bland and  you cannot convince it didn't come from a box. My friend's paella was terrible. Bland, overcooked and soupy. My other friend didn't even eat half of her seafood meal. And the final straw was when I got my check and saw that they charged $39.95 for my fish. Wha???? Pah-lease. Those are the same prices as Wild Rosemary and their food is absolutely stupendous and worth every penny. So fresh, so creative. This was total junk and a meal I could have gotten for half the price at Max and Erma's, or even better yet, Eat-n-Park.

As I was checking the website for what I can bring into the park i noticed it said 11. Then I checked the yelp reviews and yelp said they open at 10. I wanted to be there when it opened so I could get a shade area in the grass. At this point I was thoroughly confused so I decided to call and listen to the message. The message seemed to be updated since they posted the date and time their summer weekend hours started, which was 10. So we got there at 9:45. The parking lot was empty so I went to the front to see if hours were posted. On a chalkboard it said they are open at 11. As I was walking back to the parking lot someone who was operating a leaf blower told me it opens at 10. I explained that the sign said they open at 11 but he assured me they open at 10. I don't think he works for the company so I disregarded what he said. When I saw someone in a golf cart I asked him. He was wearing a big surf shirt so I knew he would have accurate information. He told me it opens at 11. I told him that I checked the phone message and that it said they open at 10. He shrugged his shoulders at me and said, \\\"\"well, we open at 11.\\\"\"  He absolutely didn't care about the inconvenience that I had experienced even after I explained it to him. He was actually very rude to me then drove away in his golf cart. The general manager, Bob, is in serious need of customer service training. He does not care about the customer, customer satisfaction or his job. \\n\\nBesides that, as soon as I entered the park I noticed that the trash cans were already completely full.

We love Indian food and were excited to discover this place.\\nFirst and foremost: they had two groups of 8 having dinner that night. I know they were groups of 8 because it took 1 hour 45 minutes for our food to arrive due to a simply terrible service. so yes, I had the time to count. They could have brought us some bread... or SOMETHING, or told us about the delay, but we were ignored the whole time. I hoped that the appalling delay would be compensated by great flavor. I am reading the other reviews here and I'm confused: did you know butter chicken should not taste like sugar was dropped in it, or have you just skipped on the authentic Indian your whole life? I don't mean to sound pretentious (oh well...) but the flavor was not there, the food tasted like something I could have made in my slow cooker at home, but LESS flavorful. So disappointed! \\n\\nOn the flip side, the Samosa I had as an appetizer was good! So that earns you a star. And a pity star.

I was like \\\"\"I know that place-- Au Pied Du Cochon, and I've been dying to go!\\\"\" to which he replied \\\"\"Okay, let's go!\\\"\".\\n\\nSix months later we were living together and took our first trip together to Montreal. Naturally, Au Pied du Cochon was on our dance card!\\n\\nNow, the first time we went, the service and food were all great. We had the Foie Gras Croquemensis, the Poutine, Codfish fritters and the Duck in a Can. Admittedly, a heavy meal for the end of July, but we enjoyed. The presentation was stupendous and I couldn't get over how much foie gras was on the poutine!! A nap afterwards is mandatory.\\n\\nThe second time we went this past August, the service was not so hot. Our server wasn't able to explain the menu or specials very well. This skill is more like a necessity at APDC because of the nature of the menu items (many of them contain organs and culinary preparations that are not common to all diners) and also because of the language barrier. Even the English menu has a lot of French on it. So it helps to have a server who is well versed in his culinary terminology and can dole out a few recommendations. sadly, this guy could not. And I really felt bad for him. I'm a server, too, so I know that people have off nights and sometimes things are just crazy and it can be hard to present things well when everything is going haywire around you. He did mean well. \\n\\nBut all was not well in Pig-Land this night...\\n\\nThe food and the presentation of it left much to be desired this time around. The poutine was slopped on the plate with streaks of gravy all over the edge that no one had bothered to wipe and all the food appeared crowded or simply thrown on the plate. Originally, I had ordered the sweetbreads they had on special, but they ran out as soon as my order was placed so I opted for the liver, which was cooked well and delicious.

Growing up, my relatives have always been obsessed with crab legs and other seafoods that you have to work for to get to the good stuff.  As I got older I saw that it wasn't just my family, it was pretty much everybody that was obsessed with peeling their food.  I just did not see the point in having to work so hard for your food!\\n\\nAnd then there was Hot N Juicy.  Admittedly, my first visit here was made reluctantly.  If I didn't care much for crab, why would I care for crawfish?  The answer is easy: the Hot N Juicy Special sauce.  Medium spice.  I went from avoiding seafood that requires my hands to eat, to getting serious cravings for Hot N Juicy.  That sauce is spicy and leaves a (pleasant) burn on your lips as you continue to eat.  The garlic flavor can get pretty strong as it leaves it's mark on your breathe, and infiltrates every article of clothing you're currently wearing.  You'll probably end up doing laundry as soon as possible.  But all of that doesn't matter...because the sauce is worth it.\\n\\nMy current favorite is the shrimp.  Crawfish is good, but their size is inconsistent.  Not that that's the restaurants fault or anything, it's just that the first time I went, the crawfish were pretty darn big.  But with each subsequent visit...their size diminished.  But it's okay, I have my shrimp to keep me satisfied.  Next time I go I'll have to try the crab.\\n\\nSo has my mind changed about seafood?  No not really.  As it stands, I'm really in it for the sauce.  No Hot N Juicy special, no seafood peeling/cracking for me.  Five stars for instilling a craving that I never thought I would have, and having consistently delicious sauce.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

The new owners have no idea what their doing and trying to the flip the palms into one of the clubs on the strip is a big no no. The palms has a reputation and they should uphold that. This is really sad what this hotel has become.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Sometimes you just really don't want a place where anybody knows your name. Sometimes you want to be a girl, alone at a bar, drinking a bourbon and reading a book. And Industry fits the bill perfectly. It's a good-looking place with a giant bar area and plenty of table seating -- but who cares about that when you want to eat alone? It's not too dark, there are lots of TVs, the music is a mystifying mix of Vampire Weekend, Beyonce and 80s, the servers range from charmingly social to semi-efficiently disinterested (which I'm ok with), the food is decent -- I like the salads and the flatbreads but have heard mixed things about everything else -- and the drinks are interesting. Basically, it's the perfect combination of safe and anonymous, with the added benefit of a competent kitchen. \\n\\nThe cocktails tend to be on the sweet side and for some reason the person who designed the menu decided to name both a drink and a salad the Menlo Park, which makes for some confusion and seems like a ridiculous oversight. \\n\\nPricing is reasonable: many menu items are under $10.00. The cocktails are also reasonable but, given the sweetness, not really worth it. Or maybe they are. It depends what you like.\\n\\nBasically, this is a place I go by myself.

Considering the way she would reply to reviewers, I figured she was a classy lady, which is important to me as I'm baring everything intimate to a virtual stranger ... I'm even tentative with my OB-Gyn.  Sure enough, Stacey's a very cool and classy lady and her waxing spa mirrored her class act--it's extremely clean, set up for the customer's privacy and comfort, with a contemporary upbeat and positive vibe.\\n\\nStacey made me feel comfortable from the start--we chatted like friends who were catching up, despite the exposed position you're in while chatting LOL.  I was in and out of there quickly, yet never felt rushed and her work was so precise.  I took a couple of extra-strength tylenol before going in, nothing else -- and honestly all I felt was a couple of momentary stings.  I had experienced more hurt and inflammation with the old strip style bikini wax, but this hard-wax full brazilian was relatively painless and carefree for me!

I was paying attention to your after-wax instructions.)  Also, just a note: they don't push any products on you, but they sure have some good stuff, nice specials, a 5-day free touch-up (if you need it, I didn't) and extremely reasonable pricing.\\n\\nMahalo, TBS and Stacey, for being the absolute best!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Everything that came out tasted wonderful. I honestly didn't wanna look like a mcfatty pig in front of some of the executives I was dining with so I kept my portions on my plate pretty small.

So simple, coral with a gold glitter fade. Which ended up being half my nail in gold glitter gel, no gradient, no actual \\\"\"fade\\\"\". Then they charged me $95, five dollars extra for an extra coat of glitter gel polish half way down my nail. I pulled my phone out and showed them what a fade on gel manicure is supposed to look like, she finally agreed to take it off. The owner gave me an attitude and was rude when I asked her how long a 3D flower lasts. She rolled her eyes, half laughed at me, annoyed and said \\\"\"it lasts a long time.\\\"\" in a condescending tone. Mind you, I've never tried 3d ANYTHING before and was excited to try it. I should have left right there. She didn't use the right kind of flower, my toes have Hawaiian flowers and my hands have ugly white roses. Wt.... If I didn't have a Bootcamp class I would have made them do it over or refused to pay $100 for such ugly nails. Which took almost 3 hours!!!! I get angry thinking about it. And looking down at my nails. Everyone keeps saying how much I got ripped off. Robbed and nothing pretty to show for it.

Which I use to enjoy watching. That is sad=T. \\nCustomer service is not good either. The first room we had had a wet carpet floor, so the front desk gave us another room. Room 664 did not have soap etc. I had to call front desk to get soap. The hotel is outdated and needs new carpets. \\nUpon checkout we had to pay a resort fee of 18 dollars per night plus a 12% tax rate which could not be waived. Even though the rooms for two nights is suppose to be comp. There were no signs , front desk did not even tell us there is a resort fee , etc. What is the point of a free couple of nights at Rio if you still have to pay for a resort fee. Complimentary means free not HIDDEN FEES!  \\n\\nTo put this in perspective .... The Gold Coast Casino which is next door DOES NOT charge you a dime when they give you complimentary nights. Gold Coast staff is friendly, have good restaurants open late at night, and provides shuttle services. And oh yeah...they have signs all over the front desk telling you there is a resort fee of 9.99 per night so you are aware of the fees. \\n\\nThe good:\\nThey have a free shuttle that takes you to the strip every 30 minutes until 1am. Hotel is outdated but is in ok condition.\\n\\nThe bad:\\nResort Fees are hidden.\\nNot friendly front desk.\\nNot not on the strip.\\nHotel is out dated.\\nNo good places to eat late at night in the hotel except Burger King (Yuk!).\\n\\nWould I stay here again?

We paid $320 to play both courses on the same day.  Here are my thoughts.\\n\\nEither courses lacked any real feature.  They were flat and boring.  No elevation changes, no scenic desert scape and the holes were generally boring in design.  Just a flat course in the middle of the desert.  There are plenty of better courses in Phoenix that are cheaper and way more entertaining and challenging for much lower price (500 club, ASU Karsten, Papago, Dove Valley, etc...).  If you want to pay this kind of price and enjoy the scenery as well as challenge, try TPC Scottsdale, Ocotillo, Raven, Triology, Troon North for starter).  I'm not opposed to high green fees just as long as they provide value.\\n\\nOn the day of the course, the greens were rock hard and didn't hold a single ball - not even a nine iron on to the front of the green.  When we got done, none of us walked away with 'oh, what about that hole' with any enthusiasm.  For the price we paid, this was not much better than a muni track.  Sorry TalkingStick, you're just a stick.\\n\\nOn the positive, the staff was generally friendly and helpful.  However, the Marshall did nothing to keep the guys in front of us at pace with the group in front of them.  I suppose that's why they took the 'Marshall' tile away and gave them more benign 'player assistant' title.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

To add to the frustrating on the return flight, after having boarded and ready for take off, the flight attended instructed the entire plane to de-board since there was some hydraulic fluids leaking from the airplane.  After sitting at the airport awaiting for several hours we were finally put on a new plane.  Only to be hours late back home.  I've flown spirit several times before and really did not have a bad experience.  But after this one I will be sure to never book a flight with Spirit again.

This place, however, has changed my mind about this frozen delicacy just a bit. Serving gelato, froyo, and icecream, Kem CoBa has a wide assortment of almost any delicious frozen treat you're craving on a hot summer's day. My bf and I stopped by this place after hitting up Montreal's two big bagel shops (Fairmont and St. Viateur's) since we were melting from the afternoon heat and needed something cool and refreshing. My bf got a scoop of matcha green tea gelato and I got a scoop of mango. Both were delicious! The matcha tasted just like green tea should; earthy, grassy, fresh, slightly sweet but not overpoweringly so. The mango was tart, light, also the perfect level of sweetness, and again, very fresh (like it was made from fresh mangos).\\nIf you're stopping by Fairmont bagels, you might as well stop by here on your way down the street cause they're literally a few steps from each other (I think, if I recall correctly, they're only separated by one shop in between).\\n\\nFood: 4/5 -- delicious!\\nService: 4/5 -- friendly, prompt, welcoming\\nAtmosphere: 4/5 -- clean, brightly colored, fun and quirky (a wall of bubbles), but no seating area (although there's plenty of benches outside to sit on so it's not a problem)\\n\\nOverall: 4/5 -- great!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Plus, we were staying at the Mirage and we could stay on the property.  HOWEVER.  Our excitement didn't last long.  \\n\\nThe ambiance was fine.  Very cool loungey vibe.  They were pumping club tunes in the background.  It was not super loud, so it wasn't offensive.  It seemed most patrons were relatively snazzed up in terms of dress code.\\n\\nThis was our third day in Vegas, so by then, I was already pretty desensitized to the inflated prices all over town.  Japonais definitely kept with that theme.  My husband and I shared two pieces of uni sashimi, seafood tempura, kobe carpaccio, dessert and two cocktails and the bill came out to about $100.  The food was good. Not earth-shatteringly awesome, but good.  I was not full, though, and my dining companion who ordered two plates of the kobe and rock strip steak was definitely still hungry (each were only approx. 2oz  of meat).  I was glad to be able to order a big Asahi Super Dry, which was a somewhat reasonable $10.\\n\\nMy main beef with the place was the service.  It was terrible.  We had approximately four servers who were working with our table, but they appeared to be working independently of each other - one couldn't handle the bill, one couldn't tell us the status of an entree, etc..  They brought the food out in such a weird order.  We got our uni and seafood tempura simultaneously, then the carpaccio came pretty closely thereafter.  My husband and I were finished eating before our friends got the majority of their food.   Three of us were finished before the fourth got her entree.  We had to inquire about it, and it still took time to get it.  \\n\\nI heard some ladies complain to the staff that the bathroom was out of TP, which I think is also an indication of the level of service there.\\n\\nWould I go there again or recommend it to anyone?  No.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

A fan of teriyaki bowls and after seeing the $3.49 special sign, I decided to stop in. I'm never one to shy away from hole in the wall food and thought the $4 was worth it. A bit dark when you walk in. There was a guy sitting at a table to the left. When I walked in he got up and went behind the counter and turned on the lights above the food. Looked like they had a decent lunch rush so they must be pretty popular in the area (only know this because the trays were pretty empty and the register had a lot of receipts still attached to it. So I though I may have just stumbled upon something good. Ordered the bowl and he went into the back to fill up the to-go bowl with white rice. He came back out to front trays and topped off my rice with a bunch of teriyaki chicken. Not a bad portion for $3.50. The meat was actually pretty tender and juicy but lacked much flavor. Definately needed more teriyaki sauce. The rice was fine, no complaints.\\nNot a horrible spot, might give it another try and have a combo so I can try the other items they have. I wouldn't recommend going outside of prime hours as the food probably sits. I stopped in around 1:30pm. \\nI only give 2 stars because nothing stood out about the meal or the place and the guy was grumpy and looked almost pissed off he had to get up to help me.

The first time you experience one, you'll understand why the eateries are near and dear to many people's hearts. At these Brazilian steakhouses, gauchos encircle your table to offer you various delectable cuts of beef, lamb, chicken and pork. The format is no-menu, single fee, all-you-can-eat extravaganza.\\n\\nThe price at this Fogo in particular as of this writing here in Phoenix is $42.50 per person, which is a bargain considering the amount and quality of food offered. Once you're seated, you're offered drinks and then you're free to immediately indulge in one of the most high-class 'salad bar' experience you'll ever have. Really, calling it that doesn't do it any justice.\\n\\nAfter you've had your fill of vegetation and the like, you may begin the onslaught of meat. There is a small card that is next to you that you flip to 'green' to attract the gauchos and 'red' when you'd like to take a break. Come to Fogo expecting to practice gluttony. You will savor mouth-watering cuts of meat including fillet, top and bottom sirloin, lamb chops, leg of lamb, bacon wrapped fillet and bacon-wrapped chicken, pork sausage and ribs and others. They're all exceptional though you may like some things more than others.\\n\\nThere are a few words of warning. You will consume a lot of food. The meats are highly salted to bring out the most of their flavor and the beef is cooked to the rare side. In short, this is not a health food experience. This is for the meat lover in a meat-eating mood.\\n\\nYou can feel free to intersperse the vegetables at the salad bar while eating the meat. As well, a few sides are provided: garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried bananas. Fogo has many fine deserts though I tend to stick with the recommended Papaya Cream, which is a lighter fare after consuming pounds of meat.\\n\\nAs for the rest of Fogo, the setting is noisy but gorgeous. There's always a festive atmosphere about the place. With all the hustle...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

How can words even do justice in accurately portraying the rich creamy clouds of ricotta cheese, the carnivorous festival of pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs layered about providing you with a new and exciting flavor combination with every single bite. The fact of the matter is, that I can't. I can't begin to describe how truly good this pizza really is. The only thing you can do is experience it for yourself. Drop whatever it is that you are doing right now.  Go to Ciao Ciao, order a pie, and insert it into that large flapping hole in your face with the lips and teeth and go ....MMMMMMM.\\n\\nCiao Ciao is the best place to get pizza in Las Vegas period.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Overall, I would give it a B. I'm not comparing NC BBQ to Vegas BBQ, but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the prices were high.\\n\\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese. I should have noticed the word \\\"\"pulled\\\"\" pork as it has a different mouth feel than chopped pork. The pork itself was smoky and tender. Long strips of pork inside a hoagie roll. I added coleslaw to the top which was a mistake. The coleslaw (ugh) had chucky bits of cabbage stalk, jalapenos, carrots, corn and I swear I saw bacon in the mix. It wasn't sweet and it wasn't salty; It added nothing to the meal. The mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious. Oddly enough, it tasted like potatoes au gratin I just bought from the store. \\n\\nAside from that awful coleslaw experience I would go back but not to order the pulled pork sandwich. The prices are a bit high and I wish tried something that was just amazing! I will have to go back when they aren't charging full prices such as after 5pm.

There are two registers, but only one was open. We waited 15-20 minutes to place our order. What was disappointing is that the place was almost empty and there were 5 or so staff standing around waiting for food to come out of what appears to be a very small kitchen for the size of the restaurant.

A colleague warned me not to buy anything in Vancouver beforehand, as it would undoubtedly be overpriced. She told me about the 2-storey Forever 21 in the Fashion Show Mall that would meet our needs perfectly. Although I typically don't like stores that mass-produce cheap, throwaway clothes (oh the wastefulness!) I thought this would be a perfect place to prepare for a night out.\\n\\nWhen we arrived in the city, we dropped our things off at the hotel and made the trek up the Strip to Forever 21. As others have mentioned, the selection is outrageously big. Overwhelming, even. The group of ladies I was with easily found armfuls of dress possibilities, which we promptly brought over to the change rooms to try on. This is where the trouble began. Now, I'm a well-proportioned and curvy lady, and I normally don't have too many troubles finding flattering clothes. Although everything I tried on looked great on the rack, absolutely NOTHING looked good on my body. If I weren't so confident beforehand, I would have felt terrible about myself, as I'm sure many other ladies have before me. I think it's just a matter of the quality of design and materials being ultra-low, which of course is how they can charge $15 for a dress.\\n\\nIn short: yes, there are rooms and rooms full of clothes, but they're all cheap (and not in the good, \\\"\"wow, look at this steal of a deal!\\\"\" way). At the end of it all, all I purchased was a few pairs of cute socks with moustaches, foxes, and owls on them. I'm glad to say I had packed a beautiful back-up dress from Anthropologie, and I didn't see a single other person wearing it while I was out. As for the clothes from Forever 21, it seemed like everyone else in the clubs and casinos was wearing their dresses, and they all looked cheap doing it.\\n\\nIndividuality FTW!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Ok, being a pizza snob it's not Settebello. But sometimes you want a pizza without fuss that you can customize and with a thin crust. And that's what I got, a pizza with a reasonably thin, hand tossed crust. I watched the guy toss it and he's good at it. And when you add fresh veggies and tomatoes and more it's not going to be as dry as a cracker, it's going to be kind of wet. (Notice I said wet, not soggy, there's a vast difference there!)  I ordered a NY Combination, tossed the bell pepper, added green olives and tomatoes. What I got tasted great. The green olives added just the right amount of saltiness so it was like a combination meets a Mediterranean pizza. It was good. But I wasn't the only one liking it as my 2 year old didn't spit it out and he ate very good here. (This is also one place where I even ate the crust as it was really good)\\n\\nMy wife ordered manicottis which I tried and liked but had to stay away from as I had that massive pizza to enjoy. Our appetizer included mushrooms, zucchini, and mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was off for me but my wife loved it, and the mushrooms and mozzarella sticks were quickly gone.  \\n\\nService was really good. I did have one time I had to ask for an ice tea refill but that was it. Service with a smile? Yep, got it here in abundance. Oh and one other little detail, the fork I was using had seen better days. But beyond that, I have nothing else I can gripe about. \\n\\nOverall, I liked this place. And I will be back.

True, the Hooters casino is as poorly cleaned and maintained as one of their restaurants, but the rooms were not quite so bad as the typical Hooters restroom and one has to expect a certain griminess to go with the low room costs - that could potentially be some of the fun of the aesthetic that Hooters touts, I suppose.\\n\\nWe came to the Hooters casino because some friends were already booked here and we wanted to spend some time with them after we had rested some, and enjoy exploring Las Vegas.  They, my partner, and I had just spent a week first on a grueling 1900 mile road trip from Austin to northern Nevada and then camping in a barren desert for the Burning Man art festival - and figured it would be nice to spend some time with each other just decompressing.  So we decided we would pay ahead for a room with a bed big enough for both of us, knowing that it would take all day to drive through Nevada from Black Rock Desert to Las Vegas.\\n\\nWe paid ahead for a room with a King size bed for three nights, got up at 7:30 am and drove all day from Burning Man in North Nevada, got in around 11 pm exhausted and haggard, looking forward to nothing more than just crawling into a clean comfortable bed with each other and relaxing, before spending  - and they tell us that they will only put us in a room with two doubles and told us in a bored voice, \\\"\"too bad, even though you paid ahead for a king room, it is first come first served.  Tough, there is nothing we can do, that's policy.\\\"\" In effect, you can only get what you paid for if you come at checkin time - paying for the room ahead of time does not actually secure it.  \\n\\nOur friends were, of course, screwed over by the same policy and were no happier about it.\\n\\nAvoid any business that does not deal honestly with its customers like this - this is worse than what you would reasonably expect from Hooters and Las Vegas combined.

They have your traditional drive through carwash, but what you don't see is that if you buy the traditional car wash (around $7) you will get a hand wash and hand dry...once you pull up to the car wash, 1-2 attendants will come out and scrub your car down really really well. After you go through the wash, they will do a very good hand dry. They will do this even if you get the cheapest wash offered. All you need to do is tip the attendants. Seriously, you can get a hand car wash for anywhere between $10-15 depending on your tip. I've not seen anything like this before. However, after I stopped by my first time (have been back a few times since) I always see Limo's there. This is where many of the limo's in town get their wash, I can imagine its because of the price and quality. Additionally, you can get a hand wash pretty much anytime of the day. I've gotten one as late as 11pm (after parking under a tree all day). This is definitely a gem in the town full of car wash joints....\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I got a lunch to go order of Yellow Curry / Chicken Hot (my stand bys), I had them add bell peppers and Pad Thai / Chicken Hot.

My only qualm was that there were only two pieces of green onion in my pad thai? WTH?! Thankfully I had some at home so I could doctor it up. Next time I will ask for extra green onion. The flavors and spices were perfect.

Third, there are so many students in the class and the instructor is all over the place so new people haven't the slightest clue of what to do.  The only way I was able to do at least something was to watch the person next to me.  The instructor provided NO instruction that made sense for beginners and conducted class like everyone was a veteran.  There needs to be separate beginner classes for sure along with some material or something on their web site that explains what you need and should bring.  The instructor should have smaller classes and be cognizant of what special requirements the students need (such as carpal tunnel and alternate positions).  Very disappointed with the setup and lack of instruction.  Also, after 7pm, there is no one manning the front desk and they lock the front door so you'll have to unlock and leave yourself if you happen to leave early.  If you do happen to go, here are some tips: 1) show up 15-20 minutes early your first time for paperwork 2) bring a yoga mat, yoga mat towel, sweat towel and bottle of water 3) highly suggest sports bra of sorts for the women and only shorts (no shirt) for the men 3) wear flip flops or slip-on/off shoes 4) leave purse/valuables/stuff in the car or at home 5) if using a card for payment, get some kind of small wallet that you can clip to your yoga mat or wrist 6) inside the classroom there are no shoes allowed and little or no talking 7) the room is a long rectangle and if a lot of folks are there, be prepared to be close to your neighbor.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

The fingers are a little on the small side but that's nothing unusual.\\n\\nI'm giving Guthrie's two stars because the service was horrible and the restaurant was filthy. After ordering, we were never given drink cups. We get our food, still no drink cups. I go up to the counter and the girl behind it who was running both the counter and drive thru, completely ignores me. One of the cooks in the back asks what I need, tells her, I stand there for about 2 minutes and nothing. I decide to sit back down and wait, another 5 minutes go by, still no drink. I go up to the counter again, the same gentleman asks what I need, tells her yet again and they actually start a mini argument right in front of me about how busy she is and can't grab the drinks! The drive thru may have been busy but it was dead inside with only one other customer, who also did not get their drinks after they ordered. That's got to be fixed, it doesn't take but 30 seconds for her to grab a cup and ice.\\n\\nThe restaurant was also pretty dirty, all the tables were visibly greasy and had either salt or some sort of trash on them.

I actually watched my drink sit at the waitress station at the bar with the ice melting in it for a while before it was brought to me.  \\n\\nI had the bavarian pretzels, which were decent by themselves, but the jalepeno sauce served with it was chunky and old, and had thickened to an almost inedible point.   \\n\\nAs for the sliders, they were nothing special, and I thought, a bit over-priced for what they were.  I wasnt thrilled about the beef the burgers were made with, and it wasnt seasoned at all.   Absolutely avoid any slider with a Turkey Burger inside, it smelled old and.....stale? rancid? \\n\\nThe one shining point of my visits, and the only reason this place gets a second star is because of the cheese curds.

For dessert, the green tea creme brulee.\\n\\nThe toro was amazing and should be the #1 reason why you come here.  It was soft, smooth, and slightly sweet, as perfectly fresh toro is supposed to taste.  $25 for 6 huge slabs?!  Yes, please!\\n\\nThe homemade tofu is reason #2 why I'd come back.

They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My \\\"\"large\\\"\" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the \\\"\"fresh\\\"\" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.\\n\\nThis place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.\\n\\nI wouldn't go back here.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Happy Berry has become another one of the few places that is receiving a 1-star rating from this usually generous and forgiving reviewer.\\n\\nAppearance-wise, I expected good things from Happy Berry, which looks bright, colorful, and inviting when you're looking inside. Step in and it seems clean enough upon first glance. So just going off of what I saw, I was expecting a nice, tiny local shop - what wasn't to like?\\n\\nIn addition to the usual concerns about the shop's toppings that I have in most froyo shops, I had two big problems with this place. One annoyance was that you're not able to get half of the yogurt flavors yourself here. Call me crazy but if you can't get all of them yourself, then why even bother making some flavors self-serve? All or nothing, guys. But whatever, that's nothing we can't deal with and certainly not worth a 1 star rating.\\n\\nThe big problem I had here was that the yogurt I ate was practically tasteless. I mixed the vanilla and cookies n' cream - my favorite combination - and added some of my favorite toppings. After excitedly digging in, I was disappointed to find that it was like I was eating the ghost of my favorite treat. The only part of my snack with any real taste was the toppings. The froyo itself was just...bland. I don't even understand how that's possible since frozen yogurt is shipped in liquid form and then put into a machine. But somehow, it happened, and this froyo lover ended up leaving Happy Berry feeling very unhappy indeed.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

We reached Vegas late the night of December 6th and found that we got a double bed even though we had asked for a king during reservation. A quick call to the Mlife counter and we were whisked away to another room with a king bed and a great view of the strip on one of the higher floors.\\nGambling was fun at the Mirage and we spent almost 90 percent of our gambling time there. The dealers were friendly and people at the table were fun. This was our first time staying so far up north on the strip and we really liked it. Usually, we stay at Mandalay Bay which is on the southern tip of the strip or at the Aria, which is more centrally located.\\nWe always make it a point to go BLT Burger regardless of where we stay on the strip and we have never been disappointed. This time was no exception either. Their burgers are awesome and I love their Knight Rider shake.\\n\\nWe tried out Stack for dinner one night and it was not bad at all. The ambiance is good and the food was pretty decent.\\n\\nOh, and the best part, Mlife comped off our entire stay when we checked out (except for my wife's spa bill), which was very nice of them. Probably their way of compensating us for all our gambling losses for the trip! :)\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Much to our dismay, the menu selection of beers wasn't what was available on tap - rather disappointing when you are trying to make a meal choice.\\n\\n Service on our night was terribly slow, there was plenty of staff  available who only seemed interested in socializing and milling about in a large brood at the back of the Bistro.

It's far for me, I don't go often, but I'm giving this a somewhat mixed review with a downward turn.\\nBeer selection is decent, but I hate the chalice glasses for the higher alcohol beers. Just give me a snifter. I guess they break too often, too many rookies,so they go with the dollar store chalice for durability. Yes I've seen them at Dollar Tree.\\nI'm mainly addressing the food.\\nI ordered the fish n chips. I knew it wasn't gonna be British style, but I still have my complaints - the fish was 3 small pieces rather than 2 large ones, and the batter was RUBBERY!! I could literally stretch the fish pieces apart. I hated that! So annoying! I think my fish was pre-cooked and then microwaved, that's why the batter was rubbery. GRRRRRRR!!! I STRONGLY SUSPECT THIS!!! I hope whoever reads this who works there, that they feel royally BUSTED! You make me ANGRY AS F*&%!!! Learn how to do crispy fish the British way!\\nAlso not much fish volume. Again, I was expecting two decently sized fish pieces. The fries were good, no complaints there. I sampled my friend's sweet potato fries from his pork sandwich, they were good too, good texture. \\nI glanced at my friend's BBQ pork sandwich, it had bacon on it, and came with BBQ sauce on the side. I tasted the sauce. Spicy and delicious! ZING! My friend pulled off some bacon from the sandwich. Not like him to do that, he's a bacon FREAK like I am. I look closer. The bacon wasn't cooked all the way, it was rubbery and fatty. COME ON!!\\nMy other friend ordered a gyro and fries. The meat was barely represented. CHINSE!\\nOne amazing thing I will note however, was that even though the place was full (not packed), the food came out LIGHTNING FAST. Maybe too fast, not enough time to cook the bacon all the way or do decent fish.\\nThe good service keeps you from getting ONE star.\\n\\nI should've eaten at Angels Trumpet instead.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

It's because I know why they exist and appreciate why they are there, whether it is for ambiance, for flavor, or for a quick bite.\\n\\nFor an airport bar, I expect quick service, food for the masses, and an up charge cause well they can.

Though it was a weekday morning, it is Vegas and much like the city, the airport never sleeps... as proven by the masses of people all over the gates and the dozen or so already in this joint.\\n\\nIt's a seat yourself sort of place, which is kind of nice... they should put all hands into attending to the customers. I grabbed a spot next to few other groups who seemed to be pretty well settled in (with drinks, etc.) And that was where I sat for 15 min with no other interaction.... and the waitress must have buzzed right by me 3x without so much as an acknowledgement that I was even there.\\n\\nI finally got my drink order in for a bloody mary, which the waitress convinced me to go with their house version which included a chipotle spiced vodka and came with a double shot... or so she told me... after the 20 min it took to get my drink, it wasn't anything particular to rave about... and it surely wasn't a double shot either... I know what a double shot of vodka in the AM does to me... and if I left there upset... it didn't do it.\\n\\nI placed an order of the chorizo nachos, which were ok... somewhat warm... cheese not as melty as I would expect... but then at this point... what did I really...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I generally enjoy Food Fight restuarants because the service is usually very good (they tend to hire people who are passionate about good service (always friendly, usually make sure a water glass is filled, they have a smile, and regularly checking on you and your needs)). And that is the case at Food Fight. Even when the bar is a couple people deep with folks, the bartenders get frustrated (I know I used to tend bar) but the never show it. They are always patient and friendly.\\n\\nI have eaten here at least a dozen times. Craftsman has some great sandwiches. I love the Cuban and the Brisket sandwiches. The Cuban is heaping mounds of pulled pork and ham atop crunchy pickles, with swiss, whole grain mustard that has a nice tang to it, and a perfectly grilled focacia. The Pulled Brisket is similar. Lots of good, locally sourced brisket with cheddar, garlic and caramelized onions, and again that perfectly grilled focacia. My kids love this sandwich. Add in a few distinct touches like beet salad (yummy!), fried walleye cheeks and german pretzels, plus some standards like out-of-this world cheese curds, burgers, meatloaf and tasty sweet potato fries and you have the makings of a good local  eatery.\\n\\nSO while the food is good, the beer selection is spectacular. 18 Beers on tap from all over, many local, including New Belgium, Bells, Oso, Central Waters, Ale Asylum, New Glarus, just to name a few. many more available in bottles.\\n\\nGreat party room upstairs. We have been going here for our FFL draft every year since it opened and I have attended graduation parties and other events there. Plus they have a balcony that looks out onto the neighborhood.

Homemade chips were great too.\\n\\nThe basic paradise CHZ is a very balanced burger - the brioche bun is perfectly toasted and I love the unusual options of havarti or smoked mozz in addition to cheddar.  They do the fixings a little differently too - pickled onions and cucumber are a fresh idea, and a nice change.  My only complaint was I ordered without either sauce - jalapeno ranch, or the 1000 island that I was given.  I dealt with it instead of asking them to remake the burger, but mentioned it when they circled round to find out how it was.

The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.\\n\\nWe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.\\n\\nWe started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nOur meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.\\n\\nMy guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!\\n\\nMy favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service.

The first was for late night drinks with a group of friends. Long picnic tables on the back patio easily accommodated our group of eight. I'm a fan of eating (and drinking) outside, so we were all about the patio. They also offer a couple of tables out on the sidewalk (probably some good people-watching here... Ellsworth on a weekend night can be entertaining) and the main seating area inside of the restaurant is great as well. It's fairly dark and something about it just makes the place feel upscale and refined. \\n\\nAs for drinks, we ordered a variety of featured cocktails from the menu and everyone enjoyed them. I started with a Rock and Rye, which is one of their happy hour specials during the week (rye whiskey, lemon, orange, pineapple, rosemary, and rock candy). I followed that up with a classic Manhattan. Both were excellent and the service was quick.\\n\\nOn my most recent trip I ordered fish tacos (apps are 1/2 off during happy hour). I was fairly disappointed in these. There just wasn't anything special about them and to me they were bland. Salsa or anything with a little bit of a kick would have gone a long way  to help these. My friends ordered a variety of other apps and everything else seemed fine. Apparently their mac and cheese is amazing, so maybe next time I'll go that route.\\n\\nOverall it's a nice place to get drinks with friends.

One they stripped the threads on something requiring a trip a to an ACTUAL car repair shop (where we should have gone in the first place), the other they simply didn't put the oil cap back on and I realized it after about 20 miles of freeway driving when the engine gave me trouble, smelt like burnt oil and when I opened up the hood it was EVERYWHERE. They told me they reviewed the tape and their oil change guy (I hesitate to use the word mechanic) did nothing wrong. I was also told the manager would call me after talking to an assistant manager, however, this never happened. This bugs me more than anything else, even the damage to the vehicles. I don't know if it was a mistake on the assistant managers part or if the stores general manager just didn't want to talk to me, but it is absolutely inexcusable from any angle with a company that (usually) has as good of customer service as Walmart does.\\n\\nAlso, many things are consistently not stocked if you go in the evening. I know they only stock overnight, but I don't understand how they can so consistently not realize that certain items simply need more stock on the shelves. \\n\\nEmployees often smoke immediately outside the front doors close to closing time so  you can't avoid the smoke.\\n\\nDefinitely the second worst Wal-Mart I have ever patronized. \\n\\nOn the bright side, the frustration with this location has made me realize how much better, cleaner and competitively priced the Safeway down the street is!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

We were at this mall in Tempe attending a disappointing Road Runner Sports event and found ourselves starving and smelling something delicious in the air. We walked up and down the mall looking for someplace that could accommodate the newly vegan husband and somewhat picky kids. Sushi looked good but not for kids. California Pizza too many carbs. Mexican joint to busy and bar like. Cadillac Ranch no, been there before. Some Chinese place no beer, it is Friday night damn it. Smash Burger? Little one and vegan nixed that.

Not only did they have cheaper CDs, but they actually had vinyl albums, something we rarely see outside of a garage sale. \\n\\nThe selection is decently organized alphabetically. Thankfully they have the new and used music separated and clearly labeled so you know exactly which section to search through. I tackled the used CDs while the miss' went after the albums and I was impressed with the prices of the used stuff. The CDs seem to go for an average of $4-5 and my wife picked up three vinyls for $5 each. The vinyls were all in great condition, scratch-free and played beautifully when we popped them in the record player at home.\\n\\nThe only reason I give Lunchbox four stars is due to the parking situation. There are no parking spaces in front and apparently the lots on the side of the building are vigilantly guarded by the other stores who will report squatters. We ended up parking across the street in the huge Family Dollar lot and then ran across Central Avenue. Not the most ideal situation, but totally worth it if you want to spend some time perusing for some cheap tunes.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I called the front desk to complain that I specifically asked for a non smoking room and there was an obvious smoke odor. She told me no problem will send someone to spray room to purify smell. That took 1 1/2 hours for someone to do that who was spraying for 5 seconds then leaves. It did help but we could still smell faint odors of smoke. At this point I didn't want them to come back to use an air purifier if the sprays didn't help.

Next morning,  left the room at 10 am, went out for the day, come back @4pm so we could get some rest then get ready to go to the top of the world restaurant and celebrate our anniversary.  We notice the need service sign we put on the door when we left was still there. We walk in and no one has come to clean our room! Very upset at this point.  I call and complain again...seriously  we were gone 6 hours and our room wasn't even cleaned? ???? I feel that is more than enough time for some one to clean up our room. I told them..forget it! Just bring me towels and toiletries...and someone actually came by in 10 minutes. What upsets me the most is that no one showed any care or concern. .they were just so matter of fact. No one said Sorry!!! I ended up canceling our reservation at the top of the world restaurant.

I understand the complaints of others that prices are somewhat higher than most.  But in my opinion that's most frequently a trade off of quality (while supporting a definite mom & pop local institution) vs. large-scale mass production.  For me, I almost always choose the quality.  Life is just too short to demand a value menu for the usual dreck that comes with it.\\n\\nHaving done the research on their website and Yelp, I kinda knew what I wanted, and I knew about where to order (cash register) and available items on the condiment bar.  Being by myself with $20 bucks to spend (Living Social -- ah, there's my incentive!), I start with a corn \\\"\"cheez crisp\\\"\", and proceed to order a fish taco, a shrimp tostada, and a beef (carne asada) burro plus a Mexican beer (Bohemia, if you must know!)\\n\\nThe corn cheez crisp is more like a corn quesadilla, but it's made with a good quality white Mexican cheese (Chihuahua? maybe Menonita?)  Tasty, especially when dipped in their \\\"\"hottest\\\"\" red salsa.  2 tortillas folded in half, easily polished off by myself, but better to share as to not take up unnecessary capacity for a tasty, yet mostly superfluous appetizer.\\n\\nThe tostada comes out next, with a very nice mix of frijoles (not whole beans) plus 4-5 shrimp, lettuce, onion, and sour cream drizzle (not a lump).  Very tasty.  The shrimp are griddled medium-rare.  I liked it quite a bit.\\n\\nNext, the fish taco and burro were up (your name is broadcast to let you know it's ready).  The fish taco is clearly up with the best I've ever eaten (including Mr. Taco in Rocky Pt, and yes, decidedly better than Rubio's).  The fish is very fresh, crispy, yet tender, and everything supports it.  Superior!\\n\\nI could stop there, but I really wanted to try the burro while it was fresh.  Man, I'm glad I did.

It was very busy. My husband and I prefer a table and the hostess led us to a booth.  When we requested a table, she stated there were none available. We could see many tables available but were told that section was closed. Really, a closed section during the lunch rush? Not very smart management. We were told to wait. So we sat. After about 15 minutes, the hostess flipped the please wait to be seated sign to seat yourself and left. She said nothing to us about a table. We sat for another 5 minutes when more patrons entered and proceeded to seat themselves. Still nothing about a table for us.  We left and will not be back. It isn't surprising to me that they are losing business and having to cut their hours. I would complain about the service but there wasn't any!.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

The server, however, seemed scatterbrained.  Although menus were delivered, she did not pour us water or offer to take our drink orders before coming by to take our food order.  Her question to us:  \\\"\"Oh, did I not get your drinks?  Did you want any?\\\"\"\\n\\nNo.  Thanks.\\n\\nWe shared an order of Poutine which was serviceable but nothing stellar.  The Poutine is covered with onion gravy which presumably is used with the bangers & mash.  Poutine traditionally uses a rich brown gravy, which this was not.\\n\\nI ordered the kale salad with cranberries, walnuts, parmesan, etc.  BF ordered the fish with slaw.  The fish was in shapes that were too perfect to be fresh.  I immediately thought that the fish must come off the back of a food truck.  We agreed the slaw was nasty.  Neither of us could identify what the seasoning was, but it was pretty awful.\\n\\nThe kale salad, although large and the kale a beautiful green, was undressed.  Thankfully the ingredients were tasty enough that it really did not need dressing, and without having been coated in dressing the leftovers were fresh the next day.\\n\\nWe didn't try any beer but the beer list was impressive.  I cannot comment on the serving temperature, glassware, etc., to tell you if they serve it well.\\n\\nWith so many new restaurants opening all the time in the Madison area, I doubt we will return to the Flying Hound for another meal.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

However, the disappointment I experienced during the first visit surged again during the visit today.\\n\\nBoth times I ordered the 1/4 chicken combo, which comes with two sides.  I don't recall the sides I ordered the first visit, but the ones today (the sweet potato fries and pinto beans) were the saving grace of the visit.  Fries were fresh and crispy (although somewhat less so by the time I got them back  to my office); pinto beans were well-seasoned and savory.\\n\\nBut the chicken, the main reason I went to AJ's?  In contrast to other reviewers' experience, the chicken was terribly dry and not particularly flavorful on both trips.  On my first visit in 2009, I chalked it up to the expected hiccups of a place that had just opened. Two years later, that excuse no longer holds any water.  The 1/4 chicken portion today was from a small bird, and composed of a wing and breast. Perhaps because of the small size, the little meat on the wing was so dry as to be crunchy...and not in a pleasurable way.  The skinny breast was also dry and fibrous.   My side order of aji pollero sauce, while piquant and delicious, could not save the chicken.  \\n\\nPerhaps there's something different about the chicken at lunch (left over from the day before?), but I'm not likely to rush back.  My last complaint about the place...again one that I initially chalked up to just-opened hiccups...is how long it took to get my order. Both times I was the only person there.  Both times it took 15-20 minutes to prepare my order.  Odd.\\n\\nTo avoid ending on a sour note, besides the delicious sides and aji pollero sauce, the other clear positive at AJ's are the employees, who were friendly and welcoming both visits. Makes it that much harder to leave this negative review....\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I asked the hostess if I could take a look first and was surprised at the size and selection.  I definitely had to give it try after that.  For that price, it certainly beat anything I saw in their food court.  No comparison.\\n\\nIt obviously didn't hold a candle to my all-time favorite buffets on the strip at the Wynn and Bellagio, but for the price, it wasn't bad at all.  It wasn't celestial like the two that I just mentioned, but overall, I thought it was pretty good.\\n\\nThe waitperson I had was great and I noticed a nice little menu book of drinks with $2 on the cover.  She confirmed that all alcoholic drinks from that book were only $2.00 each!  I looked through the whole book (quite a selection) and saw that they not only had beer and wine, but also real cocktails for the same price.  The wines listed were Barefoot Cellars so I passed on that (but thought the price to be highly reasonable) and ended up having a Skyy vodka Cosmopolitan and also a Stoli Blue Lemonade.  The portions were generous and there was definitely alcohol in there.  Amazing for the price!\\n\\nDuring the feeding frenzy, I recall the following on my plate...sushi, spaghetti and meatballs, fried chicken, turkey, roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, pizza, carnitas, spring rolls, chicken soup, and lord knows what else that I just can't remember.  And yes, I only took a little of each, but even then...yikes.\\n\\nFar from the strip, so certainly not worth a special trip, but if I'm in the area, I'd definitely do the lunch buffet here again.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Huge.  Over the top.  \\n\\nTo me, the best feature of this buffet is the presentation/delivery.  Most the food comes in separate dishes.  Like, for example, if you want a piece of lasagna, you don't scoop it out of a trough.... there is a little cast iron skillet with an individual serving you grab.\\n\\nWhats that, you want calamari?  There is a cute little fry basket with calamari in it, just for you.\\n\\nSure, there were some items that still were served trough style, but there were a lot of individualized portions of food that really escalated their buffet game.  It ensured you got the food the way it was intended to be served.  For example, if they were serving something with cheese on top..... if served trough style, some cheese loving behemoth could come through and steal all the cheese off the top and take little of the rest... leaving everyone else getting the entree with no cheese on top.  With these little skillets and baskets and bowls for each person, you can ensure you are getting the food it was meant to be served.\\n\\n**So why 5 stars?  Here are my reasons.**\\n--Sushi was not good.  At all.  In fact, none of the asian food I had was very good.\\n--Crab legs were served Cold on Ice... unless you request them to get heated up.  I asked the crab chef if I could have hot legs, and he said he just put some on top (of the ice) so they would be hot..... guess what, they were cold.  and the lines are so long, its not like I could just get right back in there and request hot ones again.

I usually order a margarita and chips and dip, because their food has never seemed too appetizing or authentic to begin with.  After my last visit, I will NEVER return, not even if I am thirsty. \\n\\nI ordered a fish ceviche tostada and was served FROZEN, actually, Frostbit, shredded tilapia on a tortilla shell.  As soon as I saw it, I questioned the waiter on what kind of fish they used for their ceviche as well as how they prepared it.  The waiter did not know, so I waited, and waited for an answer.  After thirty minutes with no response, I inspected it and confirmed the fish was frozen.  I then personally walked the dish to the kitchen and questioned the cooks as to what I was being served.  They confirmed it was frozen fish with lime juice, but that they'd be happy to make me another one. Seriously? They offered a shrimp ceviche, to which I replied \\\"\"Is the shrimp frozen too?\\\"\", sort of jokingly.  They didn't lie and said that too was frozen shrimp with lime juice. But that they could go back and check that the shrimp was defrosted all the way!  \\\"\"NO, Thanks!\\\"\"   \\n\\nThis is definitely not authentic ceviche, which they should disclose, but that is not even what I am complaining about. These were not even chunks of fish, it was the scraps of frozen bits you find at a bottom of a bag of frozen fish.  Why would you serve that to your customers?  If you are out of something on the menu, your customers prefer you tell them you're all out and not being served scraps of frozen bits of fish.  Or maybe it always looks this way.  Is making $8 dollars on the sale worth it?\\n\\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend you DO NOT order ceviche, fish or shrimp, at Casa Don Juan.   I haven't had much else there, like I said before but this is one of those things that is unforgivable when it comes to food.  If I...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I forget the name of my lady (which is probably not helpful lol) but she was a bit older than the other nail techs there. \\n\\nAnyway, treatment was standard for every customer--sit in a massage chair (which super impressed me because it has a butt massage option lol!), usual scrub down and nail shaping. Every nail tech also used gloves, which only added to their super clean atmosphere. Also, it was awesome because everyone really takes their time to give your legs and feet a good rub down. Before they finish up your toes with polish, they put on piping hot towels on your legs and feet. I almost fell asleep--it was so relaxing! \\n\\nI thought the customer service was great, aside from this slightly rude guy at the beginning who gave me some attitude when I asked if they had foam slippers --hence the one star deduction.

They were kind of watery & lukewarm. I get the impression most of the sides at Cracker Barrel are cooked well in advance and just sit around most of the day.

Yes, $37.00 was pushing it..... which was what we paid the last time we came, but I told them they'd get their moneys worth. \\n\\nWe finally get to the front where we pay for out entrance, and the lady said it was \\\"\"$44\\\"\"  automatically im thinking, HOLY CRAP WE WERE JUST HERE and the price was not 44. She said the price changed a few days ago. Well, they should have put up a sign or something, how was I to know that?! the 37.00 was still plastered all over the website! I figured FINE, we already waited 2 hours, we might as well.  I asked for a party of 8, and she said they couldnt do more than 4 per table!! I was in shock! I mean i knew that they were busy, but one of the tings I loved about this buffet when I was there the last time was the big huge round tables they had to accommodate large groups! Right then and there I asked to speak with a supervisor, and even she was rude.  She said, and i quote , \\\"\"Maam, you can clearly see were busy, we cant take big parties on one table.\\\"\" I told her Id be willing to wait, and she told me it was going to be \\\"\"Another 2 hours\\\"\" I was upset, so I just took it and said fine, give us 2 separate tables.\\n\\nSo we get to our table, and get this. they sit us near 4 EMPTY huge tables that seat a part of 8!!!!! I was LIVID. i went up to the front and told them about it and they said that they didnt have a server for the section, even though it was 2 feet away from us! \\n\\nOh, and it gets worse.... so we've already waited 2 hours in line right? Just the line alone to get to the food was ridiculous!!! I waited for 15 in just for crab legs..... when I went to the asian section to get the roasted duck that I wanted, it was COMPLETELY empty, and had to wait for that too.... and a lot of the stuff they used to have when I first went there was GONE.\\n\\nOverall, $44 for a buffet? Bad...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

The Crunchy Special is my favorite. Tempura shrimp, crab mix, cucumber, covered in eel sauce and tempura flakes. I want some now just writing about it. They have regular Asian type food as well for the non-sushi eaters. Which is decent. \\n\\nService there has always been spot on as well. You can watch the sushi chef making rolls behind the counter via a camera and monitor mounted on top of the bar. They have a fine selection of beers and sake.

However they are a necessary evil if you want Internet that isn't garbage that can handle streaming/gaming. The way they handle issues over the phone is worse than Comcast, and for all my east coast brothers/sisters you know what a serious accusation that is. It all started with shitty TV Service. My household went through 4 dvr boxes. 4. That all broke. All of them. 100's of hours of TV. Lost. Every. Single. Time. Their solution? Downgrade from contour. That's their genius solution. So my solution? Upgrade to Dish for TV. PROBLEM SOLVED. However they charged us $200 to disconnect claiming we were on a contract. Nope, disputed that. However to dispute it you have to literally mail a letter to corporate. In the mean time, they cut off my Internet service for pay bills AND THEN DOUBLE CHARGED ME FOR THE INTERNET. WHAT? EXCUSE ME? How does that even make sense? So, an angry phone call and 2 hours on hold, I get the Internet back on because I work from home and to refund the double charged service they have to send a check, via the mail, to a local store. Okay, cool. A week later, let's drive from San tan valley to Gilbert. Once we arrive , turns out the check wasn't mailed. In fact the person helping us via the phone wrote that checks can't be sent to the store, and put a future apology in the notes to us. Thanks Cox cock.

With about 5 minutes of effort , he credited our account for $300. $200 for the bs fee , $50 for the double charge and another $50 just because he was sorry. That's customer service.

He made gates very similar to a photo I chose off the internet, and they were installed very quickly. That's where the positive experience ended. Our front gate is hung crooked. When my husband pointed this out to him, he stated that it's because the wall that it attaches to isn't level. That may be the case, but being as we aren't the experts, I'd prefer to have the expert point that out to us while doing the work, rather than us discover it and feel like something is being hidden from us.\\nThe back gate was obviously not measured for properly, and there is a 5.5\\\"\" gap between the ground and the bottom gate. Our two small dogs can easily squeeze under this gap so now we have some lovely bricks underneath our brand new gate to keep that from happening. To pay a good amount of money for 2 gates that aren't secure now and aren't level is SUCH a waste of money. We asked him to come out to fix at least the back gate, which instead of him remeasuring and making a correct-sized gate meant cutting the frame and moving the gate down (not my idea of making the job right), but he never showed up on the scheduled day. Didn't call either.

The hubby said our order came out in batches. \\n\\nGot home, sure enough some food was cold, some still hot. The chicken fried steak was one of the worst I've ever had. The steak was tasted processed and the sauce on top very gelatinous.  The hash browns were overcooked and freezer burnt.  My sausage and pancakes were pretty good though. The eggs OMG tasted as if it was really really old. I've never experienced anything like it. I wanted to barf after one bite. \\n\\nNow I know you shouldn't expect much from chain restaurants but the food should be at least decent.

However, while we were walking to the booth you could clearly see food on the floor under the table.  No attempt was made to clean the floor.  We ordered Fried Rice which came cold.  The Kung Pao Vegetable plate was OK.  My wife ordered some chicken plate which she said was bland with no flavor.  I don't get it.  Why do restaurant owners forget what they are in business for.

Cozy, unpretentious, caring, and with its heart in the right place-- we were impressed to discover that this vegetarian restaurant has been around for over 50 years! Descending the staircase to walk into the restaurant, you feel like you are tapping into an underground secret realm that feels like a cross between a family home and an inn...The food was really fun and delicious and that flavor was all the more enhanced by the warmth emanating from both the waiters and clientele of locals and visitors alike getting overflowing plates of lovely food. It was a joy watching little old Scottish ladies out to lunch with their friends eating healthy and earth conscious food ;) But our very favorite moment was when we came back for dinner to try their vegan haggis--which is something so sublime I will never forget it! This, coupled with Herderson's live pianist serenading us to Saint-Saens, Ravel, and Bach... make this place one of my most memorable culinary experiences\\n\\nThank you for all you do, we will surely be back again!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I always order the Vito because I love Italian subs. However, if you want the meatier, thicker sub, I would go for the NightClub sub, because it's essentially the same, just with more meat and toppings. I've tried the tuna sub, which is good if you like classic tuna subs. Nothing special, just a good ol' tuna sub sandwich. I wouldn't go in with the expectations of classic Deli subs from New York/Chicago. If you want subs better than Subway though and want it done really quickly, then go here, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and one more thing... the sizes of the subs are all one length - longer than a 6 inch but not quite a foot long. \\nI think the hype is all in the atmosphere. Being in Surprise, AZ which is on top of Sun City, I doubt the loud rock music flies well with some of the clientele. I even heard some of the customers complain that the music is too loud. The manager explained that part of the JJ's chain's personality is the loud rock music. It keeps the atmosphere light and upbeat, along with their funny signs, rules, and sayings. The workers behind the counter even yell out and greet you the second you open the doors to enter the restaurant. This place is just so convenient for what it is. It's easy to get to, plenty of parking, and they even deliver 1 sandwich if that's all you order. Overall, I can say that I really like this place, which explains why that the staff I work with hits this place up at least once a week.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

You still have to pay for fries and other menu items which to me does not mean \\\"\"eat for free\\\"\"  it should be \\\"\"only eat single bypass burgers for free\\\"\"  The burgers are ok.

It is a wonderful family experience and tradition.  It is always exciting to see what new things they add each year.  Last year my husband and teenagers went on the roller coaster about 8 times.  This year my twins are working at the farm learning working skills, customer service and teamwork.  How wonderful that the owners give back to the community in which their farm resides.  It is sad that there are complaints about the cost, this is the only time of year there is an admission fee and entertainment always has a price.  Arizona in October has beautiful weather and adults and children alike can enjoy the walks, food, entertainment and other things to do.  Lots of fun activities for children and adults.

Why are guests paying $200 a night and being checked onto a floor where the water is being shut off? This is truly a first for me. For this incredible inconvenience (which you pay for) you receive a letter thanking you in advance for understanding the difficulties of renovating this hotel. They offer you a 15% discount on a future stay....WHAT!

She used 2 different levels of lightener and 3 or 4 shades of brown so there are no harsh lines at all and it both gradually and noticeably gets lighter going down the strands, which is exactly what I wanted.  So yes, it took a long time, about 4 hours, but I am still getting tons of compliments on my hair! It's almost unfortunate that she did such a great job, because it's April and I still haven't been back because as my hair grows out it looks even better. She also gave me an amazing cut, she took awhile doing it and I was a little nervous that she may have been cutting too much since, but she cut off exactly what we had decided and was just being thorough. In addition, she educated me more about how to bring my hair back to a healthier state, and after following what she said (which was very simple) my hair looks phenomenal, even if I just let it air dry, which it never did before I saw her. I would HIGHLY recommend taking the time to go see Deana, the countless 5 star reviews say it all!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

The science center was great fun but our experience here was not very good.  I first ordered the burger which is usually a safe bet.  My waitress comes back and tells me they are out of burgers.  This was 1pm on Monday after the new year mind you.  Then I say I will have the steak sliders, nope out of those too.  Finally settle on Fish and Chips which were ok.  The fish was fresh but was not seasoned at all.  Chips were bag frozen so not much to expect.  Apparently the kitchen was shut down later due to lack running out of food and the place was actually turning away business.  The service was ok but really had to make up for the lack of the kitchens ability.\\n\\nThis is a bar and should probably stay away from serving food at all.

They also have a hand-tossed option, but that has no place in a \\\"\"New York\\\"\" pizza joint in my opinion.\\n\\nThe meatball appetizer was very good and the pizza was great. Their menu seemed to have plenty of other options as well - like I said, great food, great pizza...just not true \\\"\"New York\\\"\" style.\\n\\nThe reason for only two stars is because their service was awful.  We went on a Sunday night.  They were not busy at all.  In fact, while we were waiting 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us, two waitresses were busy rolling silverware into napkins and chatting.  When we were finally able to get someone to wait on us, it was clear this girl had no idea what \\\"\"New York style pizza\\\"\" even meant.  You'd think if that was the name of your restaurant, you might want to educate your wait staff what, in fact, that meant.  Finally, it took forever to get the check of which she had to be reminded twice.  Remember that they weren't busy.  Had they been, I might be a little more forgiving.\\n\\nIt's a shame that they receive only two stars solely because of poor service.

My first was their white chocolate walnut batard. Oh my YUM! It's crusty on the outside and beautifully moist on the inside. When you take your first bite, you get a nice chew that only artisan breads can provide. But then the flavor profiles start to come together and you get a hint of sweetness from the white chocolate, then the nuttiness of the walnuts.

Some cocktails were offered at a reduced price putting to use the Few products. I ordered a Negroni and my friend got a Gin Mule. Both were expertly prepared and presented.\\n\\nThe waitress was excellent. Very knowledgeable, not overly intrusive and available when needed. We started with the Duck and Turkey Rillette with Crostini and Micro Green Salad ($10). It was absolutely decadent and yummy. One could be put off by the layer of fat atop the rillette but had it been pate there would have been the same fat content but it would have been pureed into the meat. My friend is something of a vegetarian but she loved this opening course.\\n\\nNext we shared The Roasted Mushroom and Citrus Panzella $13) and the Herb Cavatelli with house made ricotta, caramelized onions, parsnips and spicy greens (14).  The servings were medium sized. We were not full but we were more than satisfied. Someone with a larger appetite (and wallet) may want a dish to themselves. Both dishes were perfect. The homemade pasta was toothsome, the ricotta creamy and tangy and the parsnips added a special sweetness in the background. The panzella (bread salad) was equally delicious with the earthy mushrooms being the star.\\n\\nI certainly plan to return and see what other wonderful creations they will present.

We took 5 min to go over any health issues and she asked me if I have any specific areas that needed specific attention. The massage was so soothing with good pressure. She was very professional and never spoke during the session, which is what I like.

I'm not sure why The Haze has been hit with so many mediocre reviews here, because I really think it's one of the coolest and most innovative BBQ places I've ever been to. Pick your choice of meat, then have it prepared Eastern-style or Western-style (accompanied by either rice or Texas toast) - what could be simpler yet more brilliant than that? And the food is excellent - similar to the standards of the other Muramoto restaurants but at a lower price, while still maintaining locally-sourced ingredients.\\n  I suspect that to a lot of people out there, BBQ means dousing a piece of meat in brownish-red glop and throwing it on the grill. Maybe they're just not comfortable with this alternative take. Or maybe it's high expectations, or jealousy at the Muramoto chain's success: I don't know! I probably would've given 4.5 stars instead of 5 if I could, but there is NO WAY this place deserves to average 3 stars!

We had sides of mac and cheese and beans. Now this is no joke, within 3 minutes our food was brought to the table! I was blown away as how in the heck could this be fresh? One taste of the mac and cheese (ICE COLD!!) told me I was in trouble. I asked the waiter for HOT AND FRESH, and about 1 1/2 minutes later I got piping hot (microwaved) mac and cheese. Ok, If it ended there I would just say it was a small bump in the road. I tasted my pulled pork and it was barley piss warm with no smoke flavor and extremely bland. Now I'm pissed and DONE eating. The waiter sees that I'm not eating anything and comes over to see what's up and I tell him I'm not happy. I explain that the food isn't even close to what I've had from this place before. Long story short he brings the owner over. I explain to him I've been in the place 2 other times and the food brought me back this time. I also tell him that the fact that it came out so quick meant to me that it wasn't fresh and it was just sitting in holders. How the heck couldn't it be when I got cold mac and cheese and pulled pork out in less than 3 minutes from ordering? His explanation was the he smokes his meat all day and to come back and see for myself( into the kitchen). I politely refuse, and told him I wasn't satisfied and couldn't eat my meal. I did pay for my ticket before he came over and he stated that he would refund my money. The owner indeed did refund my credit card and did ask that we come back and try them again. What more could I ask for? Like I said, I have had good BBQ here before,but it really only takes that one time. There are so many amazing places to try, I probably wont be back.

I was expecting a good amount of salmon but it was just 1 slice of lox. The meal was still yummy, tomatoes were amazingly seasoned. I had to order a side of bacon because the hash seemed Bare without any meat and that one piece of salmon. My boyfriend had the hangover burger and loved it!

This Wal-mart specifically is super ghetto, people take their small children shopping at 11:00 at night, and the employees are extremely unprofessional.  Case in point: my girlfriend stopped at this Wal-mart the other night to get a few things because this location is very close to my house.  Upon entering the store we realized that we would need a cart.  I circled back to where the carts are usually kept to grab one but there were none to be found.  I noticed that Wal_mart had two \\\"\"greeters\\\"\" at the door not doing anything.  I asked one of the greeters if they had any carts available, and she responded that all the carts were in the parking lot and if I wanted one I should go out in the parking lot and get one. I said \\\"\"Seriously? You don't have any carts for your customers?\\\"\"  She reiterated that I would have to go out to the parking lot and find a cart.   I always assumed that the greeters role (besides putting those little stickers on returns) was to provide customers with a cart.   \\n\\nWal-mart - since when is it the customer's job to collect carts for you?

I arrived on time and checked in, and I let the hostess know that my dining companions were running late but I still wanted let them know that I was there since I had made the reservation ( which by the way was cancelled on opentable after I checked in but that is another story) .  5 mins later another dining companion arrived and we were seated while we waited for others.  (FYI there was a total of 8 of us including my friend's daughter) Kevin our waiter introduced himself and let us know that he along with another waiter would be taking care of us. Score!  We get to fabulous men to take care of us. We were offered the endless mimosas but were SADLY informed that the brunch buffet that was once before offered was no more and that a new menu for brunch was being introduced.  I was so disappointed as that was the main reason why I had picked Tanzy as I had raved about the brunch buffet and how good it was.

My BAD.\\nThey were normal, boring banquet rooms, and most of the area in them wasn't even NEW, including the carpet! If that wasn't enough of a joke, the two vendor companies the Plaza referred me to, to help decorate my event, were shockingly unprofessional. \\nOne, called Ltevention, never returned calls or emails over a one month period, and the other, a lady named Maya, scoffed at me as a client because I had 'GASP' a budget! (In this economy, can you IMAGINE?)\\n She expected me to want to shell out over 6000.00 just for floor to ceiling draping to make the room, as she put it, more \\\"\"stylish\\\"\" ....in addition to all the linens, flowers, etc., that I wanted. (Never mind that I thought that since the room would have been a lot more elegant as promised over and OVER by the Plaza, why would draping even be necessary? It is, after all, an OPTION!)\\n Then, to add insult to serious injury, when I told her I wasn't interested in those types of items, just simple flowers, linens and chair covers, her whole attitude and demeanor changed.

So simple, coral with a gold glitter fade. Which ended up being half my nail in gold glitter gel, no gradient, no actual \\\"\"fade\\\"\". Then they charged me $95, five dollars extra for an extra coat of glitter gel polish half way down my nail. I pulled my phone out and showed them what a fade on gel manicure is supposed to look like, she finally agreed to take it off. The owner gave me an attitude and was rude when I asked her how long a 3D flower lasts. She rolled her eyes, half laughed at me, annoyed and said \\\"\"it lasts a long time.\\\"\" in a condescending tone. Mind you, I've never tried 3d ANYTHING before and was excited to try it. I should have left right there. She didn't use the right kind of flower, my toes have Hawaiian flowers and my hands have ugly white roses. Wt.... If I didn't have a Bootcamp class I would have made them do it over or refused to pay $100 for such ugly nails. Which took almost 3 hours!!!! I get angry thinking about it.

That speaks volumes of coolness.\\n\\nThere is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the day it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.

The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.\\n\\nFood was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.

Ok, being a pizza snob it's not Settebello. But sometimes you want a pizza without fuss that you can customize and with a thin crust. And that's what I got, a pizza with a reasonably thin, hand tossed crust. I watched the guy toss it and he's good at it. And when you add fresh veggies and tomatoes and more it's not going to be as dry as a cracker, it's going to be kind of wet. (Notice I said wet, not soggy, there's a vast difference there!)  I ordered a NY Combination, tossed the bell pepper, added green olives and tomatoes. What I got tasted great. The green olives added just the right amount of saltiness so it was like a combination meets a Mediterranean pizza. It was good. But I wasn't the only one liking it as my 2 year old didn't spit it out and he ate very good here. (This is also one place where I even ate the crust as it was really good)\\n\\nMy wife ordered manicottis which I tried and liked but had to stay away from as I had that massive pizza to enjoy.

It came with an eggroll, your choice of soup, choice of white or fried rice, and the entree itself was filling!

I had used Expedia and upon checking in and already being charged for the room they sprung on yet another charge, there resort fees. Funny how that wasnt mentioned from Expedia. We were told that we would be staying in the Manor Lodge. Not in the actual casino but across the street!? Talk about invonvience. Upon entering this building it was so old, run down and outdated along with a \\\"\"musky\\\"\" smell. Being up for over 24 hours prior all I wanted to do was take a hot shower as soon as I arrived. Bad idea. The bathroom had a layer of dust all over the place, the shower handle actually had mold growing inside and to top it all off the hot water pipes inside the wall were hitting against the wall and making a very loud rattiling. Exiting the bathroom and calling the front desk to complain I actually even noticed the lamp shade on the table was tilted off and hanging. \\nWe were moved to the West Tower room with the help of a bellboy which was alot better and what I was used to from my prior visit but my god the smell of smoke is soooo bad! \\nThe casino is very old and needs a huge make over. Enough with the small shops selling fake jewlert and colognes. The breakfast buffet is not bad but for $16 thats a big breakfast. Eat as much as you can to last till dinner time. \\nAnd be prepared for kid kids and more kids not paying any attention and running everywhere. One kid even runs into me and spills his soad on the floor and says nothing. \\nNext time will pay a bit more and stay at a better place than this.

My sister had the Caesar Salad, crisp and appropriately dressed. Nice little salad but nothing to brag about. We split the Crab Bruschetta - six small pieces of toasted Italian bread with a modest amount of jumbo lump crabmeat on each. The crab was tossed in olive oil, tarragon vinegar, and cracked black pepper. Not what I was expecting...very light and tasty. \\n\\nFor my main course I had the Filet. It was cooked correctly, seasoned sufficiently, and very tender. The beef is not grass fed, but it is from PA and fresh. My sister had the New Zealand Lamb Chops. They were cooked beautifully and nicely seasoned. Both orders came with a Baked Potato (with an obscene amount of butter and sour cream on the side), and a pedestrian vegetable medley. The proteins were defiantly the stars here. \\n\\nFor dessert I had a decent Tiramisu. Sis had a cold Godiva souffl\\u00e9, which was REALLY good. If your a choco-holic you must try! Extensive wine list with Italian, French and domestic options, ranging from reasonable to very expensive. Two glasses of Chianti ran us $14.50.

So, I found the neared change machine to get the gaming started. Sadly, all the games are at least 50 cents, and half of the games I tried to play, just took my money. When I asked the bar tender how to get my money back, he simply said, \\\"\"We're working on it and don't play that game anymore.\\\"\" Thanks buddy.\\n\\nAfter that, we finished our drinks and headed to the next spot. \\n\\nOn a side note. If you want table service, you get a PS3/XBOX to play the whole night. At least you'll get to play a game.

I got an appointment to see the doctor to try to get it filled, get told that they had sent it in and that pharmacy had made a mistake, told me they would resend it to make sure, never sent it, had to wait for 4 days over a long weekend to get a nurse to call me back to try to get it authorized.

Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. \\\"\"Oh it is the best soul food\\\"\", \\\"\"They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere..\\\"\" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize?

After reading all the lovely reviews I was so excited to take my husband and child to a place near our new digs, to prove that we hadn't moved far away from good food experiences. We knew that the outside was a strip mall locale, we don't care. We knew the inside was going to look like it did, we don't care. We go to places because of food, service and price. \\n\\nWhen we went they were working on the one entrance so we entered on the far side. There were two people eating and a few children running about playing. My first thought was great, this is a friendly, family place and light crowd would mean attentive service. We didn't know if we should seat ourselves, so we walked to the silverware table where we saw menu's and stood for a moment.  Three times servers walked right past us and ignored our presence. Other workers were in the kitchen area, but no one noticed us. \\n\\nI whispered, \\\"\"Maybe we should get menus and just sit down?\\\"\" So we took three menu's and as I turned around one of the servers came up and made motion for us to sit right there at this huge circle table.  A very large table, but we slid into the corner and he took drink orders from us then dissappeared.\\n\\nWe sat. We sat some more. He walked by twice carrying water. Another server walked by twice, once with food, once with dishes. They greeted two more tables and brought them menus and took their orders. A server came and poured three water glasses for our table and I interrupted him asking about our drink order. He said something I didn't understand and turned away.  We sat. \\n\\nFinally I said, \\\"\"Excuse me, please...\\\"\" I got the attention of a different server and we asked about our drink order which he took again and we didn't want to wait any longer and gave our food order as well. Just in case they'd never come back. I told the server we were new to this cuisine and would need some help. My husband just wanted to leave.

On the weekends there is a special brunch buffet but that doesn't start until 10am.  The buffet was way more than what I'm used to at a hotel breakfast.  There were made-to-order omelets, two potato dishes, three meats, lots of fresh fruit, cereal, coffee, juices, donuts, pastries (I was really tempted to try the chocolate croissant but didn't), biscuits-and-gravy, chicken fried steak, grits, oatmeal, waffles, and probably other American breakfast items I didn't notice.  In addition, there were a few Asian items, including rice, congee (two types - with or without thousand-year-egg), and kimchi.\\n\\nI had fruit, tator tots, coffee, a donut, a piece of ham, and a bowl of congee (with scallions and cilantro).

Even though it has only 1 michelin star, the food quality is pretty much the same as the 3-michelin one next door, except with a more relaxed atmosphere (and 1/3 of the price).  Had the chef tasting menu (discovery menu) and each and every dish was amazingly delicious....not to mention beautifully prepared.  Favorites of the menu were the poached oysters & the caramel panna cotta w/ yogurt foam (probably one of the best desserts I've eaten in my entire life).  I love the dessert so much, I would order it every time I came to Vegas if it were on a set menu.  (It's THAT good...)  \\n\\nWas celebrating a bday the night we came, and in addition to the desserts that were already on the tasting menu, we received an extra plate of mini treats (fruit tart, chocolate hazelnut cake) with \\\"\"happy birthday\\\"\" written on the plate w/ a candle. It was a very nice added bonus.\\n\\nThe tasting menu is the perfect amount of food...you don't leave hungry, but at the same time, you don't leave not being able to walk (compared to the 16 course tasting next door).  The tasting menu takes about 2.5 hours to complete...and since the food is very rich, you become full as it settles.  \\n\\nIf you have the chance, this is a MUST-TRY restaurant in Vegas.  Once you eat here...no meal from any other restaurant in Vegas will compare or come close (except the one next door if you want to pay a lot more $$$ for a more romantic, upscale environment and service).

I heard the wait was long, but seriously 3 hours, NO WAY!. So, we had a couple of bottles of expensive wine, just hanging out in the wine bar area.  After 2 hours we starting after questions about the wait?? Let me mention that even the bartenders were confused on our extremely long wait at this point.  After having visiting the hostess stand a few times, at 3 hours I went to ask, \\\"\"Whats up\\\"\", all because we had notice people who arrived after us being seated, Not good right!  Actually one of the groups that came in after my group was a gentlemen from my work, so when they got seated immediately I ask WHY? I was told that was a personal friend of Chris Bianco's.  Well, it was also a co-worker of mine.  An any account, to seat them (personal friends or not) before my group, who now having been waiting for 3 hours is NOT right, NOT a good business practice.  As I proceeded to inform the hostess of my concerns, Chris Bianco himself came out to inform me that it is his restaurant and he can seat who ever he wants, whenever he wants, and I might mention his voice was inappropriately loud and rude.  Well, being in the hospitality industry for 25 years, I could not help but to express my dissatisfaction, as you might image.  As my group decided to leave, Chris Bianco and 3 of his male employees followed us out of the restaurant, yelling and screaming at us, with foul language.  I was SHOCKED! In my life I have never had such a HORRIBLE experience!  We did not pay for the wine, and I might add that the bar tenders never presented us with a bill, probably because they knew better.  2 of the 4 adults in my part work in the Hotel/Resort industry, over 35 years combined.

Before my initial thoughts, here's the back story.\\n\\nAfter speaking with the owner Mike and the nice server Celeste, I found out that this place is an actual truck stop/wash. They decided to start serving breakfast and lunch because of all the numerous truckers coming in complaining about eating fast food at the McDonald's on the corner.\\n\\nSo SNS Diner (SNS stands for Southern Nevada Services) was born. They have been open for about a year. They are located off of Colton but the main cross street is Losee Road. As soon as you turn on to Colton, the place is on your right. Just look for the barbeque signs. At first look you might think that this place could be where they would film a CSI episode. But after coming out of your car, the smell of would smoke (hickory maybe? I should of asked) should tell you that there is some good smoking going on and im not talking about weed.\\n\\nNow for main reasons why you should go here: The good food and great service.\\n\\nFor breakfast I have had the Biscuits and Gravy ($6.99), Pastrami Hash ($8.99), Eggs Benedict ($8.99), and 2 Eggs over easy with Bacon and Potatoes (6.99).\\n\\nThe Biscuits and Gravy came highly recommended so that was the first item my wife was looking forward to. The gravy itself has breakfast sausage mixed in it and had a little bit of a kick to it. After taking one bite you will know that the biscuits were made fresh from scratch.\\n\\nThe Pastrami Hash was just a tad bit salty but with a bit of ketchup or barbeque sauce it rounds out the flavor. I can only assume the bit of saltiness is from the chopped up bits of pastrami. With that it is comprised of green peppers, onions, scrambled eggs, and black pepper. It it topped off with 2 fried eggs cooked to your liking.\\n\\nThe Eggs Benedict were decent. They were definitely better than the ones I had a couple weeks ago at another breakfast joint.\\n\\nThe 2 eggs and bacon with home fries were just average.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

We were seated outside after a 10 minute wait or so, which is typical at popping restaurant during lunchtime.  But things soon went downhill from there . . . \\n\\nAfter taking our orders, my yellow curry took approximately 35-40 minutes to come out.  I had to ask for utensils twice once my food came out.  At the 45-50 minute point, my co-worker and I decided that we couldn't stay to eat and would need to take our food to go.  So we asked that her food (which hadn't come out yet) be placed in a container and asked for a container for my food.                \\n\\nThe waiter brought me a small, wire handle take out box.  Mind you, my bowl of yellow curry was pretty big and I hadn't eaten much of it.  I pointed this out to him and asked if I could get a bigger container, like my co-worker's, i.e., the round 7\\\"\" take out container.\\n\\nThe waiter took my food and the small take out box to the kitchen; BUT instead of packing my food into a bigger container like I asked, he came back with my food packed into the one, small take out box!!!  There's no way that my big bowl of curry fit into that small container, which means I paid for food that I did not eat or take with me.\\n\\nBy this point, we were really hungry and so ready to go.  I gave the waiter my card to pay, only to have him come back and say that their machine was down.  We waited approximately another 10 minutes, before he came back and said the machine was indefinitely down.  He then suggested we go to an ATM down the street and take out cash, or that we could speak with the manager to make \\\"\"arrangements.\\\"\"  WHAT?!?!?!?!\\n\\nI'm not sure if the other waiter was out sick that day or what happened.

But if you take my word for it and go with expectations of the unbelievable, you may be disappointed.  And you may resent the substantial amount of dough you plunked down for tickets.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you go without SPECIFIC expectations and just let the experience wash over you, not trying to follow the story line -- which doesn't exist in any case -- you most likely will leave with a grin on your face, a smile in your heart, and a five star review forming in your head.  It's happened to me four times over the years.\\n\\nHere are a few hints --\\n\\nTHE DOS:\\n1.  The best seats are around the tenth to fifteen rows (row one is indeed \\\"\"A\\\"\" here), and not towards the sides.  The main theater consists of sections 101 - 105, with 103 being the center.  102 and 104 are also fine.  Order way ahead - O often sells out.\\n2.  I like the 10:00 time better because this is a stream-of-conciousness type of show and a couple of drinks (just a couple) frees the mind.  You can buy them just outside the theater and carry them in if you want.\\n3.  Experience the theater itself - it is a wonder.  \\\"\"O\\\"\" could not be performed effectively without this super-venue.\\n\\nTHE DON'TS:\\n1.  Don't worry about the two clown routines, which are somewhat sophomoric.  They are needed to provide rest for the cast and a chance to change scenes.  You'll see why the rest is needed.\\n2.  Don't focus entirely on the main performers.  Each scene has a focal point, but there will also be other things happening all over the stage.  These are an important part of the whole, so let your eyes take in the entire flow of the action.\\n3.  Don't try to understand the lyrics -- consider it an sort of extra-galactic opera.\\n\\nBy the way, \\\"\"O\\\"\" is a Cirque de Soliel show, of which there are five or six running in Las Vegas.  There is a simple way of determining which are the best: the shorter the name, the better the show.  \\\"\"O\\\"\"...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

This included three scallops (medium-large, but not enormous).  The sauce really added nothing to them.  Not a bad dish, but really kind of bland and boring.  My wife thought that they were tasty but overpowered by salt.  I thought that they were just boring.\\n\\nI had the pappardelle ($19).  To be honest, it kind of sucked.  The proportions were off (oddly enough, not enough pasta and too much sauce) and the sausage that they were using seemed to be high-quality, but ill suited for the dish.  It was bland when it needed to be robust.  It came with what seemed to be  a huge ball of ricotta, but it seemed to just melt in and away quickly, adding very little to the dish.  On the whole, this dish  really could have used some more flavor, if even just some more salt.  \\n\\nSo, in sum, an utterly mediocre and forgettable meal for far too much money (total with three drinks and tip was just under $100).\\n\\nI highly doubt we'll be back.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

J&J IS authentic szechuan, but it's just not good szechuan.\\n\\nWe ordered 4 different dishes; the boiled lamb in hot pot, the pork intestines with hot peppers,  the pork blood and bean sprouts in hot pot, and a cold dish of beef and tripe.\\n\\nThe boiled lamb and the cold dish were the best dishes; both were decently done, but not spectacular. The flavor was okay, the quality of the lamb and beef were good, and the portion was right.  It's what you would expect of a quality szechuan place.\\n\\nThe pork intestines with hot peppers was a bad dish.  The intestines were properly cooked, but there was ZERO flavor with the dish.  It was as if the intestines were just deep fried and then thrown on top of hot peppers and not even stir fried with the rest of the ingredients.\\n\\nThe pork blood and bean sprouts in hot pot was just all over the place.  The flavro was fine, but the pork blood was not good.  It was low quality and overcooked.  Then also within the dish were slices of bologna.  BOLOGNA.  YES.  WTF?!?!  Why on earth would anyone put bologna in this dish as a filler?  I have no clue.........plus it wasn't mentioned on the menu.\\n\\nAll in all, this place actually isn't terrible, but it's definitely not what I would call good. The service is actually good, and our waitress was quite accommodating.  However, for szechuan food I really don't care about the service and decor as much as I do about the food.  Really it should be 2.5 stars, but I can't give it a 3.  \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and go to Yunnan Garden, a place that's much better.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Due to my budget restrictions (insuring a family of four, with 2 adults over 50) I basically had two choices, and each was with Health Net. After two months, I can say they have been generally incompetent, and I haven't even filed a claim yet. Their website regularly fails to allow me to make a payment. They don't send me bills by US mail or email, although I've selected both methods. Their Accounting department doesn't acknowledge payments I've made 40 days ago. I do have membership cards, but how can you trust a company that doesn't even have the ability to be competent at the basic stuff like billing and accounting. How could healthcare.gov use a supplier that isn't prepared to take on a large number of clients? After April their customer service hours have been reduced, which is another sign of incompetence. \\nI wish I could go elsewhere, but even if I could afford it, I cannot change medical insurers for 12 months, as I understand it.

When I entered the restaurant I was not greeted and to be frankly honest didn't know whether I needed to sit down at a table to have someone take my order or if I needed to go to the front counter to place my order. When I finally did figure out that I needed to go to the counter to place my order I sat down and waited for my food to arrive. The food arrived in less than five minutes and the server brought my food without bringing out eating utensils!

When she did bring the fork and I was finally able to eat my food I realized that the food was luke warm and just plain tasteless ( I ordered the Red Thai Curry Dish) That particular dish was supposed to be spicy and had no taste what so ever.

It was a solid choice. \\nWe got there around 12:30, and I figured we'd end up having to sit in the bar area since the dining room was full-up. But the pint-sized Asian hostess was able to immediately fit us into a booth/seat along the central amber-glowing beer wall. \\nOur waitress, Kristin may have been her name, a proud and tall curly-haired brunette with a slight caramel tint to her pale skin, greeted us forthright with brunch menus, and welcomed us with a sincere smile. In my opinion, The Liberty and Brazwell's Pub on Montford are in stiff competition for maintaining the most attractive wait staffs in Charlotte. As I glanced around the dining room, I struggled to identify which of the tight-black-clad waitresses exceeded the others in form and virtue. I couldn't rank them; they're all just flawless. \\nMy mother, admiring the pallet-wood walls, barrel-keg columns, and frothy-yellow suds inlaid the back-lit wall behind her, turned to me and said, \\\"\"So... this is basically a bar? A pub?\\\"\" \\nI laughed. \\\"\"Yes, um... it's a restaurant. And a bar. All restaurants are bars these days. Charlotte has evolved into a drinking city of late. We have like nine breweries and a hundred new restaurants. It's a foodie town now.\\\"\" \\nI checked out the brunch menu. I didn't even realize The Liberty had brunch. Apparently that's a new ubiquitous Charlotte dining offering as well. I browsed the options under the brunch heading - typical fair: omelettes, shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, etc. But for me, The Liberty is a burger joint. It'd be silly to deviate from what they do best. I was, however, particularly moved by the listing in the bottom left corner of the menu - Bottomless Mimosas for $12.

We were there for over 2 hours ordering foods and pitchers of margaritas and his attitude was so poor to us, that we would take turns for asking for something because he would basically yell at us when we did.  During this time, I saw a few people get up and leave before ordering food as well.  After 2 hours of the mental abuse, we got our bill which was well over 200 dollars, tipped 20 percent, and left.

        "data": "Review:\nI moved into this apartment complex a little over 2 months ago. It is a brand new complex and has many common amenities. It is situated on the border of Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. \\n\\nI am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasons:\\n\\n1) Every unit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off. The fan runs 24/7 and flashes a green light. While some may not find it to be a big disturbance, I personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs. Broadstone Alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue Leed certification. (Leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporations). The manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean air, you can be the judge. \\n\\n2) You can hear noise in hallways vividly. While noise insulation between units appears decent, because there is a slit under unit doors, if you are unfortunate to have neighbors who will speak loudly in the hallways and odd hours, it is audible. \\n \\n3) Apartments monthly rent can be for example $1299 for a studio, $1500+ for a 1bdrm and you must have renter's insurance. (keep in mind the area, this is not NYC)\\n\\n4) If you want to break the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 months rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing. Apply that to the sample apartment rents.  $2600 and $3000+. I was not offered any negation room to break the lease.  \\n\\nIt is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price. At such high prices I would expect the corporation to have enough decency to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of it's occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and require lease breaks.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

In June when my friends treated me here to my birthday, we all commented how lousy the service and food were becoming.  Last night was my last night ever going to this place.  My daughter was in from out of town and requested we go here because I would not have chosen True Food again.  We were seated at a table with food all over the floor underneath and a menu laying there as well.  We waited 10 min and many server walked by us but no one acknowledged us.  I finally got up and went to the receptionist to ask if our table could be cleaned and if we could see a server.  Our server let us know he was eating his dinner....really?  My daughter ordered the tacos vegetarian with tofu, I ordered a salad.  My daughter began with a field green salad for $4.  This salad is only lettuce, like TF dumped out a cup of mixed field green out of a bag.  I had to continually stop other servers for more ice or more ice tea.  When our server would approach the table he was still chewing from eating his dinner.  \\nWhen our entrees were served they did not bring my daughters.  I had to flag down several servers to check on her order.  Our server was nowhere in site since he was enjoying his dinner.  My daughters tacos had only a cabbage mix, no tofu, nothing else.  I wanted to have them redone but we were both so over this place and the quality. \\nThis restaurant use to be trendy and the service spot on but the menu is tired and needs to be revamped, the servers no longer even look hip and trendy.

Even for a AAA Five-Diamond award winner, Mobil Five-Star and Michelin Five-Star hotel, I don't think their \\\"\"basic\\\"\" rooms are worth the average $250/night.  Why break the bank for a room that you barely spend time in and then have nothing to spend the rest of the weekend?  \\n\\nThe \\\"\"basic\\\"\" room at the Wynn is pretty nice, (but not worth $250/night).  There are coral colored walls with huge flower prints framed in the rooms.  They provide little slippers to wear and lush, Egyptian cotton robes for you in the closet.  The bathroom has a spa/tub, shower with sitting area, vanity table and chair and a heated lighted makeup mirror.  There's a hair dryer provided, Q-tips, makeup cotton pads, lotion and shampoo/conditioner.  The soaps are pretty nice, as they're lemongrass scented.  Heyyyy...I think the bath water is chlorinated because no water turns that pretty shade of light blue in the tub.  And you smell kind of chlorine-like and dry when you emerge from the tub.  Hmm.\\n\\nThe bed is not too soft but not too firm.  All of the pillows are down/or down-like.

The people who left mediocre reviews kept my expectations fairly low, but with each new consistently-excellent dish I tried, I went from \\\"\"pleasant surprise\\\"\" all the way up to the sudden shock of realizing this might be my new favorite restaurant.\\n\\nI went on a Thursday, early evening, and it was fairly dead inside- maybe 60% of tables empty. That meant that we got very attentive service, though. The waiter was very eloquent and knowledgeable- really top-class.\\n\\nI was with a party of 4, so I sampled a ton of different foods over the course of the evening. Literally everything- from appetizer to dessert- was made with fresh ingredients, creatively prepared and arranged, and all-around excellent. I don't know if we just happened to hit the restaurant on a good night or what, but I was stunned by the quality.\\n\\nOne particular highlight was the hummus platter. There were three varieties of hummus (black-bean avocado, garlic, and tomato-basil) and all were excellent- some of the best hummus I've ever had. They were served with both little pita triangles as well as with slices of fresh vegetables (cucumber, carrot, raddish, etc).\\n\\nAnother appetizer highlight was the ajvar (pronounced EYE-var), which is a sort of spiced red-pepper puree with feta cheese on top. It was fresh, mild, and delicious with the pita.\\n\\nThe menu was quite small (I understand it changes often, depending on what's in season) but we all picked different entrees, including salmon, pasta, an eggplant dish, etc. I sampled all four at the table, and I would have been happy to have any of them as my meal. I can't stress this enough- everything was very fresh, and the recipes were masterful.\\n\\nI'll have to go back a few times to see if every experience is always this good, but as for right now, I think I may have a new favorite Pittsburgh restaurant.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Fine.  No problem.  What I have to say for the small Hertz location in the Flamingo Hotel is that there wasn't a line and it was easy enough to drop off the car and put the key in the box when no one was there.  Thanks.\\n\\nWe rented online and had the amazing option to have free services to drop off the car with us.  It asked us for our address, too.  Super.  Now, if I misinterpreted what this meant, that is fine, but the problem is that after we completed our purchase, the address for pick-up we had entered wound up not being the one on the receipt.  We called Hertz at the Flamingo and left a voicemail, just to find out what to do.  No call back.  So we called again.  Left a voicemail.  No call back.  We went to pick up the car at the time expected, simply hoping for the best.  When we got there, the Hertz employee gave us our car, no problem.  When we expressed our concern about the lack of a call back and the confusion about picking up the car, we were ignored, and the pick-up-the-car process continued as if nothing was said.  No, \\\"\"Sorry for the inconvenience, we'll look into it.\\\"\"  Just continued on.  I may have even looked around the room for confirmation I was really there.  I felt as though nothing we said during the process was actually heard, questions were not thoroughly answered.  And all of the directions given by the Hertz employee were so confusing that each time I heard one I looked at my girlfriend, she thought for a second, then interpreted.  \\n\\nAnd somehow, a reasonable price for a rental astronomically increased with additional charges for this and that.

Forty minutes after being seated, we finally got our bottle of wine. \\n\\nThe food was average but the portions were so small that our party went to another restaurant and had a second dinner.

It seems that the nickel and dime mentality has settled in here leaving guests wondering what other unforeseen charges or overlooked amenities will be discovered.  I DO NOT recommend staying here. My friend and I have had too many unpleasant surprises in just two days. It is a shame really that a  prominent hotel like this has sunk to cheapness and frankly, some dishonesty thrown in. We are here attending a convention and the convention center itself has been wonderful. It is sparkling clean, with great meeting rooms and halls. Our time at the convention is enjoyable without a doubt. But then.....\\n\\nSomething is incredibly amiss at the hotel. The MGM is undergoing construction and that is part of the problem This is a BIG reason to avoid this place for now. Their website attempts to gloss over this fact. It says that the MGM is getting a \\\"\"grand renovation\\\"\" and then proceeds to tell you to check out what is new. Oh how exciting!  However, it isn't the kind of excitement you want; a letter placed on your bed, informing you to expect construction noise as well as the water supply being shut off on certain days. Why are guests paying $200 a night and being checked onto a floor where the water is being shut off? This is truly a first for me. For this incredible inconvenience (which you pay for) you receive a letter thanking you in advance for understanding the difficulties of renovating this hotel. They offer you a 15% discount on a future stay....WHAT!  After checking in and being encouraged to spend an additional $15 per day to experience the \\\"\"grand renovation' experience, you get your water shut off and construction noise during the day! When I called guest services to ask for my 15% discount today, I was lectured on how unemployment is a problem and I should be glad that the hotel did not close to renovate. Can it get any more bizarre? Is there a Wizard behind a curtain spinning politically correct excuses in this Emerald City? Is this mega-million...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

The owner or the lady who is always at the register is pretty helpful, the other two employees or maybe they are her parents, aren't necessarily unfriendly, but they aren't welcoming either, they kind of just stare you down. They have an ever growing selection of natural products which is cool. I love the feel of the place it a decent size yet still inviting. I'm not a fan of the cats, but they have never messed with me, and for that I'm grateful. The prices are okay, I have found some GREAT books for cheap, and then I've run across some book that were a little too much for a used book.\\n\\nI've only traded books here once and it was okay, you don't get cash for the books you only get store credit, I also had quite a few African American titles she didn't seem to want, which I though was odd, because the selection definitely is small, but maybe they don't have a lot of buyer for then...meh, what can you do.

The interior was festive but collected and calm at the same time. Very tastefully done. \\n\\nWe went there specifically for the tasting menu, which my boyfriend had had before and loved. It was the most impressive meal I've had, not just because of the food but because we were served by a TEAM. There was the bread guy, the busser guy, the wine guy, and the main server. They could not have been more polite, attentive, or friendly. \\n\\nthinking we were jsut getting \\\"\"tastes\\\"\" of wine parings for each dish, we started out with a bottle of white but we sure didn't need it - each pairing was a full glass of the most perfect wine.

They were all probably a bunch of adjectives anyway, we're not wine snobs so we didn't care too much. I had to try real hard not to till up with each dish, knowing there was more to come - 8 dishes in all. God, it was SOOOOO good.

Its sad really considering that the food is so delicious. I went in today and ordered the french toast with non-crispy bacon(i order my bacon like this every time i go in and its never a problem). My food came out with extra crispy bacon. I informed the server and she thought I wanted it crispy (not a problem since we all make mistakes). It became a problem when she came back out 30 seconds later with another plate of crispy bacon informing me that the batch of bacon was  just a crispy batch and that all the bacon there was cooked like that. I thought this was ridiculous that she would bring out more crispy bacon since I clearly was not happy with crispy bacon in the first place. I informed her that i come in all the time and ask for my bacon the same way and it has never been a problem before. I then asked her if they could just cook me some bacon that was not crispy. She said she could ask the cook and that it would take a few minutes. I was ok with waiting as I was not in a rush and knew that it ALWAYS takes FOREVER to get food there. About 2 minutes later a man brings out a plate of RAW bacon thats slightly warm. I was really annoyed by this but instead of sending it back a THIRD i just chalked it up as a lost and realized that these people could care less whether I left there as a satisfied customer or not. It really upsets me because I  am a server and i would think that people who work in the service industry would always do there best to make sure people leave happy. I guess I'll just have to learn how to make that delicious french toast myself as I will not be spending anymore of my hard earned money in this establishment.\\n\\n**Not every experience I've had here has been bad.

For about $14, you get three pieces of salmon nigiri, three tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the house salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing.  The slabs of fish on the nigiri are nicely cut and usually pretty thick, giving the sushi a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish.

All are delicious yet all have differences as well. \\n\\nI would say Midwood Smokehouse if BY FAR the BEST BBQ for quality in Charlotte. In my (humble) opinion, this to me isn't true Carolina BBQ.....when you try the Brisket, it reeks of TEXAS-style BBQ. BUT my friends, THAT is why is so darned good! That Brisket is some of the best I've had outside of Texas, and trust me, when it comes to Beef BBQ, Texas is KING! I'm pretty sure the owners will tell you that they tried to emulate a Texas style for flavor and texture. I've been here 4 times, and each time I always get at least one sampling of the Brisket, and each time it has been outrageously great! Perfect smoke, flavor, and melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I just cannot find that anywhere else here in Charlotte.\\n\\nIF you know of any place here in Charlotte that serves better BBQ Brisket, PLEASE let me know! The closest I've found is Saucemans on West Blvd. They're pretty darned good too, but not as good as Midwood Smokehouse.\\n\\nI've also tried their sausage, pork and chicken, and I thought all of them were pretty good.

We felt tricked, which instantly put a bad taste in our mouth, even before the mediocre entrees did the same.\\n\\nBefore we even ordered our entrees, we felt they were $3-$5 overpriced. For example, $12 for 2 corn tacos, $15 for 3 (though it does come with a side). For carb-watchers, they offer lettuce-wrap as a taco option, which we felt was a smart move, along with traditional corn or flour. I got the corn, my wife got the lettuce wrap.

CSN students are very lucky to have this near campus...\\n\\nThere are tons of provided curry options, a few non-curry options, with lots space to customize as well; it's always great when you can count on a menu and add-ons to satisfy almost any taste and profile. You can do a very traditional curry with just sauce and potato, but you can go all the way up to having spam and/or shrimp gyoza on your curry. The serving sizes are generous for the price, and can be shared if you and your partner are not particularly hungry, but not excessive. The dishes are cohesive, mildly sweet, and satisfying, like Japanese-style curry sauces and dishes should be. The green tea desserts are made with great matcha. Bullet-proof deliciousness there. Definitely trying the chantilly dessert next time.\\n\\nI love the attention to detail the staff has as well, providing extra spoons when they know you'll be sharing, and remembering people from past visits. That extra touch goes a long way - as a result, it seems that Kaba Curry has quite the loyal following, and for good reason!

No spooning your eggs out of a mass vat here or harsh heat lamps. For example; look at the above mini eggs benny!?\\n\\n Each table was given a large glass bottle of Aquahealth water and of course unlimited coffee, juices etc and if you paid a bit extra, unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's or champs!\\n\\nI am a sucker for miniature versions of things..the takeout boxes they put the asian cuisine in were no exception. Also offered: korean bbq, miniature fried chicken drumsticks that come in your own little fryer basket, prosciutto pizza, duck confit ravioli with sage (sweet and savory perfection) beet and arugula salad and so much more.\\n\\nI loved that even though it was morning there were excellent lunch options\\nwhich I sampled without holding back (it was for research!)\\n\\nOther dishes of note: the chicken apple sausage was heavenly, mini croissants, hash, fruit/cheese bar, sausage station in general, asian fusion area and a carving station.\\n\\nI had read that Wicked Spoon previously did not have labels on everything to\\nencourage conversation about the food. That has since changed which made\\nthings pretty convenient.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable - I would return indefinitely and recommend\\nit highly if and when you return to Vegas next!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Since Wednesday is not Fry-day, except last week when Penn Central was giving them away for free, I wasn't about to alter course and give in to her jones for fries.\\n\\nSo, I decided get some take out from Asian 1. We had heard bad things about this place, but had never tried it before. I guess it was my duty to fall on the grenade to definitively put whatever nails in the coffin this place needed in our household.\\n\\nFirst off, this must be a money laundering front for the Chinese mob. There were two people in this place. It looked like the kitchen hadn't been used all day except to prepare lunch for these two. I have rarely seen people going in and out of this place, so it's not like today was an anomaly. I decided to go basic and order General Tso's because, how can you f*** up General Tso's right? It came with an egg roll and my choice of rice. Price was under $6... the ONLY positive.\\n\\nThe egg roll was among, if not the worst I've ever had. And this comment is coming from a man who has eaten Takee Outee egg rolls on Bourbon Street. Those were better. There wasn't enough sweet and sour sauce available to make this tasteless fried cylinder of wonton tasty.\\n\\nThen came the General Tso's. It wasn't even mall food court quality. It was pretty weak. Very little spice...like they sprinkled a bit of cayenne in their sweet and sour sauce. The meat was probably not chicken.. and if it was, it was McNugget quality. The flash frying of whomever provides the pre-cooked breaded chicken for this place pretty much reduced what meat was inside the breading to mere molecules.\\n\\nSeriously, if you are driving down Ardrey Kell and you want Asian, skip Asian 1 and go into Harris Teeter... pick up either frozen PF Changs or Wanchai Ferry. So what if you have to cook it yourself... it's a small price to pay...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I told the waitress to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time I was there they had been cold and I really wanted to enjoy this visit. When I received the burger it looked different, smaller and somehow sadder. I could actually fit this burger into my mouth! That used to be impossible because it was huge and I would have to eat it with a knife and fork. The flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers I could barely taste it and the meat was just bland. I was so sad.\\n\\nSo in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. I guess I will have to find a new fav burger joint.Booooooo!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

They cooked it medium but just barely as they knew he liked it medium rare. The kids meal was a great deal, macaroni and cheese with a side of baked potato. My kids were able to split it so it was perfect! I ordered the Mediterranean chicken flat bread. It was sort of like a pizza with balsamic marinated chicken, olives, onions, and feta. My only criticism is it really needed some mozzarella and just a hint of feta. Instead it had no mozzarella at all and the only cheese on it was feta. TONS of feta. I scraped most of it off and left it on my plate. Don't get me wrong it was still delicious, but with no melt-able cheese to hold everything together it was a little hard to eat and everything kept falling off. And that much feta is just too strong.

So I looked at the reviews again and realized I was being dumb and their menu is in English along with Chinese. So I was excited to try it. The place is nothing special, like others have stated, but it's not unpleasant by any means. After considering the reviews, I decided to get dry beef chow fun. I also ordered hot tea. My friends got pork chow fun (wet), chicken chow mein, and the spare ribs over rice. Holy crap, the spare ribs were delicious! So tender and flavorful and cheap! My food was really good too. The meat was very soft, not chewy like at a lot of Chinese restaurants. It had good flavor and consistency. My tea was good too, they gave me a whole pot for a dollar. Nice! The chow mein was also really good, it had those crispy bird's nest like noodles. Man, those are soooo good. I wish all restaurants offered this. So anyway, I will definitely be back to try more dishes.... I really want to try the wonton soup and the chili dumplings (so cheap... whoa... none of our meals cost more than ten dollars).

Therein lies one of the ongoing problems that sadly hasn't changed since we moved out. It is NOT a hotel and should not have transient people staying there on holiday.

Tony lives in the building and another 50 or so Zappos employees live here as well. In addition, Zappos uses a lot of the units for offices and \\\"\"crash pads\\\"\", where visitors to Zappos and the Downtown Project spend a couple of nights then move on. On my floor alone, there are about 8 residents, the rest of the units are rented out by Zappos. Parking is a joke as there is only 1 space per unit, even for a 2 bedroom unit (where does the other occupant park, you might ask? Wherever you can find an open space downtown). The guest spaces in the garage are taken by tourists and people going out downtown looking for free parking and the many daily Zappos visitors. The music is unbearably loud, even at 4:00am and often rattles the windows. Homeless people use the dog run area as their personal outhouse (gross). If you enjoy living with rude, high 20 year-olds whose rent is being paid by their boss and therefore have no consideration or appreciation for where they live or those around them, then this is the place for you.

It was even more entertaining to watch the very large touristy family next to us who wandered in with 7 kids under the age of 12.  There was nada on the menu for these little ones to eat except a quesadilla I guess.

Fried sweet corn with goat cheese ranch dressing?  Meatballs with gooey melted cheese?  Don't mind if I do.\\n- Generous portion size: I like to eat, as does everyone I was with, and we were stuffed after our meal.  \\n- Price: reasonable, especially considering portion size.  The seafood options are a bit more expensive, but that's to be expected.\\n\\nMinusses\\n- Odd table layout: the front room holds ~10 tables and bar seating, but as you head to the bathroom in the back, there are tables along the hallway and oddly placed near the kitchen pickup window\\n- Menu confusion: Reading the menu, I just want to exclaim \\\"\"what IS this place?\\\"\"  Deviled eggs, nicoise salad, eggplant parmesan, buffalo fried chicken sandwich, and mussels (three ways: traditional, curry/coconut, or beer/bacon) all co-habitate on the menu.  On one hand, that might mean everyone can find something they like.  On the other hand, it's just weird.  What does Fran's want to be when it grows up?  \\n- Food quality & flavors: it's not bad, but it's not amazing either.  The macaroni & cheese side was bland, the lamb ragu was not as good as it had been talked up to be, the chicken milanese was just so-so.  However, the goat cheese was incredible; the goat cheese ranch dressing is a wonderful little cup of surprise (dunk all the way to the bottom, and you'll be rewarded with chunks of soft goat cheese.  You're welcome) and the goat cheese salad that came with the chicken milanese was my favorite of the whole meal.

Still, it was decent appetizers and HH pricing at night, so we were pretty complaisant with our choices.

Pretty darn good. \\n\\nHalfway through our meal we notice that we are the only ones left there and that the staff is busting up the volume (90's rap) and dancing to it.

It just really left a bad taste in my mouth- I can't handle poor attitudes and everyone we dealt with that day had one.

That's really all there is to it. \\n\\nThey keep their bread in giant plastic bags because although it's unappetizing looking, it actually preserves the freshness, as opposed to keeping bread stored in a hot, humid cabinet just above the oven where it will begin to absorb the taste of the bread it's crammed up against (Yeah, I got your fucking number, Subway). \\n\\nThey cut their meat and cheese fresh because that's actually what you're supposed to do, rather than pre-slice it and pre-package it so it can stew in its own juices while it gets shipped out to the nearest chain location (My Ultimately Worthless Factoids-2, Subway-0).\\n\\nThey're subs might be healthy, but probably not. Judging by the large number of heavy-set people (including myself) who frequent Mr. Goodcents, I think it's safe to say that all that meat and cheese probably isn't doing our hearts any favors.

I really enjoyed the garlic tuna nigiri and the cajun albacore nigiri and make it one of my frequent orders that day.

Just because some people don't have patience and/or didn't make an effort to come down earlier does NOT mean that Sushimon deserves a 1-star for not catering to you.  They took the price cut to give the public a nice treat and were simply overwhelmed with the response.  Yet, they turned up the production to 11 and kept the event going as best as they could.

I sent it back............and what came back?  My same chicken breast, which now tasted like a very lemony chicken breast which also had marsala on it.

I spoke with Cherelle, who was super friendly on the phone, and she said my reservation was for 6:15pm. We arrived around 5:30pm and waited and waited and waited! Finally around 6:20pm I asked a man handing out armbands (this is how they categorized you by flight manifest)  if maybe somehow I missed my name being called and his response was \\\"\"well, we're a little busy.\\\"\" Really? OK, I can see that but I have a reservation. He told me I would get called soon. 6:45pm rolls around and I'm ready to leave. I walked up to the woman at the front desk and told her I wanted a refund because I couldn't be waiting around anymore--this was ruining my entire night. We had wanted to see a show after our helicopter ride and hadn't eaten yet, which we assumed we would have plenty of time since Cherelle told me total time there would be an hour. The ride is only 15 minutes for goodness sake! The woman at the desk told me they couldn't refund my money and she checked my reservation--it was at 8pm. At this point I'm boiling mad but trying to keep my cool. I told her I wanted a refund or to be on the next ride out. She assured me that I would be next and that she would give me a free DVD of our flight. OK, at least she offered me something for their royal mistake. However, we weren't called until after 7pm and didn't finish until around 8pm. The actual ride was awesome and if it hadn't been for the fact that my boyfriend was pretty excited about it, I would have just left earlier. We ended up missing the show we wanted to see (this was our last night in town) and just went out to dinner. \\nI think this could be a great thing if they were more organized.

He ordered the cake two days prior to needing it (although this location claims they only need 24 hours notice). He clearly explained to the employee that he needed the cake promptly when they opened at 10am to which she replied that would be no problem. When he went in to pick up the cake at 10:15am, it was not ready. The employees claimed that the top of the cake had not been finished, however we later realized that the cake hadn't even been made at all yet. They informed him they needed an extra 30 minutes to an hour to complete it. Two hours later, we came back to DQ to pick up the cake. It looked absolutely atrocious. It was obvious that the cake was rushed to be made as it was not frozen and the icing work was incredibly sloppy. At this point, my boyfriend was very frustrated and asked for a manager. After much conversation, the manager went to the back of the store to speak with either another manager or the owner of this franchised location. He then begrudgingly offered to take the cake back and refund the money or take $5 off the price. My boyfriend decided to take the $5 off, however looking back, we wished we would have given the cake back and taken the refund. I also found that offer quite strange because I am not sure what they would do with an already decorated cake. Regardless, these cakes are quite expensive and should always be made properly and on time. The owner of this location should be embarrassed they are selling such a poor product.\\n\\nOverall, this was an extremely poor experience and we will never order another cake from this location. If you are looking to order a cake, consider the Windmill location as we ordered one from there previously and it was made perfectly.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I aksed for the lox cream cheese.  Instead of putting the cream cheese on the toasted bagel they filled this 1/4 lb tub container (way too much for a single bagel) with the stuff and then charged me an additional $2.25 for the cream cheese.  Their explanation was lox cream cheese is a specialty item and they have to charge more...  however it seems odd to me that a) cream cheese is included in the price and they would not charge me extra for the regular cream cheese they smear on so why is it they have to charge for a 1/4 tub of specialty cream cheese and b) the difference between $2.25 and $1.50 ( for a 1/4 lb tub of regular cream cheese) is $0.75 cents so why are they just not charging me that difference.  Neither the clerk or the manager had good answers just that was what the charge was...\\n\\nDunno if I will be back as I do feel ripped off.  Its too bad becuase I really liked their bagels.\\n\\nSo be pre-warned!! If you order any specialty cream cheese they wont tell you upfront about the increased charge!!!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I waited in line for about ten minutes for snacks and literally the lines (none of the four) emptied (even though they were waiting on only one party) and I was the next person waiting to be served.  Yet, the issue is that the attendant at the end, instead of taking me next, took a man that had just walked up.  I mentioned to the attendant that we had been waiting about 10 minutes and that it would be nice if he would take us first as we would be late for our movie.  Instead of accommodating us, he turned to the gentleman that had just walked up and said, is it okay if I take them.  The man did not answer.  So the attendant told us 'no'.  I walked back to the center and continued waiting.  If this wasn't bad enough, the two attendants working directly in front of us just walked off without telling us they were going somewhere.  Finally, I had to ask the lady filling the popcorn machine if she would help us.  She did quit what she was doing, washed her hands, and waited on us.  I told her about my frustration.  She could have cared less.  I asked her to talk to the manager - she didn't.  I am one week post-op and my weakness should have been quite obviously to all around.  I felt like this theater hires young kids that don't have any training in customer service. I didn't see anyone that looked older than 18 working.

We waited 45 minutes for our main course and when I spotted the waitress with our dishes I said to my friend that we're finally going to eat. Since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while. Sure enough, those were our plates. My osso bucco was still warm, but she said that her fish was a bit cold. Because we were so famished she didn't say anything. Speaking of my osso bucco, it was bland. There was no seasoning at all. Disappointing. I was really looking forward to the dessert since I love anything sweet. My pudding chomeur consisted of a dry white cake with caramel on top. The cake was so dry that the caramel couldn't even moisten it, which is what it's supposed to do. I've had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie St-Hubert.\\n\\nBecause this was during the Mtl \\u00e0 table festival, I paid a set price of 39$ for my food. At that price, I felt that it was slightly overpriced for what I got. However had I went any other time, the same meal would've cost me 54$?! That's just insane. There are better and cheaper options nearby. \\n\\nAnother thing; there are a couple of reviews that mention the loudness of the music. I have to agree with them. Is it necessary to blast music at 6pm? People are eating and we can barely carry on a conversation. Raise the volume at 10pm, but prior to that keep it low.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

It was a solid choice. \\nWe got there around 12:30, and I figured we'd end up having to sit in the bar area since the dining room was full-up.

As I glanced around the dining room, I struggled to identify which of the tight-black-clad waitresses exceeded the others in form and virtue. I couldn't rank them; they're all just flawless. \\nMy mother, admiring the pallet-wood walls, barrel-keg columns, and frothy-yellow suds inlaid the back-lit wall behind her, turned to me and said, \\\"\"So... this is basically a bar?

I rarely drink beer, but they have a decent selection of it, bottles only though, no tap. \\n\\nMy favorite thing about the bar, besides the friendly (and often hot) staff is the atmosphere.

Careful leaving your bike overnight if you get too drunk though... I've had a wheel, seat and eventually the entire bike stolen. BUT that was 3 incidents and I had left it there overnight many times. Helpful hint: if you're too drunk to ride, call Discount and ask for a minivan cab, they're the same price and they have room for your bike! Some cab drivers will take it in their trunk too, but not all (the Kobalt bartenders won't mind asking the cabbie when they call though). \\n\\nThe atmosphere is great because it has WINDOWS!!! A LOT of them. The exterior walls are all glass, ceiling is high/vaulted and glass too. So there is a very open, atrium feeling. Great place to day drink because you can enjoy the fact that there is daylight and you're not just sitting in some dank, dark, windowless cave.

The menu looked promising and we had moderate expectations given that this was a new hotel of the MGM Mirage group that would likely have some experience with pushing food at buffets - but we were sadly, sadly disappointed.\\n\\nTHE BAD:\\n\\nFirst off, there the buffet line and stations are very utilitarian and remind you of a cafeteria - not a whole lot of good interior design went into designing this space and they wanted to seat us literally a yard away from the the entrance/exit with no barriers between the oncoming traffic. We requested another table and they were kind enough to oblige us.\\n\\nHowever, getting to the food - there were long lines for the \\\"\"seafood\\\"\" section - in which case only shrimp and crab legs were served. Just as we were approaching to serve ourselves - the trays were refilled with literally ROCK HARD FROZEN seafood - inedible, crusty with ice crystals. Even once you let it defrost - it was waterlogged, soggy, mushy and tasteless. \\n\\nThere were two or three carving stations. One with an Indian-style (tandoori?) tri tip or a flatter-style steak where they'd carve you a single small strip and expect you to go on your merry way. The prime rib was cooked beyond well-done. The asian dishes were sub-par as well (wonton soup - the won tons were doughy, undercooked, and the kind with the super thick wrappers that you know no real establishment that caters to the Chinese would serve)\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\n\\nMy highlight of the night was taking the tikka masala sauce (and passing on the dry sinewy chicken that soaking in it) and mixing it into bowls of basmati rice... mmm so good!!!! This literally saved my meal and stopped me from good-flavor-starvation. But definitely not what I should've paid for. The flank steak was wonderful with the garlicy/oniony topping.

This was our first time eating at Beckett's Table, and we went based on both New Time's reviews as wells as friends' recommendations.  My wife and I shared the chicken meatballs and chopped salad to start.  The meatballs are terrific!  They are moist, well seasoned and the marinara is just flat out awesome.  The chopped salad is, well, boring.  The romain is   cut into ribbons, which makes it difficult to eat.  I'm not one for over-dressing, but I would bet that the there wasn't any dressing on our salad.  My wife ordered the short ribs and I had the cast iron petite chicken.  The short ribs were very well cooked, moist and tender.  However, the only flavor component was salt.  The red wine reduction sauce was overpowering in terms of saltyness.  Overall, there was no depth of flavor.  The chicken on the otherhand, was very well prepared and balanced.  Now for the service, Cort (sp?) was our server.  The only reason we knew that there were specials is because we over heard him tell the table next to us.  After we ate our appetizers, I asked our server what was in the basket on our neighbor's table and his reply was, \\\"\"that's our complementary homemade biscuits and rolls, would you like some?\\\"\". WTF, I guess you have to ask for the super top secret homemade breads!  Overall, he was very cold and gave us the impression that he wanted us gone as soon as possible.  \\n\\nI think Beckett's Table has the making of a great restaurant.  The restaurant has a great feel.  It appears to be very friendly family.  There are definitely other menu items I would like to try.  My only hope is that the other servers are more personable than Cort.

She either couldn't multi-task or didn't care to, but while she told stories to her coworkers, she'd stop working on my nails to talk. \\n\\nShe criticized how horrible my nails looked, hence why I was at a salon to get them done. She said, \\\"\"You wan square, right?\\\"\" I responded by saying no. She filed my nails and then asked if the length and shape were ok (square) and I asked her to make them shorter and with a more rounded shape, not square! She literally laughed and said that was not possible. Dumb-founded by her answer and reaction, I said, \\\"\"Then why ask what I want?\\\"\"\\n\\nWhen I handed her my credit card to pay she told me the credit card machine didn't work. I told her that's all I had. It was suggested I go to an ATM. I was paying with an actual credit card. They attempted to run it and it worked. Was that their sketchy way to convince me to pay in cash? Another customer paid with a card right after me and that card worked as well!\\n\\nWhen I left, I had to say good bye and thank you twice before all the employees stopped talking to each other to say goodbye back.\\n\\nOverall, the manicure was good but the experience will not bring me back again.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

She and my father and been once before with friends, and my Mom had been going on about their Bulldog Margaritas for weeks. \\nWe made the trip out there and when we arrived went straight to the bar. We walked right past the man who would be out server and took a seat. The restaurant was slow, only and handful of people at the bar and it didn't look like there was anyone in the dining room at all. It remained this way through out the night. So I am confused on why our service was so slow. While we waited for our server, my father noticed that another server had to make the gentlemen we almost walked right into aware of our presence. I guess we were hard to see, being at a bar table right near the kitchen and all. Through out the night service continued this way. A little tip, apparently you have to order a beer twice for it to arrive at your table, or at least that was the case for dear old Dad. \\nThe food was better then the service, but just barely. Charging 50cents a tortilla seems odd, but we went for it because we really wanted to try the agave butter. The butter was good, not mind blowing, but good, the tortillas were small. They can't even shell out the chips and salsa, so I'm not surprised that the portions were a tad on the small side, you get that feeling that they are just fighting to keep their doors open by charging you for every thing they can. I had the sante fe shrimp appetizer as an entree, along with a side salad. I enjoyed the shrimp, as well as the rice they were served over. My salad was nice, the cilantro dressing was boring, but I liked that they used Jimica in the salad. Dad ordered the Green Chili Cheese Burger, meh. My Mom and husband both had the enchilada style lasagna. After they each poured about half a bottle of the house made tapitillo on top it was pretty good. The server admitted that he too uses the hot sauce when he orders it, so they know its bland. Maybe they are trying to...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

They charged me a resonable price since I did not purchase the wheels from them.  When I got home I did a quick walk around the car and that's when I noticed one of my wheels had a piece of metal chipped off right at one of the holes for the lug nuts. I know it wasn't there before because they were brand new.  I called Tire Pros back and told them what I found.  They said to bring it back, which I did.  When I got there the manager said he asked the tech about it and he said the damage was already there!  The manager then said there was nothing they could do about it.  =/  Nothing I dislike more than a dishonest business.

The weather was horrible all weekend so we were really looking forward to Brunch on Sunday before our flights left since the weather was finally nice.  There were 4 of us (all women, mid 30s, corp America Professional, dressed nice).  The moment we sat down our server had an attitude.  The restaurant was busy but nothing too terrible.  He made it very clear from the beginning that he didn't work the morning shift so I'm assuming he was called in last minute.  We were there for over 2 hours ordering foods and pitchers of margaritas and his attitude was so poor to us, that we would take turns for asking for something because he would basically yell at us when we did.  During this time, I saw a few people get up and leave before ordering food as well.  After 2 hours of the mental abuse, we got our bill which was well over 200 dollars, tipped 20 percent, and left.  However, I'm still just extremely upset about this.\\n\\nHere's the thing; we all have bad days, I understand that.  But that is no excuse to ruin someone else's day because of it.

The only problem with them that it is way too salty for my taste plus the place was so tiny I felt so claustrophobic.  I am not one for cramped spaces.  \\n\\nMy husband is an especially picky eater, especially with Asian food, but he loves this.  I think he finally found a place that he cannot get sick of.  They offer such a variety of food that you cannot go wrong.  I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  Very cozy and casual.\\n\\nThe staff is on point when it comes to filling our drinks.  That is one of my biggest peeves is when the servers do not fill my drinks on a timely manner, but they do and I love it!  They are seriously on point when it comes to greeting us when we first come in.  \\n\\nMy usual order is the Tonkotsu Asari.  Thank you BTW for not making salty.  I have a sensitive palatte so I am glad that you are able to add flavor without making me an enormous amounts of water.  My husband gets the Tonkotsu Spicy which he makes super hot.  It looks delicious, but I do not do spicy foods.  I think you guys made me a lover for the Takoyaki (Octopus Balls) and the Pork Chashu Bowl.  Yum!  \\n\\nThis is definitely a place that we can eat with our friends and family.  My husband, cousin, and I are going to be regulars here.  People should seriously try this place out.  I cannot rave enough about this place.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

You better read the fine print when reserving a room here because they might not inform you about the $14.95 per night surcharge.  Me and my friends wanted to find a fairly inexpensive hotel and when we booked online on expedia, the rooms were only $42/night.  But when we got there, we were informed of the ridiculous surcharge.  I can understand if it was something like $5.00 or something but $14.95?? If it was still summer time when we can at least use their ugly pool, i can also at least understand that.  I mean, even the GOLD COAST which is much more decent than Palace Station has a surcharge of only $3.00!  Okay, live and learn i guess.

A wonderful selection of breads to take home (among which are their famous giant English muffins), breakfast, sandwiches and salads, delectable desserts at reasonable prices.  Lots of patio seating, and super busy just about any time (weekends most of all), with spotty service.  \\n\\nFOOD: If you're breakfasting here, the commuter is incredible! Try it with salmon and avocado, but be sure to leave room for dessert!  The French pancakes are swell, and so is everything else I've tried, but the commuter is far and away the winner, whether you add any kind of meat or not.  If you're going for healthy, get the mayo on the side.  Red velvet anything is great here, as is the key lime pie.  \\n\\nSHOP: The odds-n-ends shop is my favorite eclectic collection around - I measure other cute shops by their yard stick (e.g. \\\"\"this place is kinda cute in a La Grande Orange kind of way\\\"\" - but no other place quite measures up).  I've bought kitchen supplies, clothing, jewelry, books, dog toys...I could go on.  Everything is at least a little bit interesting!  I highly recommend the Out of Print and Yoganastix clothing brands - I've bought both from here and they've stayed soft and nice with much wear.   \\n\\nSERVICE: To be honest, the service is spotty to poor.  For a while, I had orders mixed up almost as often as correct - with no apologetic attitude, to boot - and I stopped going.  My last few visits have been pretty great (aside from overhearing a woman who had terrible service getting no help at all to make it better).  It's definitely a risk.  It's so popular that the counter employees don't seem concerned with customer service at all (the servers in the main restaurant are great, if you come for a sit-down dinner, but that's a different Yelp listing).\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

If you love uninspired, bland, boring food that helps give chain restaurants their hated reputation you've found the right place. If you like waits due to slow or no service this is your place. If you really want to see someone try and create a faux New Orleans environment and come up woefully short at the feeble attempt, this is your place. About the closest this would come to New Orleans would be Slidell, LA style. Slidell is a small city just North of Lake Pontchartrain and I'll just leave that slam hanging...\\n\\nI would much rather eat late 1970's high school cafeteria food than be forced to choke down what is served here. And if you want a \\\"\"New Orleans\\\"\" experience with your food you're better off finding your closest Popeye's Chicken for something that's Louisiana fast vs. the stuff they bring to your table, which in the case of this Henderson location is usually: A: Cold  B: Not what you ordered C: Overpriced for what you get. Pick 2 of those choices on almost every visit. \\n\\nHow this chain has proliferated is a testament to Sysco's ability to keep bulk food prices down, and for people to tolerate crappy food and even crappier service. \\n\\nIn short, you would be better off scouring Yelp for the absolute worst Las Vegas casino buffet and going there vs. eating here. At least there's Walgreens and CVS's close by for the Pepto and Tagamet you'll need after the fact. And as I'm writing this I realized it's not far from the Mongolian grill that made me sick too. Is there something about the East side of Stephanie, just South of Sunset that is destined to have crappy food? I'm beginning to wonder.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Unfortunately it looked and felt  like it was furnished with used dorm room housewares from Target. The only other person at the bar was the cook. And to top it off there was a techno remix of The Price Is Right Theme song playing on the lone speaker behind the bar.  Needless to say this set our expectations pretty low.\\n\\nWe cautiously approached the bar and ordered the evening specials- $2 tacos and $3 margaritas. The margaritas were pretty syrupy and sugary. I wouldn't order them again. The tacos were ok. We each ordered the same 3 tacos- 1 chicken 1 lamb and 1 pork. They were luke warm which is odd because we were the only people in the restaurant. They were served on the smallest corn tortillas I've ever seen and I've seen my fair share of tacos. The flavor was ok. I guess I'd say the pork taco was the better of the 3.

We have been craving fish tacos, so we ordered the Red Snapper, whole fish,  cooked in garlic.  They have very good quality tortillas I must say. We used the tortillas to make a little burrito with the garlic fish and added the delicious chipotle sauce and habanero hot sauce to give it a good kick. Those were delicious. I must say they could use a reassessment of the salad they serve because they were wilted and just did not look good. The fish was also a bit smaller than I expected considering the price and when compared to Baja Joe's. I also got to try my brother-in-law's shrimp burrito - enchilada style and i must say it was HUGE! Also, they were generous with the perfectly cooked shrimp! My mother-in-law got the carne asada and that was cut pretty thin and wasn't as juicy as I expected, so I don't think I would recommend it. The ambiance of the restaurant is basically as if you walked into Mexico, it compliments the food in my opinion!

Wicked Spoon is far better than those.  \\n\\nFirst off this was our first time to Cosmopolitan.  We drove here from the Rio where we were staying.  It took about ten minutes to get a parking spot and to the restaurant from our hotel which was impressive for Vegas on a Saturday.  We drove in on Harmon which connects on the west side of I15 now, found a parking spot right by the garage elevator and the elevator dumps you out in the casino, the escalators is right there to take you to the buffet.\\n\\nWe stood in line for about 10 minutes before they seated us.  The place is decorated beautifully.  I started with a apple cinnamon muffin and honey yogurt with granola, both were amazing.  I went back for the mac n cheese, butternut squash raviolis and some salad, all of it was awesome.  At the end I made my way to the dessert area.  Everything looked so good.  The gelatos were so flavorful.  I highly recommend the salted peanut flavor.\\n\\nAlthough I'm not a big fan of buffets since I don't get my money out of them being a vegetarian, I do go eat at one on each trip to Vegas.  Wicked Spoon is now my buffet of choice.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I ordered two stoli o and sodas - but my first was significantly weaker than the second even though it was made by the same bartender. It wasn't a huge deal, but  I feel that drinks should at least be consistent. The happy hour party comes with free appetizers as well. They hand everything out to you most likely to conserve food. I felt overall the temperatures were off  but most of what I tried tasted  pretty good. \\n\\nThe real reason for the meh review had to do with a bus person (or manager)- I really am not sure who he was. Basically we had two or three tables pushed together because we had a large group. He kept obsessing about our seating arrangement and trying to push our chairs in. It wouldn't have been a huge deal but there were four chairs to a small table-top and we would have been packed in like sardines if we kept the table the way he clearly wanted it. Even when we said we needed a bit more room he stomped around us and was visibly agitated. We were not creating any kind of distraction and the chairs were not a hazard the way we had them, he was compulsive about them, it was really strange.\\n\\n\\nThe instrumentals were good - and the musicians clearly had a wide-range of song knowledge. The vocals were not nearly as good, in fact I hate to say it but they were just kind of bad. \\n\\nAll in all I don't think id go again, one dollar drink or not...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

The atmosphere is very cool, but unfortunately not much else was redeeming and we would never go back---especially not at those prices. To begin, the service was mediocre at best. We were greeted with nothing more than, \\\"\"Hello, can I get you something to drink?\\\"\" Not, \\\"\"Welcome, how are you this evening, glad you are with us.\\\"\" That's always a turn off, and at a nicer, somewhat expensive restaurant, that is simply unacceptable. Our drink service was prompt, and waters were refilled quickly and consistently. We ordered Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer and it was decent and pretty flavorful but I've had much better elsewhere. My wife ordered scallops wrapped in prosciutto which sounds like a can't miss dish, but honestly, the prosciutto tasted like it had either gone bad or had been cooked very wrong---and I tasted it and almost spit it out. For maybe the second time in our seven year marriage she returned a dish, and justifiably so. The waiter did not even apologize---he just asked if we would like something else. Her replacement dish of Shrimp Scampi was unremarkable, as was my Chicken and Fusilli, and it was at this point that I determined this was just not a very good restaurant, and not worthy of my money ever again. If you can't make pasta taste phenomenal with every ingredient on earth at your beck and call, maybe you should find another chef. Sorry Bobby's, I won't be back and I've already recommended to several people that there money would be better spent elsewhere.

Rather than returning them to the kitchen, the waiter pressured us to relinquish our less than half-eaten salads. We didn't put up too much of a fight as the caesar salad was not particularly enticing.  RIght on the waiter's heels, the sommelier appeared with the nice bottle of chardonnay that we had ordered.  It was completely unchilled. Rather than refusing it as we should have, we allowed him to talk us into pouring a small sip with the promise that he would rapidly chill the remainder.  At that point, the waiter, sommelier, and our bottle of chardonnay disappeared into oblivion while we finished our entrees, sans wine.  Only well after we had finished picking at our entrees did the waiter reappear. We had to ask him to please fetch our wine, which he did unapologetically. As you can probably guess, the wine was still completely warm.  He proceeded to pour a glass for each of us and then started to leave with the bottle in hand.  At this point, my wife nearly jumped up to tackle him, fearing that if he escaped with the bottle we would never see him or our warm wine again.

I told her to take away this order and bring me an appetizer of bang bang shrimp, which was good, that I had for my dinner.  There is absolutely NO value for your money at this restaurant and I was so surprised that people in this town like to pay for so little food at such a HUGE price.

My fiance repeated his reason for not giving it to her, to which she replied with a roll of the eyes and a \\\"\"Well, it's a 45 minute wait.\\\"\" I think she misunderstood the favor that we were doing her by not having to go through the trouble of spelling, and pronouncing our last name; which she would have butchered if left to her. \\n\\nAfter that, we went to the bar. I am not a fan at sitting at the bar, but the bartenders were very animated and friendly. They served us our drinks and food quickly. The bartenders were also very helpful on helping us make selections. We ordered (I don't remember the exact names) the pub sliders, pretzel sticks, and the fish and chips. Me and my fiance share food a lot, and it is a wise idea to do that here,because the portions are large. \\n\\nI thought that the food was presented beautifully, and that it tasted good. The pub sliders were juicy and came with a side of garlic mayo, loved it. The pretzel sticks came with a side of spicy mustard (VERY SPICY AND AWESOME), and the fish and chips were tasty and not too greasy. \\n\\nWhile we were eating at the bar and enjoying ourselves, we noticed the beauty queen hostesses up front flipping their hair and snapping their gum. We also noticed a ton of empty tables in the establishment. Clearly, doing their job is so exasperating for them. Gosh, they should take a break. \\n\\nI would come here again, and I would recommend it to a friend. I took off a star because of the rude introduction we got from the hostesses.

My travel partner works concierge at the spa at Mandarin Oriental's DC location, so she was interested and checking out the facility even though neither of us could spare the cash to splurge on a treatment here.  This review is strictly for the facilities, which I simultaneously found both incredibly impressive and disappointing.  Disappointing only because the spa lacks some of my favorite standard spa amenities like a jacuzzi (they only had a warm \\\"\"vitality pool\\\"\" which was at least 10 degrees cooler than how I would run my bath) and a sauna.  To me, use of the spa facilities are half the draw of visiting a spa even when I do book treatments so the lack of some of my favorite amenities was a bit of a bummer.  That aside, this spa has a lot going for it.  The spa areas were immaculately clean, attractively modern in their design, offered stellar views of the strip, and had a lot of cool techy features like experience showers with touch screen menus and the ability to turn on the jets for the vitality pool on a station/lounger by station/lounger basis rather than for the whole pool.  Their relation room is one of the nicest and most relaxing one I've ever been in, with plenty of beds situated in front of windows overlooking the strip to rest in while waiting for your appointment or just to get some rest.  Finally, I can't say enough good things about their staff.  The service was top notch, friendly and extremely attentive without being obtrusive.  Always there to offer you a towel, a bottle of water or to fetch eye makeup remover for when the experience showers have ruined your eyeliner and you've neglected to bring your own.  Really top notch service.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

With my 22 month old on my lap dancing with her arms to every song, my 7-year old getting a high-5 and my husband getting a fist-bump, I was so happy that we got the best seats in the house.  \\n\\nThe guys were truly entertaining and I couldn't help but feel so proud of a big group of guys who had this ambition since they were very young.  I'm sure having a solid gig on the Vegas strip was probably more than what they could have ever imagined when they started this crew years and years ago (or maybe it was?).  They deserve every success and accolade that they have achieved thus far and I'm betting my hat off that there's still much more than a steady gig in Vegas.  \\n\\nThe performance kept us entertained the whole time.  We laughed constantly (who knew that it would be a comedy show also?) and many of the old-skool songs kept my husband and I happy that they still kept it real for us old-skoolers.  \\n\\nMany of you checking out Yelp reviews before dropping some hard cash and comparing a bunch of b-boyz to say some of the other performances on the strip, I can assure you that you'll leave feeling glad that you took a chance on the Jabbawockeez's performance.  As much as my hubby loved watching the guys on TV, even he had doubts of whether or not he would want to watch a bunch of breakers/poppers for a whole 1.5 hours.  It was more than we expected.  They genuinely exceeded our expectations and we totally felt that we got our money's worth.  We were laughing and dancing.  I felt thrilled the entire time and I can't wait to watch them again.  \\n\\nIf you're a Jabbawockee and you're reading this, KUDOS TO YOU!  I, personally, am very proud of you.  Thanks for keeping it real and putting a bit of b-boy love on the Vegas strip.  Keep on rockin'!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

The building gets way too hot in the summer, the rink is not cleaned enough, and the officiating is horrible. The league fees are also too expensive, if it goes up one more dollar I wouldn't play there anymore. The locker rooms are way too small to fit a team of 8 guys. The leagues are not very popular, with only 4 teams per league. Too many travel players play on the lower leagues, when they stick to the top league. Whenever it rains, the games are canceled because the roof is a sieve.

I got sick from eating the raw oysters. The fish was dry because it has been sitting too long. They don't rotate the fried chicken, so it's the same few pieces sitting there for an hour. The pizza was depressing. and the ice cream wasn't very creamy at all. Plus the veggies were limp.\\n\\nThe marinated rib eye was pretty good. The creme brulee was pretty good, as was the choco chip cookie, but for what I paid, I don't see the value. Very disappointed, because this place was supposed to offer a premium product, being associated with the Wynn name and all. Maybe this was why there was 0 wait time when I got here Friday night at 6pm? And to think at one time, this was one of my fave buffets of all time. Sad...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Since this place appeared on Restaurant Impossible it is good to report that the decor and menu are still just about the same when on the show.

Then everything seems to have gone down the toilet.  When we got inside and attempted to order the pasta bar we were told it wasn't available due to the street festival going on outside.  Hmm, funny, because there is still a sign, if not two, posted outside advertising this.  If you were not going to honor this special (which I believe runs Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) then maybe you should have taken in the signs for that week.\\n\\nWhen we decided we weren't going to dine here and let our waitress know our intentions we got this great, drawn out excuse why we shouldn't go.  Instead of honoring the all you can eat portion of this, they would hand you a card with options on it to fill in for the pasta bar.  Mind you, it wasn't even all you can eat, just whatever you checked on the card (more like a slip of paper) was what you got.  \\n\\nAfter sitting there and made to feel guilty our waitress came back over and gave us the real reason for the guilt trip: Her manager (who just happened to be the hostess as well) would eventually yell at her that night and quite possibly fire her.

As I went there, the friendliness of the people working there, combined with their knowledge was unprecedented to me. It became something  I often said made Vegas so awesome to live in. And then it closed!!! Happily Doug got it open again, and I have to say that it because of this market that I have found so many great restaurants _where you can trust the ingredients_ because you know where they come from and how good they are.

I am from Italy and most italian buildings have cellars which look complitely identical, with the sole exception of salami and wine which here were absent.\\nThey spend some time telling you that people used to spend time there and that they found oyster shells which might indicate that the room was a tavern of some sort, but the whole thing is rather pathetic. 3 minutes would be too much to take a look at what is there to see. \\nThey show many stories underground in boards and posters giving the impression that you actually get to explore a complex system of underground tunnels and rooms, but then you only get to see three rooms and a corridor.\\nObviously we complained and the manager was hiding behind the good reviews. Oh dear, a bunch of hyped-up tourists giving 5 stars to everything they've done is hardly an excuse to rip people off in this way.\\n\\u00a32.50 would be an adequate price, and without the time-filler, I mean the tacky storytelling.\\nStrongly advise you not to go on ANY tour of this kind.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

The presentation was nice, if a little dated, but sadly within just a couple days the flowers died.  Every other time I have received flowers from this company they have not lasted as long as other florists or even the cheap flowers from the supermarket.  I would rate the quality of the arrangements from this florist as 3/5.\\n\\nMost recently, my husband attempted to place a last minute balloon order at 3:30 pm from this company over the phone.  Their website states they are open until 5pm so he thought that may be enough time to pick up the balloons.  He was advised by the person who took his order that the balloons would be ready for pick up the same day.  When he arrived to the shop at 3:50 pm the shop was closed early and the store door hours stated they closed at 4pm.\\n\\nHow did this miscommunication happen?  Well, anyone who is thinking about ordering from this florist should be aware that the phone number they advertise actually goes to an off site call center that represents themselves as in-house.  My husband was lied to that he could get the balloons the same day when the florist closed early that day without informing their call center ordering team.  When my husband called the phone number (that they list on their website and on the door of their shop) as he stood outside the CLOSED shop, the person on the phone still tried to represent themselves as a florist on site and that the store was indeed open.  This was very frustrating and the miscommunication and outright lying wasted his time\\n\\nI understand that sometimes last minute orders cannot be filled but this business needs to update their website with their ACTUAL hours and make sure that whatever ordering service they use is updated with any exceptions to their hours. The call center ordering team that their phone number directs to also needs to be honest about the fact they are not on site.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I couldn't hear the Hostess on the other end and she couldn't hear me because of the ridiculously loud blaring music behind her.  I got the \\\"\"lazy\\\"\" answer of that they were packed to the gills and there was no room for me to push out the time.  Fine, it worked out and we got there 5 minutes prior to 6:00.  When we got there the 3 hostesses were pretty snotty and couldn't be bothered and asked us to wait at the bar which was fine, but I walked past a nearly empty dining room to get the the bar.  I never get the whole overstaffing of hosts / hostesses thing.  Also, these people are the first impression you get when you walk in and to have them not be welcoming and efficient is a bad start to the experience.  \\n\\nAt 6:20 we finally got seated only when I went and bothered the ladies at the hostess stand again, saying we were ready to be seated.  We walked upstairs and we were seated right next to the kitchen (Awesome right?).

The other thing was my friends bought a table & bottle (which was pricy for such a small place, but cheaper than the usual nightclub, but as I've said in reviews before it's vegas so high prices are what you should expect). Anyway, the waitress (who was very nice) asked if she could resell the table, I said to ask our friend who bought it, but she asked some other guy while our friend was in the bathroom & resold our table.  My friend came back & was pissed! We did talk to the manager & he comped us another bottle & table, which was very nice & made the night a little better.

It's at the far end of the strip and while there is a tram (which only runs during certain hours) it's still a distane from all the action. Whether this is good or bad is really up to you and what you expect, however if you are looking to be in the middle of the action this isn't the place to be.\\n\\nTHEhotel is a great property to relax at. Nothing is done quickly by the staff at the hotel (which is good and bad). You never get the feeling of being rushed and you never get the feeling of people rushing for you. The property is beautiful and feels upscale.\\n\\nThe room was nice, however our TV was broken. Because we were just staying a night we did not request to have it fixed (as it was late at night by the time we turned it on) however when we informed the clerk at check-out about it he really didn't seem to care. Hopefully he made a note after he finished checking us out to have it fixed for the next person. Other than the TV issues the room was just as you would expect out of a property of this level. While it is a little older than Encore, Cosmo, etc... it still provides you with a great room.\\n\\nWe had breakfast at TheCafe and while it was good it did not stand out over any of the other hotel restaurants we have ate at for breakfast in Vegas.

I ordered it to go just a few days ago and it looked like a $3 salad. Not even an once of chicken, a few tiny pieces of manchego and ONE date. ONE!!! The container was about 6 inches long and had about an inch tall of salad. Not even appetizer size. With tax, it was over $16. That makes me angry.

What a cute twist on your typical eggs benedict dish! The eggs were perfectly poached on toasty slabs of english muffin and accented with the rich and savory sundried tomato hollandaise. The bits of candied prosciutto added a nice meatiness to the benedict without making it too heavy. And while I don't normally reach for mixed greens for breakfast....

It wasn't terrible, but I've experienced better.\\n\\nCheck-in was easy... the woman at the desk was very friendly and the whole process was pretty painless.  The room she had put me in had a killer view of the strip.  The room was pretty nice... they are all suites, so they are huge.  A TV in the living room, another in the bedroom, and even one in the bathroom... wow!  The bed was incredibly comfortable... generally hotel beds are horrible on my back, but this was one of the most comfortable beds I'd ever slept in.  Also, the room was quiet... I didn't have any noise from my neighbors or hear other doors opening/closing. \\n\\nI'm not much of a gambler, so don't really have any comments there.  It seemed clean and didn't completely stink of cigarette smoke, so that was a nice plus.  \\n\\nMy biggest complaint is that I was promised a non-smoking room... there is no way in hell that my room hadn't been smoked in recently.  It smelled so strong, that I was struggling to breathe the first time I had walked in.  I immediately called the front desk... they said they were going to set up an air purifier in the room and promised this would take care of it.  This was at about 10:15am.  By 11am, they still hadn't shown up yet, so I called back to make sure they were still coming.  I was promised they would be there in the next 20 minutes.  Since I had to go check in at a conference and wouldn't be in the room, I took their word for it and figured it would be dealt with while I was gone.  Unfortunately, I showed up at the room again at about 5:30pm, and it still stunk incredibly bad.  I called back to the front desk again and they apologized and would be sending somebody right up.  So, 10 minutes later, a guy shows up with a spray bottle... now when they said air purifier, I expected some sort of HEPA air filter, or something along those lines... not an industrial bottle of deodorizing spray.

I was going  there to have a small nail in my front tire repaired.  I was also having them replace 1 rear tire and having my alignment done.  Before they did any work I asked how long it would take since I had a 1 PM appointment.  They replied \\\"\"less than an hour\\\"\".

I tell them no, it's too late  I have to go, I ask them to put my car down saying I'll get the alignment done later.  It would have been nice to at least receive a phone call saying it was taking way longer than they stated, but no, I ultimately had to tell them to lower the lift and give me my car back pronto.\\n\\nAt this point I just thought their service was very lack luster.  After my 1 PM appointment I began the drive to southern California (which Tire Works was also aware of).  After about 25 miles into that journey I end up on the side of the road with a flat tire.

The meat in the sandwiches was moist and tender. The buns were fresh. Once you got to the bottom of the coleslaw container it was actually quite good. My roast potatoes were ok (quite bland though) and partner's fries were good. The BBQ dipping sauce was quite nice.\\nThe Bad: The mushroom condiment was so peppery as to be off-putting. The onion condiment was relatively tasteless. All the other condiments were either too vinegary or peppers. Partner had to add quite a bit of Tabasco to the wings even though the hottest sauce was asked for. I asked for \\\"\"a little bit\\\"\" of sauce  but the counter-person slathered my bun with it. The coleslaw is served in pre-prepared plastic cups and, therefore, the top part was dry and flavourless. My roast potatoes really needed the BBQ dipping sauce to taste like much. The only dessert available was individually plastic boxed slices of a \\\"\"lemon pie\\\"\" with no meringue but a factory piped \\\"\"cream\\\"\" top that took me 3 forkfuls before I could taste any lemon flavour.

The rooms have always been clean with all of the cool electronic room controls that guys like me LOVE!

Between all of the restaurants, shops, Marquee and all the pools on the property there was never a lack of things to do.  Speaking of the pool, you HAVE to try out the Neapolitan at the main pool for some booze infused ice cream.  \\n  The spa is a little pricey but it is very clean and has plenty of work out machines to use.  A little suggestion, I used the main gym in the West (?) Tower and had a $20 per day fee...A different time, I used the smaller gym in the East tower with no charge.  Not saying it will work for you, but it's worth a try.  \\n  A final note...if you drive you are going to LOVE the parking garage.

Almost $15 for a martini. \\nBy 10 the place was pounding pretty good, I have to say their sound/lighting system was pretty awesome. I just don't want to see women old enough to be my mom shaking their asses on the stage. If you're in the 40-60 range and looking for a solid place to party, and relive your 20s, THIS is probably your spot..... \\nNot trying to be rude to the older crowd, I think its damn cool that you still know how to party....I just don't want to be there while you are! And a friendly heads up to the 21-39 crowd to avoid this place, unless you're looking for love from an older guy/girl.\\nReally my 1st Club-Type(but not really a club) experience in Phoenix. It was a pleasant surprise that nobody was really being a drunken slob like so many club type environments in Chicagoland. I'm not sure if I can attribute that to the age group or Phoenix in general. \\nEither way, not a place I'd go to again......\\nTip to Management/Owner.....Having grown up in the Chicagoland Club Scene in the 90s and 00s, if you're going to have a club environment, have room for people to dance. Ditch all the tables in the 1st room in lieu of a dance floor.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

We make sure to go here every time we visit Las Vegas. One last thing that made me enjoy this restaurant even more. There was an older couple next to us that looked as if they were from Duck Dynasty or some other hillbilly lifestyle.

I really liked the fact that this cat cafe had nooks and crannies/crevices for for the cats to hide and sleep in. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that our food took FOREVER to get to your table.

Located on the north part of the strip in a bad area, I wouldn't walk outside towards the main part of the strip, (Caesar's Palace, Mirage, Treasure Island, Venetian, the Flamingo Hotel) but if you insist of walking outside at night to gaze in the Vegas lights. Stay with a big group and ladies, carry pepper spray if you're traveling alone. \\n\\nThe one thing I like about Circus Circus is the price and the cheap eats compared to the strip. Although the casino is not as fancy as the newer hotels, I love playing the clown slots and some of the staff was ok in terms of customer service. The clientele reflects the condition and price of the hotel. Entertainment options like the infamous, Free Circus Acts, the huge arcade, and the Adventure Dome (Formally the Grand Slam Canyon) are what draws me back to Circus Circus.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

        "data": "Review:\nThis is one of my favorite south Tempe haunts of late!  It has a relaxed feel, and a far more spacious dining area than the other Tempe location.  The Pasty is a unique little pocket of delight!  Originating as traditional miner's fare in Cornwall, England, the Pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting, nontraditional Pasties upon it's arrival to Tempe, AZ.  Although the more traditional Shepard's pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor, there is now a Royal with Cheese, a Chicken Tikka Masala, and many more fun-filled pasties to try!  For those of you that have had a Pasty in England, this will not be what you are expecting because the Pasty here is much larger.  There are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.  Go without the expectation for traditional English fare and the Pasty will not disappoint!  Aside from the yummy pasties, the setting of The Cornish Pasty is cozy and fun.  The Jukebox there is awesome....playing everything, classic rock, psychedelic, new wave, etc.  At night, the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.  They have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a long indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.  The staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and alluring and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.  They serve a nice assortment of beer in a nice array of sizes.  I love the Pasty and I love to recommend it because it is unique and just plain delicious!  If you haven't had a pasty yet, you should!!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

This was hands down one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. \\n\\nWalking in, we were greeted right away, and sat right away. After being seated, we had to wait about 15 minutes until we were even looked at by anyone. Finally, we were approached by our waiter, who said he would be with us in a few minutes. What?! The fifteen minute wait wasn't bad enough? \\n\\nWhen he finally came bakc ,we ordered our drinks. We all got alcoholic drinks - and I also asked for some tap water to go alone with my meal. Upon returning, he brought back water in a glass bottle. Now, I've been to restaurants before, where they put their tap water in glass bottles to make it look more fancy - so I thought that's what this restaurant did too. WRONG. \\n\\nAfter seeing a couple tables next to us, with just regular cups of water, we flagged down our waiter to ask if this was the TAP water we had asked for. He said no, and that they charged for each bottle. We asked how much it was for each bottle, and he said he didn't know and would go find out. There were two things wrong with this situation:\\n     1. How the hell do you not know how much a bottle of water costs? As a server, you should know your menu inside and out. \\n      2. It took him fifteen minutes to get back to us with a price, which meant we went fifteen minutes without anything to drink, because we had all finished our drinks as well as the water. \\n\\n0 stars for service. \\n\\nAs for the food, bleh. Everything was salty and overcooked. They came by our table at least fifteen times with sausage, but we were only offered their beef items a few times. As for their salad bar, they had a lot of choices, but none of them really worth while. I will say that their chimichurri sauce was pretty good. Actually, it was the highlight of the meal. It was the only thing that was actually good. \\n\\nI would never set foot in this place again. HORRIBLE service, and sub par food.

Even though they were starving they didn't even want to finish the rolls.\\n\\nThe pad thai was AWFUL! The only good thing about it was the giant shrimp that came with it.

There's one just south of the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, but on the Arizona side, this has to be it. Though there's one on the naval base at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, private citizens can't go onto the campus, so it essentially is inaccessible for about 95% of the population. It almost makes one want to join the military, actually.\\n\\nFor all intents and purposes, and as crazy as it sounds, this Dunkin' is one of the closest ones to the people of the Los Angeles region.\\n\\nI spent the past Thanksgiving weekend in Phoenix, and I stopped by here each morning as part of my ritual whenever I visit a city where Dunkin' Donuts flourish. I would get up before the rest of my family, and enjoy a donut and regular coffee (raspberry, creamed and sugared), as the crowds and lines would slowly start to form. If you follow my reviews, this crowding after I arrive always occurs whenever I visit a restaurant or establishment, and it happened each morning during the Thanksgiving weekend here. \\n\\nOnce my order was claimed, I always insisted on eating there, as I don't like eating in my vehicle, or really having food in it. There is a drive-thru here, however, for those that don't care for the interiors of their cars. I do like how this location delegates the coffee making responsibility to others, and to have you pick up your order off to the side; it makes for faster overall service with the rest of the queue.\\n\\nI'm actually one of those people who always completes those surveys on the receipts so as to get a free donut on my next visit. Considering that I essentially swing by each day, doing those surveys is essentially a 50% discount off my bill each visit, and I really only pay for the coffee.

I liked that they had a \\\"\"To Go\\\"\" window from which you could order from (line wasn't too bad but got longer later), but I wouldn't pay that much money again for it.

This kindness was shown again and again throughout the 30 or so minutes that I was there and I honestly felt the staff was super kind and inviting.  As for the inside of the restaurant it looked like, well, a pizza shop.  A small counter to order from, lots of booths and an area to wait.  There was also some cool instrumental music of current pop songs playing in the background which I thought was awesome.\\n\\nFor my pizza cones I went with both a pepperoni cone and mafia cone while my fianc\\u00e9 went with the meditteranean cone and a dessert Nutella cone.  Honestly I wasn't quite sure what to make of the cones whenever they got to the table.  They were somewhat thick and clearly made of a pizza like dough.  However they proved to be perfect at keeping everything in the cone while not overwhelming the toppings. Overall the inside tasted like a good pizza with copious amounts of all the right toppings.  My fianc\\u00e9s Nutella cone was made of a crepe like cone and topped with with whipped cream.  While this cone was a bit more fragile and thereby messy, my fianc\\u00e9 loved the cone and Nutella pairing.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While it's not going to replace the traditional pizza places for me I still think it's worth a stop.

Maybe they do things differently in CA.\\n\\nPlan B: Go to the Bellagio fountain show..which was wonderful as they had the show to the tune Lady Luck by Frank Sinatra..ahh...classic Vegas..on the way back, we walked past OLives and I thought well I have to at least get a birthday drink and they had 2 seats open. The bartender poured well ..got our money's worth, not watered down like most restaurants ( that is why I make my own most of the time). Didn't have dinner, too expensive and needed a reservation though the seating was practically empty for the tables..went to see the Monet exhibit and get dessert elsewhere..\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Today, I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps, 25% beef in dish only, there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish, and was drenched in oil. Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad.

She told me they had purchased a big plan so then could spend time shooting these very cool guns with their grown kids but they had no ideal there was a time limit until the range master began rushing them, \\\"\"that's why she walked out\\\"\" she said it was a waste of a few hundred dollars. I told here next time try Pro Gun Club or Range702. So my experience at this hack gun range was not an isolated experience so beware of this place and just go Range702, Pro Gun Club, Green Valley gun range or the Gun store you will be happier I'm not sure of the other ranges near the strip.

Im thinking taco tuesday worst case scenario i have 2 drinks spend like $20 including tip.\\n\\nI walled in with sweatpants, a painted on carolina t-shirt and an almost invisible F-off on my forehead since ive been working 14 hr days lately. Sat at the bar, never got a menu. Salsa was fresh however lacked taste and heat. Thats one of those thing a Mexican restaurant has to get right.\\n\\nEveryone at the bar was ordering their veggie tacos so i joined them. I ordered 3, only one of them had a piece of a plantain. I guess they could have put less filling on it, but i might have sent it back. They were worth a dollar, thats it!  I would have been just as satisfied at taco bell.  They use corn tortillas which i am not a fan of. It might have been better if they were fresh, but they did not taste fresh.\\n\\nThe bartender had a large section so i cut her some slack. Their shots could have been smaller. I ordered the first which looked like a one ounce pour and i figured she was just busy and made a mistake. I probably should've told her to pour it back in the bottle, but i figured they had $1 tacos, so whatever. I just really wanted a drink. So i ordered another and the same crappy pour. I guess this is normal for them. Maybe she was using the rest of my pour to hook up one of her friends laters.\\n\\nGot the tab. It was 26.00. They charge 2.25 for soda, i guess its not terrible but its been a while since I've paid for one at a sit down establishment. The (crappy pour) drinks were $9 a piece, if i would have known that, i would have definitely told her to pour that back in the bottle. This place is definitely cheap(as far as delivering value to their customers), maybe they should cut their labor cost and use it towards improving what they serve.\\n\\nMy recommendation: only go there if you have to.  Order beer out the bottle or can. They might try to give you a 13oz draft or something. Never order liquor there.  Make sure you get all of whats supposed to be on your plate.

The first time I ate there, I had breakfast, today I had a sandwich with artichoke, spinach, cheese and mayo. Both were excellent.  Everyone in my party today also loved their meals. The apple pancakes, which were the special of the day, were melt-in-your mouth amazing and the cute rainbow of fruit served on the side was clearly very fresh. I love Crema's small, cozy atmosphere, the fun colorful plates, and of course, their delicious food.\\n\\nSadly, however, I cannot give Crema a five-star review.  I was extremely disappointed today at the customer service and how a mistake was handled. When our food was brought to our table, an order of children's pancakes was missing.  We asked the server about it.  In my opinion, his response should have immediately been, \\\"\"I am so sorry, I will get those right out to you.\\\"\"  Instead, he said he would have to look at the ticket. A couple of minutes later he returned to let us know that there had been only one order of pancakes on our menu. This was a error on their part.  We ordered two - one apple, one regular. There were clearly two children standing with my husband when he ordered.  Then, again, instead of immediately getting us our pancakes, the server suggested that my husband should go and place another order.  So my husband waited in line (behind five other patrons - it was lunch on Mother's Day) to order the same pancakes that he had previous ordered.  By the time he finally got back to the table, his meal was cold, and by the time my son's pancakes finally arrived, the rest of us had finished our meals. This was their mistake, yet we were the ones that ended up with late food, cold food, and having to stand in line multiple times.  No one apologized. It was just a bummer - and the table next to us had an issue with their order, as well.  \\n\\nFood wise - this place is perfect.

Moving beyond portion size, however, HH is not as big on flavor. \\n\\nI ordered the chicken and waffles-- the chicken (with the requisite sprig of rosemary) was crisp and moist, but rather bland. The belgian waffles had large pieces of bacon mixed into the batter and thus cooked into the waffle. Sadly, all I could taste was bacon. The 'maple reduction' drizzled around the waffle reminded me of a balsamic reduction and didn't really help. A side of syrup perked it up, but overall, hard to say it is worth ~$14. \\n\\nMy cousin had the corned beef hash- big pieces of corned beef but otherwise just as bland as my food.

I recently visited FC for a saturday afternoon tasting.  Now, all of the wine tasted was meant to be drunk NOW.  This wasn't a high-end tasting but that's exactly the point.  We left the tasting with two cases of good wine, wine we'll drink most evenings, and paid less than $9 a bottle.  Good luck finding a better deal anywhere in town.  Fine Cellars is serious about fair pricing on good, easy drinking wines.  Care for something more up-town?  This is your place for once-a-year Turley allocations or any number of terrific bottles.  Chateau Montelena, Schaffer, Freemark Abbey, they're all here.  Looking for something truly special?

A tour you can take that teaches you about whisky.\\nb. A bar/tasting room you go to at the end of the tour.\\nc. A gift shop where you can buy bottles of whisky and various souvenirs. \\nd. A restaurant (which I did not go to). \\n\\nThe tour itself is a combination of interesting and cheesy. It starts off with an \\\"\"educational\\\"\" amusement park-style ride that you might find in Epcot Center. You sit in a barrel-shaped cart that goes down a track while a hologram explains the process of making whiskey to you in the language of your choice. No, I'm not making this up.\\n\\nFollowing that you go into a room where an actual non-holographic human being gives you scratch-and-sniff cards and teaches you about the four regions of whisky-making in Scotland.

It's an impressive collection and very well presented. I believe you can pay more to take the last tour of the day which allows you to spend more time in the collection room. I found it interesting, but didn't feel like I was missing out on anything by mainly looking at the collection as a whole, and not examining each individual bottle. \\n\\nFinally, the tour exits into the tasting room.

The water has been shut off 3 or more times. (often without warning) And, it's been off as long as an entire work day.

I tip. I tip 20% across the board, unless the service is bad enough to dip below that or stellar enough to warrant more.

In an attempt to shrug me off, he was vague, and claimed I probably wouldn't be able to find them. \\n\\nI did.\\n\\nI called back and informed him of this, but said that if he could find the parts domestically (as what I found was in the UK), to let me know. I wait the weekend and call back to inquire, but as the phone is handed from the girl working the desk and the owner, I hear him say, \\\"\"Can we just give this back to him?\\\"\" I was shocked at this kind of attitude towards a customer that was nothing but perhaps a little too persistant. After an unpleasant exchange, including a crack about my mental stability, I decided to pick it up.\\n\\nThe story gets crazier here.\\n\\nWhen I go in, I'm in a VERY poor mood. I ask for the tape duplicator, and ask why this was such and issue and why I had been  treated so poorly. I had been thinking it, but I decided to call him out on his incompetence. The unit did not include a plastic bag I had given it to them with, so I demanded one. This resulted in the man giving me a very threatening motion and insulting me. I repeated my demand, got the bag, exchanged insults, and left.\\n\\nThen I realize he didn't give me the power cable for the unit.\\n\\nI called back and demanded it, but his reply was to say that I forgot it, and that he wouldn't return it.

Did not explain dishes correctly, did not ask how any of our plates tasted.  When my wife pointed out something on her plate which didn't taste good, his words were, \\\"\"oh, ok\\\"\".  After a while we decided to relate or communication with the host.  \\n\\nThe food was a big disappointment, which seems to be normal for Pittsburgh.  Appetizer of Mozzarella and Prosciutto was way too large.  The cheese was bland, and the prosciutto sub par in taste.  Nothing creative on the plate, just slices of meat, a big ball of cheese, some vinegar, and a roasted yellow pepper compote (which actually tasted nice).  The other appetizer was Polenta which was smothered in what we believe to be a ragout which used canned mushrooms.  If they were not canned then they were made far too early for this service, or quite possibly the day before.  This plate was a major crash - terrible.\\n\\nAfter this we shared a salad of endive and radicchio which had way too much Pecorino, not enough acid in the vinaigrette, and was chopped very sloppy in the kitchen.  The plate was boring and not tasty.  I asked for a lemon to add some vibrancy and acidity to the dish, this was the only way to give it life.\\n\\nOn to the mains:\\n\\nMy wife had duck.  First let me say the duck on the plate was cooked outstanding, but everything else on the plate was terrible and didn't make sense.  I think the duck was cooked sous vide, as it was perfectly moist.  This led me to think, \\\"\"how can this chef have so many bland and imperfect dishes, but nail the duck\\\"\".  Quite possibly this technique of cooking duck came from another restaurant chef in town?  hmmm, Salt of The Earth?\\n\\nI ordered what they called a lamb steak.  Very tough and chewy, over salted, and way too large.  It was paired with crispy gnocchi which had no chance of being crispy because they laid the steak on top of the gnocchi.

Bad idea. The bathroom had a layer of dust all over the place, the shower handle actually had mold growing inside and to top it all off the hot water pipes inside the wall were hitting against the wall and making a very loud rattiling.

Which was fine by us. We picked up a pastry to hold us over and I ordered a bloody mary. Ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing. You can either go to the bar separately to order one, or order one at the food counter like I did. But then I had to go to the bar and tell the bartender that I ordered a bloody mary, and give him my table number. I guess they go by the honors system. \\n\\nThe self seating system can be a little chaotic, and you may have to wait around for people to leave.

I had looked through the truck at upack but was in trust mode at that point.  The gist of that is I have some missing stuff but don't know for sure that it was the 2 men.  I later inquired the business if anything had shown up that they didn't know who it belonged to, but received no response.\\nThis lack of response was also related to my complaint about the costs I was actually charged of $286.

The best times were when Mike and Sherman ran the bar. Mike is one of the most professional, upbeat, positive employees that ever worked there. Recently things changed and the old miserable bartenders were back in place of Mike. I'm sorry but Ofelia is a bitter old miserable person and she is extremely rude and she is slow. Omar has no personality and is boring. Now I've been coming here a long time on a regular basis but over the last couple of months this place has deteriorated, the quality of the food is not what it used to be and more over just the public display of unprofessionalism of the staff. I witnessed two female employees argue and call each other a b*tch in the dining area. The employees openly talk bad about each other in front of customers. I was in the bar once and Ofelia referred to Sherman in a derogatory racial slur as he walked away from the bar area. I've never witnessed such unethical business practices in a dining establishment.  The majority of your staff is extremely unprofessional. Your restaurant wouldn't survive a day in the real corporate world with the level of unethical behavior that occurs there. I stopped by today and I asked to sit on my regular section with Mike, I was told by your hostess that Mike no longer worked there that he was fired. Not only should that information be confidential from a human resources perspective but the smile on your hostess face sealed my decision to not come to your establishment again. I turned around and left. I have hosted numerous business functions there and now I will be hosting them at other places. I think your staff needs a complete overhaul starting with your management. A business is only as good as the management hired to run it and I'm sorry to say you suck at it.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

It's not like a buffet where we are trying to get lunch prices for a dinner buffet..it's the same shiz.  One last person arrived at 2:59 and they made a stink that HE absolutely had to pay the dinner price. Okay fine, take your extra 3 dollars you crazy people.\\n\\nThen we ate and I definitely didn't eat my moneys worth. Sushi looks like it's from a grocery store. Nothing special, tastes old.\\n\\nI'm sorry but when your sushi is gross don't be so determined to charge the higher price. They were rude about the whole process too and like I said, the sushi sucks.  The first time I went there they started bringing rolls no one ordered and when we said that they argued with us then and put it on our table anyway.

After I checked it I found a lot of problems like the reflector not being fastened tight (thus the rattle),three spokes that were loose, the front wheel wasn't fastened down tight enough, the seat was loose and sliding around and they didn't put cable crimps at the end of any of the cables to stop them from fraying. I even adjusted the brakes. The upsell of a LBS(local bike shop) is supposed to be, in theory, they assemble the bike professionally rather than a Walmart or Target where a stock person does it when they have the time and with little knowledge.\\n\\nService: This place is fairly close to my home so I'll go there for parts if I'm in a pinch. Twice I've called down to see if they have a part in stock and when I get there 20 minutes later and I get the old \\\"\"we must have just sold it, but we DO have this OTHER part which...\\\"\" Really? you just sold that specific part at 7pm on a winters night?

The restaurants and shopping options are great. The connection to the Palazzo and Grand Canal Shoppes is extremely convenient.

It isnt hard to make a salad or miso soup quicker than someone else is making sushi.  Especially a salad that is just greens and dressing and a soup that is already made and just broth. The lobster roll for $20 is fake lobster.  We are sitting here in our room at the Hilton feeling sick afterwards.  Shame on you Benihanas for allowing such a sub standard sushi bar in your restaurant.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

The information was there, but arranged in ways that didn't create a narrative. Some of the most interesting facts I got came from clicking on little plate icons in an oddly presented touchscreen section that likened each city to a meal and the country as a dinner table (or something like that). But the biggest and most eye catching items didn't give me any kind of new and robust understanding of history. The multimedia courtroom space was lovely but the actor portrayals weren't. The enormous \\\"\"crime in Las Vegas\\\"\" connection screen was more confusing than anything else. And the section dedicated to mob movies was clearly more of a tourist draw than anything of substance.\\n\\nI get that museums have to walk a balance between drumming up business and providing actual content. But I think that The Mob Museum skewed way too far into glamorizing crime for sake of ticket sales and avoided the \\\"\"what did we learn about the world through the lens of this museum\\\"\" question far too much.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Not just Italian restaurants. I'm just as disappointed by AZ yelpers who think they know what authentic NY style is. So it was, with trepidation, that I heeded the advice of the reviews previous to this one, and booked a table for ten for a pre theater dinner. Well, you see the five stars. How good is RigaTony ?\\nLets start with service. We were pretty late for our 4:30 reservation after being stuck in traffic on the 10. They held the table, no problem, on a very busy evening. Even though we ordered our plates after 5 we got the early bird specials and the $3 glasses of wine. Again, not a problem. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and very efficient. Sodas and waters were refilled without prompting. Sorry, I didn't get her name. \\nThe food. Fresh Chapati comes to the table almost immediately . There are bottles of olive oil and small dishes of freshly chopped garlic too.  Make your own concoction. The early bird pasta dishes offer a good variety of  pasta and accompaniment, are plentiful, tasty and offered in fresh semolina or whole wheat and a great value at $6.95. Three of us ordered the veal parm which we all agreed was tender, tasty, and large enough to satisfy. The sauce was thick, tangy and garlicky, much like Carmines or many of the midtown (Manhattan) Italian eateries. Also ordered at our table was lasagna and a clam and mussel dish. All were very happy with their meal. The tab for it all was very reasonable.\\nThis is not a franchise restaurant. It is the real deal. RigaTony could make it in NY. The fact that it is in Tempe is, i think, fantastic.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

We both had steaks, one a filet and the other a ribeye, both of which were expertly cooked to order.  He added shrimp and I crab legs, neither of which was as large as I'm used to, being from the coast.  But it's understandable this far inland, and both were cooked and seasoned well.\\n\\nWe each ordered a side, mushrooms and broccolini, and let me tell you, each was large enough to serve two people.

The reverse happy hour prices for a few drinks and tasty sushi rolls were impressive!  Comparing this place to RA, I'd choose Kabuki.  The cosmopolitan was not quite up to my standards, so that's the only deduction from five stars, but maybe that's just not one of their signature cocktails.

With our drink orders placed we decided to read over the menu and then make our selections.  We started with the Shady Sticks and were happy with those.  All they are is a pizza with the sauce on the side for dipping.  I mean it's like a medium sized pizza, so a very good portion and the dough was so sweet and mixed with the three types of cheese on it was great.  For my main course I opted for the California BLT.  When I ordered this I was assuming that it was going to be run of the mill, thrown together BLT.  Was I ever surprised.  Multigrain bread topped with applewood bacon, crispy lettuce and thickly sliced tomatoes.  I was most surprised by the tomatoes, I was expecting uniformly cut and small.  What I got was like someone took a tomato from a basket, cut it quickly and didn't care how it looked, I approve!\\n\\nNow, back to those tater tots!  I am completely infatuated with them.  They were crunchy and puffy and so delightful.  Just the right size to pop in your mouth and munch away.  Their side of Cajun ranch is an amazing compliment.  I was as near to heaven as I could be with those, no joke.\\n\\nI also opted for the blackberry mojito.  Best way to describe it is by saying it was bittersweet.  The mint played off of the blackberry and it played well.\\n\\nSeating was nice, at a high table, we were at the corner that we could not only people watch inside the restaurant, but we could also people watch on the sidewalk.

Prior to actually eating here, I had visited Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for just drinks. The drinks were made well and the prices seemed fair. They have a pretty good selection of wines bottled & on tap. The beers average about $6 but you can get a pitcher for about $12. It's a great deal and even better if you go during happy hour. The bar has a great atmosphere and the bartenders are all very friendly. After a few fun experiences of just hanging out at the bar, I finally actual got a chance to eat here this weekend! It was AMAZING! \\n\\nFirst we started with their soup of the day, Black Bean Sirloin Chili. We ordered a side of bread to go with it so we could all share it as an appetizer.. It was the perfect way to start our meal. Lots of flavor and they don't skimp on the sirloin portions. For dinner I had the Vegetable Platter, my husband had the Half Chicken, my mom had the BBQ Brisket, and my dad had the Short Ribs. The Vegetable platter was shockingly very filling and had tons of flavor. I was afraid I would miss eating meat for dinner, but I ended up not missing it at all. It was perfect! The kale had a great garlicky flavor and the tomatoes and blue cheese mix is now one of my favorite flavor combinations that I'm definitely going to try to mimic at home. I got to taste a bite of all the dishes my family ordered too had they were all great. The chicken was super moist and had a slight sweetness in flavor. The ribs & brisket were both tender and booming with flavor as well. \\n\\nWhere this restaurants loses a star is because of the sides. Aside from my vegetable platter, All the other side dishes were really lacking in flavor and added nothing the main course. The grits seemed a little mushy and didn't have the flavor your would expect from the Jalepeno. The orzo was just average too.

During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.  \\n\\nDaytime:\\nThe pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the \\\"\"worst and trashiest\\\"\". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.\\n\\nNighttime:\\nMuch improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.\\n\\nRooms:\\nI've been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Unfortunately, despite getting seated right away, we weren't attended to right away at our table.  Don't get me wrong.  The server was nice but when one is tired and hungry, niceness can only get so far.  \\n\\nWhen she finally made her way to our table, my sister-in-law ordered the infamous oxtail soup (now priced at $9.99), my brother ordered the wonton min, and I customized my omelette with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, bacon, & spam.  The food itself was okay.  Nothing to shout on rooftops about.  My omelette was okay, though the combination of spam and bacon made it super salty towards the end, since there were big clumps of them at the other end of my omelette.  The hash browns were okay.  Didn't taste the wonton min but my brother seemed to like it.  I did taste the infamous oxtail soup.  It comes with a cup of rice which my sister-in-law devoured.  The oxtail is cooked perfectly, with the meat falling off the bone easily.  The broth is pretty good but I suppose that since I am Filipino, I'm accustomed to eating oxtail with a peanut sauce (a dish called Kare-kare).  So although the oxtail and the broth was good separately, together, I was looking for something more.  I don't think I'd ever order it again.\\n\\nDid I mention that our food arrived and we still had no drinks at our table.  When I flagged the waitress down and asked for water, she only brought one for me.  It wasn't until she noticed the shocked look on my brother's face that she made her way back with water for both my brother and sister-in-law as well.

Has plenty of room to practice your 40 yard pitches without killing anyone or being yelled at. Pracitce in the sand because you will likely hit one of the 119 bunkers on the course! Staff is great and my starter Steve had PLENTY of knowledge about the course. Food was fantastic as well especially for the price. Paid 7 for a drink, sandwich, and chips. The sandwich was large and sustaining. Overall the course reminds me of where they played the pga championship in south carolina visually. Probably my favorite was not risking hitting a house and the silence that is never there when playing at most courses in Arizona. Conditions were great for the time of the season a month before overseeding begins. Some bunkers were underconstruction but were playable.

Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.

With that said referred to a new host from a friend of mine as myself and 7 friends headed to Las Vegas for a 4 night stay and 3 days of top shelf golf, food, fun etc.  I will as I get time detail each restaurant and golf course individually.  This is simply the Aria and its set up.  My New Host Nicole Houng was arrainged and she set up King Sized rooms 3 non smoking and 1 smoking for the gamblers in the group. The other 4 guys set up their rooms on their own.   All Rooms confirmed via email and very specific regarding type of room set up. If you recall my last trip outside the Mandalay Bay or Bellagio the Cosmopolitan was a complete phuck up.  This I hoped would go smoother.\\n\\nWe all arrived fairly late in the evening approximately 10-11PM Local time.  on Wednesday evening. Upon check in we were told only the 1 Smoking bed king was available and all others would be queen beds only for night one. Reading the reviews from other clients it appears this is the # 1 complaint. Either they don't have enough kings or they simply do not honor reservations.  Being from a casino reservation you would expect the king beds to be saved but alas it was not to be.  I had a short an animated conversation with front desk manager Ron Miller and told him this would not happen at the Mandalay Bay.  His Response and I quote \\\"\" If you would like for us to take you over to the Mandalay Bay we will be happy to\\\"\".   I literally was about to jump over the counter and smack the guy I was so pissed off with the complete and utter disrespect he seemed to sense it and backed off. Bottom line NO KING BEDS a bad start.\\n\\nCheck in and the queens and rooms are  pretty dam special.

The kitchen reminds me of the one in Hell's Kitchen! Everything looked really nice; nice ambiance and food presentation.\\n\\nNow, for the food.  We ordered the Wagyu beef carpaccio, clam chowder, lobster mac 'n' cheese and filet mignon.  Btw, the bread basket was good too...nice variety.  The beef carpaccio was OK...a little too much of the wasabi flavor.  The clam chowder and lobster mac 'n' cheese...MMMmmmm!!  Both were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS (I also generally a fan of mac 'n' cheese)!!  However, I expected much more lobster in the mac 'n'cheese.  The filet mignon was alright; whatever sauce they plated the filet with was salty.  I asked for the meat to be cooked to Medium and it was still pretty juicy--I've had much better for about half the price.\\n\\nIf I was rating based on the main dish alone I would go with 3 stars.

It would've been more appropriate to call it Salty Beef with 2 Basil Leaves.  It was fairly oily, I chalk that up to low quality ground beef being utilized.  I had to ask for hot sauce/chili flakes as the spice level was more like a 1/2-1...not 3.  This was the blandest (minus the salt) example of the dish I've had anywhere.\\n\\nHer Sweet & Sour Chicken on the other hand is more like a Spicy & Sour Chicken...lot's of heat.

My friends order came out 11 minutes before mine did. The owner clearly saw that we had been waiting a while for the second burger, but he just asked a staff member to check on it rather than find out himself. It wasn't busy as we went around 1:30 pm. Second reason I am disappointed was I ordered my burger without cheese. When my order finally came out, it was clear they scraped off the cheese. I could still see melted cheese on it that had been wiped off. It could have been they reused the same bun and toppings and made a new burger patty, hence the long wait...but either way there was cheese on part of it, then wiped off. I did inform the owner who apologized and gave me a $5 off coupon for my next visit. For a burger that was $8 without fries, this was somewhat insulting especially after he informed me the cook made a new burger. Either I was lying or he was. They offered to make me a new one but I wasn't wanting to wait another 15 minutes. After all was said and done, I ate less than about half the burger as it was very soggy and I was ready to just leave. The $5 coupon isn't enough incentive to get me to try it again. That's a shame as I was hoping it would be a great neighborhood joint like Fired Pie next door is.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

It is focused a little more on the classically reputable producers, and the major regions, as I suppose that is what the clientele demands. There are some great gems there, and the sommelier is rather gracious in helping you seek them out. It is a little odd that they would serve Veuve by the glass... with such a refined cuisine, it might be more appropriate to serve a wine that is not mass produced to such a high level (but again, that might just be what the clientele demands). \\n\\nThe thing that impressed me the most about this place is how well thought out all of the dishes were. All of the flavors of each and every item that came out were perfectly balanced. It created a situation where the whole was truly greater than the sum of its parts.

The wine that was recommended to us, although okay, was nothing special and, they only had two bottles, meaning we had to switch mid-way thorough the meal.  Every quality steakhouse I've ever been to has always notified us of a low inventory BEFORE serving the wine, especially when we've had a group of 5-7 people.  Not a major issue with SW but it just shows a lack of finesse, especially when paying a minimum of $54 for an a la carte steak.\\n\\nOn to the food...\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the steaks are FANTASTIC.  The veal chop that was ordered by a fellow diner also received rave reviews.  I had the smallest steak offered, a 9oz filet, cooked medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Another diner had the same steak only cooked medium well and his only (small issue) was that had specifically requested it be cooked with a thin line of pink and there was no pink at all.  But, he had zero complaints on the flavor or the texture - it was buttery and juicy and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Rib-eyes were ordered by the rest of the table and all greatly enjoyed their steaks.\\n\\nAs with most (all?) high-end steakhouses, all sides are ordered a la carte.  At SW, the sides are $12 each with the sauteed wild mushrooms and grilled asparagus being the exception as they are $16 each.  All the sides are large enough to share but the potatoes gratin is quite small and unless everyone takes a very small portion, it would only serve 3.

In the booth by the window on the south side, there were dead bugs, old food, melted crayons and other things I couldn't identify which looked like they had been there for months, not to mention the dust. I can handle the occasional mixed up order, the bad service and the constant interruption, but I cannot get past the bug thing.

We knew it would be rather expensive but were ok with that as we were expecting the food to be exceptional. \\n\\nTo start with, it's a bit out of the way. you have to walk through all the shops and the entire Bellagio Casino to get there. We came from Caesars which in theory should not be that far but it took us about 20 minutes to walk there. \\n\\nWhen we got there, they let us know they had a fixed menu since it was a holiday (Valentine's Day) it was $145 per person which was a little more than what I would have ordered from their regular menu, but again, I was ok with it because I was expecting sensational food. \\n \\nThe meal was a seven course meal which took entirely too long between courses. I know they were busy, but it was about 20 minutes between courses, and dinner took 3 plus hours. It was uncomfortable to sit for that long. We were so tired of sitting and waiting that we were tempted to leave before the main course - which was strip steak.  (It was really good by the way - I would probably give it an 7/10). \\n\\nThe lobster pot pie that everyone raves about was just ok. It wasn't bad, but I was expecting something better and it was very rich. Combined with the very rich caviar parfait and the muse, and oyster soup that was also part of the dinner, it was WAY too much richness, in fact, by the time I got to the pot pie I could barely eat any because my stomach couldn't handle all that rich food. It needed something lighter and more acidic to break it up. The whole meal was just too heavy. \\n\\nAll in all we spent about $400 with drinks and gratuity, and for the money it wasn't worth it. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and go across the street to Paris @ Gordon Ramsay Steak. We ate there the next night. It was half the price and much better!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Penn's was good, so good that I went outside of my comfort zone to try different textures and flavors that I never thought I'd try. Lunch, dinner, persuading my family to pay a bit more and give them a try, I had Penn's at 5 stars and showed my support with my feet walking in the door and spending $50 minimum on my night orders and giving 25% tips for lunch.\\n\\nThat was then. The love I had for Penn's has been crushed. I visited about 2 months ago hoping to rekindle the love and happy Thai food experience I missed. Instead the food made my family sick and my sister in law said never again. I would pass over Sunset on the 95 and look over at the green neon at night...And wish for the old days. \\n\\nThen came word of Penn's making it onto the dreaded Channel 13 Dirty Dining segment. I read the story, SNHD said Penn's hired a top food safety expert to clean them up. I found myself craving good spicy Thai...and through strange circumstances I found myself with 45 minutes to spare and I'm 3 blocks away. Off I went...would I be able to find happiness again? Had the expert done his job? This is Vegas, sometimes you gotta take a chance....\\n\\nThe building is the same, but the soulless lunch plate of chili mint chicken and boring egg roll and circa 1980 school cafeteria grade egg drop soup left no doubt in my mind that the Penn's I loved was gone. Tack on the extra $1 for using a debit card under $10 and service that was cold and aloof and when I walked out the door I said I was done. I believe in redemption and giving second chances. Penn's got that opportunity...and they blew it. \\n\\nWhen it was good, it warranted placement on my Mythical 6th Star list. Now it's just a waste of commercial space. \\n\\nBetter alternatives are less than 15 minutes away. You would be better off to use the Yelp app and find them. 1 Star, under protest....what a shame.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

It is cool, it is refreshing, it has a great citrus flavor to it and the absinthe in it, doesnt hurt either. \\n\\nI also enjoyed the pretzel fondue which was a recommendation from the waiter... yeah.... I would suggest you give that a go, but I am sure you will find other amazing appetizers as well.\\n\\nWe got to CD early for dinner... this is critical on two fronts, first, we could easily get a table and second I could order the Korean spiced Rib-eye cap, which is limited in daily availability.  If you can get it, do, it is most certainly worth having... actually, I dont think I have ever had a better cut of meat. \\n\\nThe service is terrific and the atmosphere is definitely a lot of fun.  Our waiter was always spot on on his recommendations and very attentive.\\n\\nSadly there is a bit of a downside to this place:  It is in the heart of Scottsdale and the clientele in the restaurant was on the whole the very stereotypical self-centered, pompous, rude, snobbery that after growing up in Scottsdale I used to claim was false... having lived outside of the bubble for a while I can tell you that the crowd is overall pretty disgusting.  The herd of 20k millionaires and other nefarious customers does tend to make the atmosphere a bit loud because these people do want everyone else to know just how \\\"\"amazing\\\"\" they are and how \\\"\"wonderful\\\"\" their life is.

The gift certificate was for me to come back and have those shirts laundered on the store's dime. \\n\\nFirst, he didn't have to give a gift certificate - he completed the order as requested. Secondly, he didn't have to take the time to call and explain the certificate and the reasons behind it.  I will gladly accept this paper gift certificate in the amount of $10 and return future business to this location!\\n\\nThat is customer service, and it is rare today.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

It's a unique place and very few restaurants in the city have a similar vibe or menu.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Awesome! It's right downtown and in the midst of the cultural district happenings. It's also a little dark inside, but very eclectic, with a trendy, gastropub vibe and drawings of cows (which I enjoy).\\n\\nFood: Here is where I love and also a little torn. I loved what I had, but I felt like there was a bit of an identity crisis involved. The food was eclectic, but also kind of random. They are called \\\"\"meat and potatoes\\\"\" but didn't really have the menu that reflected that name. Maybe that's meant to be the irony, for which case, they did fine. For example, if you wanted just a steak (I'm not a steak person, btw), then you'd have to order the steak offering that is for 2 people. You'd think that a simple option, like steak, is what this place would own. Otherwise, the mussels for an appetizer were great and I also loved my entree (but to be honest, I don't remember what I got now).\\n\\nService: Pretty decent, although our server seemed to be in a bad mood and the others around us seemed to have a server that enjoyed what they were doing. This may have improved the experience quite a bit.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Ugh, ok, let's just get this over with.\\n\\nFirst of all, why did I even come here? Because it was Friday night and my family wanted to go out and my dad hates any place with live music, crowds, noise, and \\\"\"lots of energy.\\\"\" So Buffalo Wild Wings is the perfect place to go if you hate people and fun, basically. And my brother wanted to go here because they have trivia, which by the way is also not fun because if I am one thing I am fucking competitive and I hate losing and will go out of my way to try to ruin the fun for everyone else if I do. Also the game itself is full of either esoteric questions or totally obvious ones and if you wait long enough they give you the answer. Total bullshit. \\n\\nOh so the restaurant itself I'm pretty sure is segregated. The hostess insisted that we sit at the bar even though the front dining area had plenty of tables open because she said there were only two waitresses for that area and they were already busy. So we walked through there and pretty much everybody was black. The bar had some people in it and (you should expect this if you've been reading carefully) they were all white. Probably a total coincidence. I'm not really sure but I'd guess Yelp might frown upon such a nonchalant accusation of segregation.\\n\\nThe only other time I've been to a Buffalo Wild Wings was in high school when I went with my friend Katie and these twins, Greg and whatever the gay one's name was. All I remember from that was the twins were really hot and I had a thing for Greg and didn't find out until January when I visited Katie in Brooklyn that a) Greg is her roommate now and b) he totally had a thing for me, too. So when we reunited we hella made out and I know my ex-boyfriend doesn't read this but if he does I might as well come clean about also making out with 3 other guys early on in our relationship because that's what you get when you date me for 5...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

We stayed in a pretty basic suite in the Casino Tower. It was just overall a pretty bad experience. \\n\\nCheck-in was easy and the guy at the front desk that helped me, James, was really friendly and helpful. When we went to check out on the tv, it said their system was down, but we called the front desk and they let us check out over the phone which was convenient. However, the room itself was not very clean when we got there. There was dust everywhere. it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned or stayed in in weeks, possibly months. There was even what looked like a blood stain on the curtains. \\n\\nThere are signs all over the casino and hotel that says \\\"\"no outside food or beverage allowed\\\"\" which is just plain ridiculous if they're going to charge you $8 for a bottle of water in the room. We still ended up bringing our own food and some drinks from home, but once we ran out of water, we were pretty much screwed. We ended up just drinking water from the sink. \\n\\nThe rooms here are not in any way shape or form soundproof. Once the concert was over and we had eaten, it was already about 2am. We were so tired, we just wanted a good nights rest. Not going to happen at this hotel. First of all, it is very close to the airport, so planes were flying right over us and it was SO LOUD. I know this isn't something the hotel can control, but it just shows how terrible of a location it's in. Also, in the room we had, the window was looking onto the rooftop of the casino and there were incredibly loud generators running all night that kept waking me up. We could hear people throughout the entire night walking and talking in the hallway. \\n\\nAlso, the location of this hotel is not amazing. This is a part of vegas that I would NEVER go to alone and I definitely would not recommend leaving the hotel if you decide to...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

This is a great place to come for a show or just to hang out and grab some food or drinks. There is always something awesome to check out here no matter what day of the week. Most of the shows do have some sort of cost, but it is usually worth the price. I have seen tons of shows here in the past and had a wonderful time. The venue is very personal and offers a wide array of options for you to enjoy the show, including lots of standing room, high table tops, and stadium blenchers in the back. Inside the venue there are conveniently located bathrooms, the merch table and a bar.\\n\\nDrinks - The bottled beer selection here is pretty decent but the draft selection of beers is very limited. I would recommend sticking to hard liquor here. The Vodka Sodas here are some of the best and strongest in town. After just three of these drinks you will be feeling very good. They also carry a personal favorite of mine, Templeton Rye whiskey. A glass on the rocks will run you $10, but it is well worth it.\\n\\nFood - I have heard many good things about the food from the Crescent, but I have only ever ordered the nachos.  These nachos are awesome though! They are delicious but expensive at ~$13. However, they can easily feed 2-4 people so the cost is not that bad unless you are the one treating the table. I am very interested in coming here during the day to try other food. Most of the menu is extremely affordable and sounds delicious, especially for a concert venue.\\n\\nStaff/Service - I have only been here at night, but it is pretty typical not to receive any sort of table service if you are at the front room or on the patio. I would recommend ordering all drinks and food up at the bar. The bar staff are super nice and work quickly to get everyone's order taken care of. If you are ordering food they will give you a card to bring back to your table so someone else can...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

We mostly just dunked the bread into the soup like it was fondue. So good. The meals came with a chocolate strawberry and bread which was tasty.  The brownie was super rich and my hubby who is a sweets-aholic could only eat a few bites. Same with the cake.

I do wish they had a build your own salad instead of just subbing things on their current menu without having to do extra $.50 charges for adding simple things like tomato or cucumber.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Two people joined our group at the last second, but I didn't think it would be a major problem to add a chair on either end of the table. I approached our server and apologized for the inconvenience, but asked if we could get two more chairs.\\n\\nI was met with a brisk, \\\"\"We don't really have any more chairs.\\\"\" It should be noted that without moving my head, I could see at least three vacant chairs and one or two lining the wall. Not everyone had arrived yet, however, so I didn't raise the issue again until they did. The server begrudgingly made another place setting before barking, \\\"\"Just sit down here, because if you move and the order gets screwed up, it's going to take me, like, fifteen minutes to fix.\\\"\"\\n\\nThis is also around the time that two of my guests mentioned that something was dripping on them. Indeed, the ceiling was dripping water. When they mentioned it to the server, he said, \\\"\"Oh, yeah. The air conditioning's over you and it leaks a bit. I was going to recommend you leave that chair vacant, but since you're already short on seats now...\\\"\"\\n\\nI was taken aback, partially because of his rude tone, and partially because I couldn't understand how someone would be so preternaturally stupid as to 1) put a chair under a leaking air conditioner and 2) expect that all seats in the reservation wouldn't be filled.\\n\\nOne of my guests did not receive her soda for forty minutes, and another guest did not receive one of her plates of sushi until just before we were about ready to leave.\\n\\nThe two stars above are for the chef, to whom I give my compliments. Everyone was thrilled with their appetizers and the sushi itself was very well-prepared. Compliments to the bar, as well. I had a delicious drink called, \\\"\"Keep Calm and Carry On.\\\"\" I would suggest the servers at this establishment take the drink's name as a piece of advice.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Like some other reviewers, I have never had a bad experience going for teppenyaki ... but, what a disaster.  \\n\\nSo, we made a reservation for 6pm, and when we made it, the person taking the call made it sound like they were so busy, with limited availability.  When we arrived, the restaurant was virtually empty, and with a scour (arriving at literally 6.01) the hostess snarled \\\"\"we've been waiting for you\\\"\".. \\n\\nGot to the table, at 6.02, and there were 2 other people waiting, I joked.. Sorry to keep you guys waiting.  They laughed, but the last laugh was on us, because there were another 6 people joining our table with a 6.15 reservation.  \\n\\nI ordered a drink, neat... when it arrived, there was a piece of something floating in the glass.  I very quietly asked the hostess/manager as I'm learning to replace the drink.  She took it back to the owner of the restaurant, and the chef, who inspected the glass, and discussed it.. then nothing.\\n\\nThe waiter came over around 10 minutes later (we were all wondering what was going on at the table.. there was a mix of frustration and silliness because of how disorganized the place was).. No apology, the waiter asked if I would like something else.. I said sure, how about the same in a clean glass?  (in a nice way).. \\n\\nAnyway, here is a summary of it all.. \\nFood was really a 1/5, \\n\\nTook 50 minutes just to see food coming to the table?  (this is cut up vegetables, and proportioned meat?)\\n\\n1.  my daughters chicken was placed on the grill frozen, and came like rubber.\\n2.  The salad was ripped out of a bag, with some sub par Japanese dresing\\n3.  The steak, was over cooked (even though we asked for it prepared rare\\n4.  The salmon was fishy, and lacked any real flavor other than old stale fish.\\n\\nBill comes, I was double charged for the drink, and the waiter out of his pocket took out the $5 saying he would have to pay.

What I do know is that we have been there many times and the one constant is the shiiiiiiiitttttty service. Here's an anecdote: \\n\\nThree friends and I went to Ten to get some sushi. We ordered sushi. My little deal is I like to order spicy tuna rolls but--get this--add avocado. Because avocado is good. The couple with me orders a spicy salmon roll, which ordinarily comes with avocado--except that they didn't want the avo. So, among other things, we should be receiving spicy tuna rolls *with* avocado and spicy salmon rolls *without* avocado. Backwards, yes. \\n\\nWell of course I wouldn't be writing this if that's what had arrived. No, alas, we got our rolls but sans modifiers, i.e. spicy salmon with and spicy tuna without avocado. So I politely pointed this out to the waiter. The appropriate response would be: O. M. G. I'm so sorry--be right back with the correct order. Nope. The waiter looks at the rolls and then goes to check with the sushi chef. He returns and tells us (!) that the rolls are actually correct: that salmon colored roll is indeed tuna, and the tuna colored roll is, in fact, salmon. When confronted with the issue of salmon colored ties (not to mention half of Craig Sager's wardrobe) being named after the wrong goddamned fish, the waiter could only muster a vacant stare and offered to talk to the manager. TALK TO THE MANAGER? \\n\\nSo the manager comes and reiterates: yes, that is indeed tuna. \\\"\"The one colored like salmon?\\\"\" Yes. \\\"\"And the tuna colored one?\\\"\" Salmon. Ah. \\\"\"Would it matter to you if I told you that I ate the 'tuna' roll and it tasted conspicuously salmony?\\\"\" No, that is indeed tuna. We add to our tuna (insert name of some made up, nonexistent spice that turns tuna salmon color and vice-versa) and that makes it look that way. \\n\\nNow I'm making this story drag, I admit.

The bar was full, a bit tough to get a bar but expected, and it seemed like a great time. We recently went there to watch the NCAA Football National Championship. I thought it'd be a nice place for a group of about 8 of us to watch it. The game wasn't on when we got there, and we mentioned we wanted to watch it and they sat us where we could see the game and then put the game on. There were a few tables of people in the bar with people, and all of us were interested in the game. However, they would not turn the sound on. We asked the waitress, and she spoke to the manage, and the returned to tell us sorry but she couldn't. We didn't really understand why, as everyone wanted to watch it, so we asked to talk to the manager. He came over and said his boss wouldn't let him do it, but he'd be happy to send this person over. Ok, we'll keep doing this, we thought. Yes, please send him over. Well that person never arrived. We waited and waited for about 20-30 min for the person to give us a reason why they wouldn't turn the sound on for a game that everyone was watching. We got fed up and walked over to the Steak and Lube that had the game on with sound and a lot of people watching it. I do not think I'll be heading back to the Nitty Gritty (unless it's before a hockey game) anytime soon.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I think of burger-medium well as \\\"\"no pink in the middle,\\\"\" or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than, say, a beef steak.  Many restaurants will not even have a medium-rare burger as an option owing to the chance of food poisoning from undercooked hamburgers.

He pressed the service button on the neighboring machine because the service button on the frozen machine wasn't functioning.

He agreed and said he would track it down and call back with an explanation and return it to us.

I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \\n\\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \\n\\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. \\n\\nI had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad. \\n\\nI am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

After walking in to the no-frills and being ignored for a bit, I was ready to walk out.  I'm glad I changed my mind.\\n\\nYes the service can be a bit slow and some times appear surely, and the decor is bare bones... but this is because they are dedicated to putting all their energy into producing the finest bbq this side of the Kansas. One can imagine places like this spread out through along the highways and small towns in the mid-west and southern states, packed with BBQ loving locals.  Once you get to the counter and get down to the business of placing your order, the service is extremely friendly and helpful (especially for a Canadian transplant, who didn't know the first thing about real BBQ culture)\\n\\nAfter getting my order home, all I could say is FAN-TAS-TIC. Smoky, tender pork ribs slathered in an amazing barbecue sauce --  sweet, with a deep yet subtle 'tang'. Frankly, I don't remember what sides I ordered, as i was lost in the meat, saucy goodness.\\n\\nOverall, a great experience, and while I've yet to return, I will be back one of these days.  After having tried Stacy's, all I can say is I'm a BBQ convert.  Since that fateful day, I've been busy checking out other BBQ joints as well as perfecting my own sauces and techniques (which has given me a deeper appreciation for the mastery of what Stacey and his staff do).

I struggled a little bit on whether to give them three or four stars (3.5 would have been perfect score but yelp doesn't do halves) but since everyone involved seemed to really enjoy themselves I couldn't help to give them the benefit of the doubt. It was very well organized and despite not being able to pick up my packet early (I live in Rock Hill, too far to drive to Concord twice) picking it up the day of the race was simple\\\\easy ($5 charge was a little too capitalistic for my taste but still cheaper than the gas I would have spent driving to packet pick up) The cost to run this 5k is a little pricey considering all you get is a cotton tshirt and a race bib but I didn't feel like it was a rip-off because I did feel like I was on a real life game show and that's not an easy thing to produce. The start music was great and the obstacles are designed to be fun yet some where slightly challenging. The gorilla bars, the get up and over and even getting up most of the slides requires some upper body and leg strength. The moon bounce, foam slide and tarzan swing were more pure entertainment. The wrecking ball, jumpy balls (darn near impossible to do) and sweeper were the only obstacles that had any real element of danger\\\\failure to them. Cool running's was by far the fan favorite as people kept going back to repeat it (going down a slide on a inner tube)  The tire mile was really pointless afterthought that could be taken out for something the better. The big slide at the end was fun too but by then I was almost tired of the slides. I think they could have taken out the drop and tire mile for the tight rope transverse and the aqua drag (other obstacles they have done in other cities but didn't do in Charlotte as they only pick 12) and that would have added enough variety to keep it from feeling redundant. The end felt sort of anticlimactic as there was no celebration afterwards outside of the foam photo place...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I like that they have so many options - seriously, you'll burn some of the calories just walking back and forth, searching for your table because you were too hungry to remember as you dashed to the seafood station. The taco station is a nice visit if you're interested in making your own tacos, hard shell and all.\\n\\nThe dessert station, which I used to be quite fond of, is now mediocre. It's like everything is just tossed together - no flavor. Just loaded with sugar and HFCS. The gelato is good, but I would say that about many other buffets serving gelato.\\n\\nYes, the lines are long. I never had a problem in the past because for the most part, I went through the Diamond line. And the few times I waited in the regular line, it was at odd times, so I barely waited. The wait isn't an issue - that's bound to happen at many other popular buffets.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Super disappointed.\\n\\nI was here three years ago, for my birthday, and remember it being  A LOT better.\\nWe made a reservation online, and were seated quickly...it was our anniversary, and like I said, I hadn't been there in 3 years, and my guy had never been there.\\n\\nFirst off, I know it's minor, but it is very dimly lit in there... So, factor that in with the noise factor, and you can barely recognize what you are being offered/served. We arrived during 'Happy hour'....that is only offered in the bar. Can't really enjoy that with a child, can we? But our waitress, who didn't offer her name, nor had a name tag told us that she \\\"\"wouldn't mind if we went to the bar to get a drink.\\\"\"\\n\\nOh, how gracious of you.\\n\\nI saw that they had a coconut mandarin mojito, that didn't sound very appetizing to me, so I asked if there was a way to do a pineapple one. The waitress said that would be no problem. The $12 mojito should be left to the Cuban Cuisine  at Havana Grill......Sorry, Brazil.\\n\\nWords can't describe the taste... Barely any pineapple, I felt like it was over poured, or mixed wrong....I guess that's what I get for asking for a custom drink.\\n\\nThe salad bar was probably the highlight. The little circles hardly mean anything to the servers. After we had decided that some of the meat was either salty, or too tough, we had flipped all three of the circles provided to red. However, we were constantly interrupted by servers. At least 6 times.\\n\\nThe best meat that we had was the bacon wrapped chicken. It was moist, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned..and the lamb chop...even though it was gamey-er than any other lamb that I have ever had...Everything else was just kind of a miss. My guy stopped eating a lot earlier than I did, he said that he was feeling funny....\\n\\nWell, that funny feeling had hit BOTH of us by the time we got home. We felt severely nauseated....I have never felt this way so quickly after eating food.\\n\\nNeedless to say, $120 (before tip, with 1 drink), is way too much for us to pay...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I wasn't too impressed with any of them maybe the ramen then the grilled chicken wings.  I don't know what it was with our choices but everything seemed to have a strong sour after taste.  Like after drinking a shot of vinegar.  Even the ramen had something sour in it which kind of threw our flavor palette into thinking why does all of our food taste sour or have a sour ingredient in it.  The prices for the food was the normal strip price, but the amount and quality and quantity u want for the money u are paying for, eh, it's just not worth it for me.  Oh we tried the soft serve dessert and yep there was some kind of ingredient in there that they added as a sprinkle the made it sour too the soft serve was a expresso flavor, we didn't know what to make of it.  We see the concept and seems really interesting. The menu has interesting fusions and ingredients used.

The shelf for the sale item my mom was looking for was empty. So we asked an employee if they could check to see if there was any in the back. It looked like they were restocking at the time so the chances seemed good that there might be. We asked the first employee we saw and he pushed us off to another employee. She seemed annoyed by our presense but asked what we were looking for and said she would go look. She must have then pushed us off to someone else because about 5 minutes later some guy we hadn't seen before walked up and asked if we were looking for something as the girl we had previously talked to walked by. So we told him what we were looking for. He disappeared for quite a while. When we finally did see him again he seemed to be chatting and socializing with another worker. After watching that for a few minutes it was clear he was just hanging out and not looking for our item so we decided to buy the couple things we had and leave. Mom decided she would stop at another Fry's since getting help at this one was going nowhere. On our way out the last guy that helped us (I use that term very loosely) saw us and said they didn't have what we were looking for and that he tried to find us. Well we didn't feel like waiting unitl he was done with his social conversation. It's hard to believe they had so many employees working but we couldn't get a simple answer if they had one product in stock after waiiting about 15 minutes. \\n\\nNext time I will make sure I just go to my regular Fry's, even if it is slightly out of the way.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Service is as bad as ever, which I used to be happy to overlook because the food and coffee were so great. Now the soups are being over-seasoned with heavy handed doses of curry powder, dill, and what tastes like artificial smoke flavoring, but ironically lack salt and pepper.  The vegetables and legumes are also usually undercooked (we're talking crunchy peas) while the pasta is overcooked and mushy. Their soups used to consistently wow me, but I can't remember the last time I had one that was even passable. Sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you end up with things like half inch thick cucumber slices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich. Portion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness, and the cup of soup for (i believe) $3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.   Prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.  Today I spent over $12 on a half sandwich/soup combo with which I was given very little soup, a pastry, and a bottle of water that they didn't actually ever give me.  It was pretty much the nail in the coffin for my Paradiso lunch habit.\\n\\nParadiso, please take note!

The chain had provided me with a \\\"\"25% off entire bill\\\"\" online coupon, so I decided to use it.  This saved me over $12.\\n\\nWe began with Asian Dumplings as an appetizer.  These chicken-filled potstickers were described as steamed but were actually pan fried, which I prefer.  Covered in black sesame seeds, they were cooked just right, very tasty, and comparable to T.G.I. Friday's potstickers, which I also happen to like.  However, instead of being accompanied by a Szechwan Dipping Sauce, these potstickers were served with a slightly spicy but smooth and tasty Peanut Sauce.  Only a little sauce was smeared on the platter, so I asked for and received an ample supply of additional Peanut Sauce.\\n\\nOur fine beginning was followed by a trip to the Garden Salad Bar, just $2.99 for unlimited salad bar visits added to the cost of an entree.  The salad bar was all I hoped it to be, with good red tomatoes, hot red onions, yummy egg, fine homemade skin-on potato salad, and a wide variety of ingredients and available dressings.  The only missing item I would have liked to have seen was garbanzo beans.  \\n\\nThe only disappointment of the night was the Chicken Harvest Soup.  This unusual looking soup consisting of reddish pieces of chicken, carrot bits, peas, and pasta, and served in a rectangular dish, was not very hot, and both its flat and spiral noodles were mushy and clearly overcooked.  The soup still had a good tomatoey flavor though.\\n\\nThe Seafood Festival is on, and my Shellfish Trio exceeded expectations.  For its diminutive size, the broiled Lobster Tail was one of the best I have tasted.  The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake was also quite tasty, and so were the three grilled Shrimps, except they were more medium to large than jumbo-sized as billed, and one was a bit undercooked.  The Garlic Scampi Butter enhanced the taste of all of these crustaceans.  The sliced tomatoes I ordered as a side were good but I discovered that...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

We stayed in a pretty basic suite in the Casino Tower. It was just overall a pretty bad experience. \\n\\nCheck-in was easy and the guy at the front desk that helped me, James, was really friendly and helpful. When we went to check out on the tv, it said their system was down, but we called the front desk and they let us check out over the phone which was convenient. However, the room itself was not very clean when we got there. There was dust everywhere. it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned or stayed in in weeks, possibly months. There was even what looked like a blood stain on the curtains. \\n\\nThere are signs all over the casino and hotel that says \\\"\"no outside food or beverage allowed\\\"\" which is just plain ridiculous if they're going to charge you $8 for a bottle of water in the room. We still ended up bringing our own food and some drinks from home, but once we ran out of water, we were pretty much screwed. We ended up just drinking water from the sink. \\n\\nThe rooms here are not in any way shape or form soundproof. Once the concert was over and we had eaten, it was already about 2am. We were so tired, we just wanted a good nights rest. Not going to happen at this hotel. First of all, it is very close to the airport, so planes were flying right over us and it was SO LOUD. I know this isn't something the hotel can control, but it just shows how terrible of a location it's in. Also, in the room we had, the window was looking onto the rooftop of the casino and there were incredibly loud generators running all night that kept waking me up. We could hear people throughout the entire night walking and talking in the hallway. \\n\\nAlso, the location of this hotel is not amazing.

The sides of sticky rice that came with my dining companions entrees were very good. The roll sushi was good (cali roll, sunrise mix roll), but not unlike any other roll I've had. The portions are large, if that matters to you. The fried chicken that comes with the meal is decent, but nothing special.\\n\\nThe negatives (which far outweighed the positives on this occasion) The miso soup was incredibly fishy in the bad way, they use a fish broth that tastes like it's been sitting around or something. \\n\\nThree of my dining companions ordered the tempura (2 chicken, 1 veggie)  The dishes are very bland, no seasoning whatsoever. The texture itself is enjoyable, but you must rely on the accompanying teryaki sauce to get any flavor whatsoever. One guy in our party got the beef teryaki which looked good, and he confirmed this, but I did not try it.\\n\\nProbably the most dissapointing part of my meal was the part I was expecting to be the best - the nigiri pieces. I ordered uni (sea urchin) ika (squid) fluke fin, anago, and toro. \\n\\nI'm not really an uni fan, but this didn't appear to be fresh. Fluke fin is a muscle, so one would expect it to be tough at most sushi places but I was hoping for better from chaya (as an aside, umi managed to make it incredibly delicate) the squid was tougher than I would have liked. The anago was fine, but nothing special. Worst of all - the toro was a bit tough. To my understanding toro should never be tough.\\n\\nI'm hoping I just caught them on an off night. I do plan to give chaya a second chance as so many rave reviews make me hope that they truly can provide a great meal.

The bread was perfect hot, fresh, crispy outside, and great bread. They place they feel short for me.

The seating is arranged so that it is not so \\\"\"Cafeteria style\\\"\". IDK if thats so much of a positive but that is the best I could do. \\n\\nThe food is bland, not seasoned well. Plain boring \\\"\"Comforter food\\\"\". Waaaaaaaay over priced for the food they provide. I paid $38 for the all you can eat day pass, but will NEVER do that again. It is NOT a deal if you don't like the food and don't eat it. I tried a little bit of everything (My buffet ritual) But I literally took one bite and put it down and moved to the next. I honestly don't remember taking more than one bite of anything. It was gross.  I went to McDonald's an hour later and had the best meal I had that day. And I don't even eat McDonald's. Ok so perhaps I'm being a little harsh....but to be honest, you can pay that same exact price to eat at the Wicked Spoon (BEST BUFFET ON THE STRIP, Don't believe yelp it)  anyways like I was saying, you can pay the same price, and eat like a Queen or King until you are stuffed!! And you still will want to eat because EVERYTHING is so tasty, you'll be so stuffed you won't need to eat for the rest of the day. ( At least that is what happened to me on several occasions) There fore, you are pretty much paying the same price for the days worth of food, but with a better experience. \\\\\\n\\nBut bottom line, even if I were to get a free pass for this buffet, I would probably try to sell it to a foolish person for $5, take that and go put it in a slot machine.

Tammie was amazing had a great smile always and tried to upgrade us but in a casual way where I didn't feel pressure we asked her opinion on dessert and she gave it to us.she asked us for refills and was very on top of her service.

These people are a chain style BBQ joint that is meant to cater to people just wanting to eat out, not anyone looking for good Q. \\n\\nThe brisket only has flavor on one edge. They don't prep it so the flavor goes throughout the meat and it sits there precut so it can dry out while it's waiting on you to order it. That's a basic failure in serving this type of food. The sausage is store bought and sits around in a stack waiting for you to order it. \\n\\nThe sides are basic. Dried corn on the cob, macaroni and cheese with processed cheese (think Kraft with premade \\\"\"cheese\\\"\" in the box with an aftertaste) and the baked beans taste like canned beans with pepper added. The cornbread is God-awful. It's almost as dense as iron and has a really bad taste. \\n\\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Even the Arizona Dickie's style BBQ joint is better than this. That, and there is a Ruby's literally just across the street.

My sushi roll didn't have too much rice and was rolled very well, as it didn't fall apart. Yellowtail and jalapeno were as plentiful as much as a roll could fit.

The fish was in shapes that were too perfect to be fresh.  I immediately thought that the fish must come off the back of a food truck.  We agreed the slaw was nasty.  Neither of us could identify what the seasoning was, but it was pretty awful.\\n\\nThe kale salad, although large and the kale a beautiful green, was undressed.  Thankfully the ingredients were tasty enough that it really did not need dressing, and without having been coated in dressing the leftovers were fresh the next day.\\n\\nWe didn't try any beer but the beer list was impressive.

I order the house margarita to go along with it and it was delicious. Served in a cute mason jar and was pretty strong for being on happy hour special.

Before even talking about wine, the customer service focus is amazing. From all the Bridal Shows my fiance and I have been to, they are always so accommodating as far as costs for event rental and the way the owner handles business is great. I am currently in charge of our wedding rehearsal dinner/party, and this is the #1 spot I have set on my list. If we go through with it, it will be a blast. \\n\\n*As for our experience at the bar........*\\n\\nMy fiance and I went here on a Groupon about a year and a half ago. We haven't been back since. Its not our fault though, we've just been so busy.....sigh... Even without the Groupon, I would come by here, and we are planning on doing so shortly.  The wine tasting was great, and the platter we tried really added to wine pairing. Being a semi-wino, I enjoyed trying the varieties, while my fiance went right for the desert wines. Its nice to know they make in-house such a wide variety of wines for everyone to try,. \\n\\nConsidering the wines they make are privately made, and not \\\"\"mass-produced\\\"\", the bottled wine to be purchased is also quite reasonable. The staff is friendly, and the ambiance of the location lends to a relaxing chill mood, rather than a fast paced guzzle-fest or a upper class snooty wine bar. We were able to play some fun board games while sipping on wines, and we stayed for a good couple hours just taking the location in and playing games. I can't wait to come back!!!!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

My husband, a fan of soul food, ordered pig knuckles and had to gnaw on a nearly meatless bone for his dinner. I sent back my meal and filled up on diet soda and the delicious putos. But we actually left hungrier than when we arrived and grabbed a Little Caeser's pizza because after spending $28 on a non-dinner (including tip because it wasn't the waitress' fault), our budget for dinner was deflated. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE a variety of Asian foods and I enjoy trying new things.

I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious. \\n\\nToday I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts. \\n\\nI am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.  \\n\\nThis time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback.

What I do know is that we have been there many times and the one constant is the shiiiiiiiitttttty service. Here's an anecdote: \\n\\nThree friends and I went to Ten to get some sushi. We ordered sushi. My little deal is I like to order spicy tuna rolls but--get this--add avocado. Because avocado is good. The couple with me orders a spicy salmon roll, which ordinarily comes with avocado--except that they didn't want the avo. So, among other things, we should be receiving spicy tuna rolls *with* avocado and spicy salmon rolls *without* avocado. Backwards, yes. \\n\\nWell of course I wouldn't be writing this if that's what had arrived. No, alas, we got our rolls but sans modifiers, i.e. spicy salmon with and spicy tuna without avocado. So I politely pointed this out to the waiter. The appropriate response would be: O. M. G. I'm so sorry--be right back with the correct order. Nope. The waiter looks at the rolls and then goes to check with the sushi chef. He returns and tells us (!) that the rolls are actually correct: that salmon colored roll is indeed tuna, and the tuna colored roll is, in fact, salmon. When confronted with the issue of salmon colored ties (not to mention half of Craig Sager's wardrobe) being named after the wrong goddamned fish, the waiter could only muster a vacant stare and offered to talk to the manager. TALK TO THE MANAGER? \\n\\nSo the manager comes and reiterates: yes, that is indeed tuna. \\\"\"The one colored like salmon?\\\"\" Yes. \\\"\"And the tuna colored one?\\\"\" Salmon. Ah. \\\"\"Would it matter to you if I told you that I ate the 'tuna' roll and it tasted conspicuously salmony?\\\"\" No, that is indeed tuna. We add to our tuna (insert name of some made up, nonexistent spice that turns tuna salmon color and vice-versa) and that makes it look that way. \\n\\nNow I'm making this story drag, I admit.

We asked about Saturday delivery and she had no idea how that worked or what would happen to the package if it couldn't be delivered on Friday.  She wanted to talk about everything but shipping the package.  It was almost like she couldn't hear because she paid no attention to the questions we were asking.  We finally get a price and it is outrageous and she quotes a time different than what we filled out on the slip.  I came home and found a FedEx location very close to where we were trying to ship the package in about 60 seconds on the FedEx site.  We were quoted $160+ for overnight.  Per the FedEx site we got a quote for $110 using generous measurements.  We also got a quote for $77 for Saturday delivery which the store person couldn't even come close to figuring out.  Ultimately we took the package to UPS and shipped for Saturday delivery at $75, less than half of the only option the clerk could come up with.  I have shipped thousands of items with FedEx, UPS, USPS etc. and you do have to ask questions or you can be disappointed.  This gal clearly has not been trained and I don't have enough time to do their job for them.  We were there 30 minutes and finally left because we couldn't get anywhere.

He stated he would not comp the meal because the \\\"\"cut was not that big\\\"\" despite the blood soaked napkin my friend had on the table that suggested otherwise. He was unable to define how large the cut needed to be before he was willing to pay for the meal. He then began arguing with my friend as she was upset with the way he handled the situation. This place may have decent food, but this by far was MY WORST EXPERIENCE IN VEGAS!!!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I currently use Benefit spray, which is awesome but I also wanted to see if I could get a cheaper brand. Well, we weren't greeted when we walked in, but then again it was pretty busy, so I let that slide. But as I was looking around, trying to find where their fix sprays were, one associate walked right by me, (maybe like a foot away from me) and didn't ask if I needed help, and pretended like she was busy with a basket of items in her hand. Not wanting to bother her, I looked around for other help, but no one except the girls at the hair section seemed available. We wander around aimlessly for about 20 minutes, until  my boyfriend  found an associate who was standing in the front middle section of the store, writing something on a piece of paper. As I walked up to her, I asked her, \\\"\"Excuse me?\\\"\" and in the rudest tone ever and without looking up, she says, \\\"\"YES?\\\"\" I was shocked by her rudeness, but I went ahead and asked her for help anyway. She then looks up at me with the most irritated look on her face and says something along the lines of, \\\"\"I'm not on the clock right now so I'm gonna have to get someone else to help you.\\\"\" She then yells loudly across the whole store to this young man and told him to show us the Urban Decay brand of fix sprays. Though this guy was nice, I wasn't too happy when I asked him if there was another brand of spray that is a bit cheaper and he says, \\\"\"Oh, we don't carry any other brand, this is the only one we have. Plus, it's the best one we have and I wouldn't recommend anything else.\\\"\" After I thanked him and he left, I saw the Benefit product section, went over and saw that they had a bottle of fix spray that was cheaper than Urban Decay. I was irritated that he said they didn't carry anything else when clearly they did and was costing less. Seeing as how my temper was getting bad and I didn't want to stay in the store any longer, I got in...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I have no qualms in saying that the Bone In Ribeye (my staple!) at Maestro's was the best out of all of them!  The steak literally could have doubled as a dessert - it almost had a brown sugar taste to the outer crust while the perfectly cooked medium rare center oozed out delicious juices to mix with my Maestro's Potatos (a highly recommended side that is much more affordable then the Lobster mashed potatoes which I decided to pass on after reading yelp reviews)\\n\\nThe wife had a filet which was cooked to her liking (but not mine since it was medium well, lol) which she also enjoyed.\\n\\nLast but not least, I didnt see much about this on Yelp, but do NOT pass up the warm butter cake for dessert.

For dessert, we got the strawberry cobbler & it was just the perfect touch of sweetness to end our dinner.\\nThe restaurant is more like a lounge, with   a slightly romantic ambiance, which i loved! Sadly, we had to go back to Canada, but like I always say \\\"\"C'est la vie!\\\"\" \\nI can't wait to come back!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

He said he would try it out to see how she acted around the other dogs & if it didn't work he would just be put her in a kennel after grooming until I picked her up. I show up at 9am Monday morning drove 25min from my house to get there & when I arrive its a woman working who asks a few questions and I tell her everything I did to the guy while making the appointment. She then has another guy come out to say they have no kennels (which I made an appointment) so I should come first or at least have been told to schedule for another time. But then starts saying since she's not fixed she can't be there anyway and then goes into talking about her temperament. Then asked if I was going to breed her & it would be in my best interest to breed her soon & get her fixed because she will cause problems in the future.

The fact that it's outdoors is good and bad, sometimes weather makes it a little difficult to shop (too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter).  I love the addition of the parking structure, though I think it seems like a far walk from the structure to the stores - but I'm all for more parking! Another great thing about the place is that on Black Friday, it seems that they keep opening earlier and earlier for serious shopper like myself!!\\n\\nI do think that they need to improve on their Food Court - there really isn't anything about it that stands out, but at least they have a Starbucks!!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Hipsters who act like they can not put down their phones yet are so concerned about saving the earth, check. While there is nothing wrong with the idea (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery) just how many of these places do we need?\\n\\nIn my opinion if you are going to copy something at least bring something new to the table when you do! This place does not meet that goal. In fact they manage to mess up some of the basic things that chipotle did right while charging you more at the same time. That is quite a feat to pull off lol. My order was for two burritos (one pork, green sauce, brown rice, cheese and the other shredded beef, cilantro lime rice, black beans and hot sauce). Both were a nice size (compared to chipotle) yet cost almost a full 2 dollars more! The pork had a nice spice but was to salty for me. The green verde sauce was ok but tasted of mostly tomatillos. It could have used something to balance it out like cumin, roasted poblanos, honey or even some more garlic. With drinks the total came out to something like 22.50 for two people! I can make this food at home for way less than that and still have money left for dessert. While it is nice to try eating somewhere new it is not worth almost $25 and 110 plus degree days just to eat here again. Good for some but for me No Bueno!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

The first time we dined here it was by chance; we were hungry and we're just cruising Lake Mead Blvd looking for a place to eat.

The server was friendly and the sushi chefs too.\\n\\nWe had the same server and she is very friendly and nice.  Now, here is where it all goes awry.  We order a couple of hand rolls, it was good.

I look at it and it does not look like yellowtail.  I take one small bite and I can barely bit into it.  On top of that he tried to add something to the fish to make it more edible.  I still don't know what it was.\\n\\n My man comes back from the bathroom and I look at him and he says \\\"\"what is that?\\\"\"  I said, \\\"\"supposedly yellowtail\\\"\".  My man takes a bite, looks at the sushi chef and says \\\"\"Yellowtail??\\\"\"  He only said one word with a question in his voice and the sushi chef immediately says, \\\"\"oh so sorry I give you better piece, I accidentally give you piece that was bleeding\\\"\".  What???  I have been eating sashimi for 15 years now, my man a little longer.  We know good sashimi.  He tried to pull one over on us and I felt really insulted.  He shouldn't be serving that to anyone, even if they hadn't known the difference.\\n\\nShame on you owner and sushi chef! (slap on the hand)  I thought I had found a great place to have sushi in town, now I will have to resume my search.  I never mess around with raw fish, all it takes is one bad experience for me to scrap a place.  Your place is officially scrapped Sir!

Our waiter was very nice and friendly. She was attentive to when we needed drink refills and took it upon herself to give us refills before we had to ask. I had the stromboli and my coworker had the chicken fingers. Not the best stromboli I've ever had (that honor goes to Four Kegs), but it was really good. The portion size was good, and came with a side of marinara for dipping. The chef also came out to ask us how the food was. I thought that was a nice touch.\\n\\nThe prices were fairly reasonable, but we used Groupon Now vouchers, so it ended up being a great deal.

Because of the bad reviews my boyfriend said no, but I insisted.  The quality of the food is not up to par, but the prices were high.  We sent 2 out of the 5 things back and were still charged for the drink that we did not drink and sent back because it tasted bad.  The Mac and cheese was undercooked and also sent back.  After some argument about whether or not it was undercooked or just \\\"\"al dente\\\"\" with the waitstaff we felt so awful we wanted to just get out of there.  I know the difference between the two and felt insulted that they argued with me. We left and looked at the bill on our way out-- Unfortunately we were overcharged on our meal as well and had to go back for a $3 refund which was super emabarrasing and I wish we had just left with our dignity at a $3 loss instead.  The manager never came out to apologize for us having such a bad meal or being overcharged.  Even at low end restaurants they would do that.  Very disappointing.  We won't return.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Wow, talk about walking into a place and instantly feeling welcome, warm, cozy and yummy. Now let it be said, right here and now, that the whole \\\"\"New Messico\\\"\" food is not really up my alley. Tex Mex, do they call it? Newp, not my thing at all, but good hearty comfort food on a chilly night always sounds good and so we ventured on over to Richardson's to see what they were cooking up.\\n\\nBut first...wine. (You can't order food without wine, duh.)\\n\\nSo, we ordered a tasty bottle of Chilean red (imagine that, me, order a spicy red, nooo!!) and as the four of us waited for our table we looked over the menu and read the many specials up on the boards. Fish seemed to be the hot dish of the night, but once I saw one of my favorite words....SCALLOPS...it was kind of a no brainer as to what I was gonna order.\\n\\nWe then were seated in a super cozy booth in the back and after the four of us devoured the pizza app we ordered it was time to order the main attractions. The boys had Chimayo chicken and the carne adovada and Gabi K and I tried the scallop appetizer and the special scallop pasta. Sadly this is where the review goes south...\\n\\nSALT. There's a reason you often hear the word \\\"\"pinch\\\"\" next to \\\"\"salt.\\\"\" If it's over done, yikes, it's just gross and their blackened coating is like a salt lick. Which was sucha  bummer, because those scallops were cooked to perfection, but after attempting to scrape off the blackening on 4 of them, I finally just gave up. Perhaps the way to go is to just ask for them grilled. I think they would be superb then, but stay away from the salty blackened option.\\n\\nOther than that minor thing, I really enjoyed our experience here. The waiter was a great sport considering we had two comedians with us and put up with all of our silliness. The only other thing was the check sitch. I guess they don't like to split a check more than 2 ways....\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Last Thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers, many Gold got off the bus to find their name not on the Gold sign, so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside (gold office too small for more than 3-4 people) to wait for ONE person to find us cars.  Finally after 20 mins a second person came to help  After a significant wait I was asked if I really needed a full-sized car as requested.  Since it was apparent something else would be quicker I took what they offered (of course smaller not more luxurious). The car was fine - however, the return experience on Friday afternoon was just as miserable - perhaps more so since I was now running late for my flight. \\n\\nFirst of all, CLT airport you need a traffic light at the intersection Near the  Hertz return entrance - it took about 15 mins to get across the street -thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross. \\n\\nAnd then, we waited another 15 mins for a bus to take us to the terminal - bad planning Hertz.

Unfortunately the food we tried (other than the house salad, which was fresh and good) was nothing special. The slaw on the BBQ platter was not very flavorful and the BBQ itself didn't have any kind of smoky appeal. The mac & cheese was OK but not great. As for the shrimp and grits, to me it was way too cheesy/greasy- some may like all the cheese but definitely too rich for my taste and not enough distinct grits flavor separate from the sauce/cheese. This would be a fun place to watch a game and definitely good for the drinking set.

I ordered my usual Mongolian beef dinner, order of Pork Fried Rice, and crab puffs and the lady who took my order can recite it from memory every time which is amazing.  So I trusted her to do the same in this instance and thought my order would arrive all good.   \\n\\nAfter my husband got the food from the driver and paid, we unpacked everything and his usual order of Pork Fried Rice was missing.  Turns out, the lady who took my order upgraded my plain fried rice in my entree to the Pork Fried Rice for a $2 upcharge and didn't correctly put in the entree order of the fried rice.  I immediately called the restuarant back as soon as the driver left to let them know and she explained the confusion and whatnot and said she would send the missing item ASAP.  \\n\\nDriver comes back within 20 mins and we got hit with an addition $7 charge for the Pork Fried Rice.  We paid it of course but since it was the restuarant's mistake, I was hoping for a small discount to even out the upgraded fried rice that I DID NOT WANT in my entree.  I ended up giving my fried rice to my husband so he could have an extra helping.  We have been cutting back on ordering out more and more over the years and this is something that will be definitely be cut out for good.  What a shame.  I liked them too.\\n\\n\\nOriginal: I was looking for a chinese delivery place that I haven't tried yet and I found this place through Yelp.  Because of the high reviews and that I am in its delivery range, I decided to order.\\n\\nIt was a Saturday night when I placed the order and a nice woman answered (it could've been the owner that other reviews mentioned) and I started asking her a bunch of questions about a couple dishes and she was patient and informative which helped me tremendously in deciding what I wanted and having a great...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

The entree ground beef Koobideh kababs were succulent and well-seasoned, and the Basmati rice and Zereshk Polo rice side dishes were amazing. Despite having to take most of our enormous portions away with us, we still found room for dessert and really enjoyed sharing the Persian ice cream - rich vanilla enhanced with saffron, rose water, and pistachio. What a delicious meal!\\n\\nOur server, Laura, was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly, and the interior decor was attractive, although we elected to sit outside.

We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us.  The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming.\\n\\nBuilt within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar.  Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that!  They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road.  The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black & white photos on the dark red walls.  If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows.  Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love \\\"\"seeing behind the curtain\\\"\" and watching the action.  I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space.\\n\\nThe menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty.  We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin ($6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread.  We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three.  For entrees I had the Portabella stew ($11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage ($14) and was also pleased.  Portions were fair sized, enough for dinner for each of us, not really enough to take home for lunch the next day.  Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta.  The greens were good, the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested.  \\n\\nThis is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta & asked for feedback, which we provided. ...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

After about 30 minutes, we noticed that the larger party who were seated much later than us, were getting their orders.  So we asked our server about our food and he told us it was because the kiddie burger was ordered well done and so it takes a little longer.  After another 30 minutes, we asked again and this time we were told it's because they are short handed.  Our food started coming one by one and each plate were cold.  My aunts fried catfish was cold and fries were cold and stale.  My tri-tip BBQ platter was cold, the cheesy grits was cold and so was the braised greens.  In fact, the braised greens was so cold that butter was clumping.  The well done kiddie burger was cold with stale fries.  We couldn't believe they even served it!!

The chunks wouldn't cook because they were too thick.. The chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked. I just couldn't eat the chicken at all. My companion ate it just so we wouldn't waste it, but he didn't like it either.

And it's more or less one note of flavor, as opposed to my favorite lunch spot in this area.\\n\\nThere were a couple other tables at times during the dinner, but it was pretty quiet during what would be the peak of dinner at more established places. And I was the only one there at my after peak-lunch stop.\\n\\nHaven't tried the sushi yet, so let's say this is only a review of half of the restaurant. There's some candy on the front counter that I haven't tried, and also a bento box and a \\\"\"specials\\\"\" board, so browse those if you try out Ninja.\\n\\nI'll give it a generous rounding up of 3.5 stars. It's a good lunch spot if you're in the area, nothing more.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Every year, we find ourselves driving across the bridge into San Diego in search of a crappy seafood dinner courtesy of Joe and his under-motivated teenage staff.  Every year, my meal both amazes and disappoints me.  How awful is a restaurant when it just keeps getting worse?  I am totally certain that the kitchen contains nothing but enormous bags of frozen seafood and deep-fryers the size of swimming pools.\\n\\nOne time, we had a waiter that kept calling all the men \\\"\"bro.\\\"\"  I am not your bro.  I am paying for and eating food that would get even a Red Lobster cook fired and, as such, am entitled to no less than five-star treatment.\\n\\nIf there is anything positive to say, it is that the bibs they hand out to people eating crab are HILARIOUS.  I've got the pictures to prove it.\\n\\nI'll visit the Shack once per year out of obligation.  I'll even be (sort of) happy to do it, considering those close to me seem to love it and I'm not going to rain on their parade.

There were 4 adults and 1 child in our party. For appetizers we ordered: Fried Clams and Hush Puppies. For dinner we ordered: Dungeness Crab (it was 2.5 pounds!),  Blue Crab, Clams and Shrimp and put it all in the middle of the table and shared. Since it was our first time we just went with the house seasoning on everything and ordered it mild. Absolutely everything was out of this world tasty and beyond our highest hopes! Super fresh! We had a hard time cracking our dungeness open and one of the servers came by and helped us with that. This is a messy, butcher paper on the table, noisy, family friendly, plastic bib provided, eating at a picnic table, throw your shells in a bucket, fresh-off-the-airplane-fresh-seafood restaurant. The food just shows up at your table once it is cooked; a server will come by with a plastic bag filled with your order and plunk it down. And for those of you parents out there - yes, they have chicken strips and fries and they were tasty according to our very picky 5 year old. We spent $147 with tax and a 20% tip, which we thought was very reasonable for all of the food that we stuffed ourselves on and the beer, wine and tea. There are a couple of sinks to use to hose yourself off when you are done which was very handy too! I am from the west coast and the other 3 adults were from the east coast, so we definitely are aware of what good seafood is (hence the blue crab vs. dungeness order) and we all place our seal of approval on this place!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

They were all delicious.  I wish they had onion or peppers to grill too, but not having it was no big deal to me.  The rice, niku-man, egg rolls, and sweet and sour chicken were great too.

Instead of accommodating us, he turned to the gentleman that had just walked up and said, is it okay if I take them.  The man did not answer.  So the attendant told us 'no'.  I walked back to the center and continued waiting.  If this wasn't bad enough, the two attendants working directly in front of us just walked off without telling us they were going somewhere.

How is that possible. So we told him, he is trying to explain us how we were wrong and he was right . After a few minutes,he realized it didn't add up. He said I'm not good at Maths!!!

I asked the hostess if I could take a look first and was surprised at the size and selection.  I definitely had to give it try after that.  For that price, it certainly beat anything I saw in their food court.  No comparison.\\n\\nIt obviously didn't hold a candle to my all-time favorite buffets on the strip at the Wynn and Bellagio, but for the price, it wasn't bad at all.  It wasn't celestial like the two that I just mentioned, but overall, I thought it was pretty good.\\n\\nThe waitperson I had was great and I noticed a nice little menu book of drinks with $2 on the cover.  She confirmed that all alcoholic drinks from that book were only $2.00 each!  I looked through the whole book (quite a selection) and saw that they not only had beer and wine, but also real cocktails for the same price.  The wines listed were Barefoot Cellars so I passed on that (but thought the price to be highly reasonable) and ended up having a Skyy vodka Cosmopolitan and also a Stoli Blue Lemonade.  The portions were generous and there was definitely alcohol in there.  Amazing for the price!\\n\\nDuring the feeding frenzy, I recall the following on my plate...sushi, spaghetti and meatballs, fried chicken, turkey, roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, pizza, carnitas, spring rolls, chicken soup, and lord knows what else that I just can't remember.  And yes, I only took a little of each, but even then...yikes.\\n\\nFar from the strip, so certainly not worth a special trip, but if I'm in the area, I'd definitely do the lunch buffet here again.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

When I went into the store they didn't even ask me my name.  They saw I had a kitten (was only able to catch one of my kittens, the other wouldn't leave the house that day) and immediately took care of her.  Obviously it's mostly dogs, and as the guy said on the phone, if there is a cat in there they will do them first because they don't want the cats stressing out.  Love that!  So I got Zoey's claws trimmed, and to my dismay, she was being a lot easier on this professional!  I felt betrayed, Zoey is always giving me a hard time when I clip her claws.  Then I asked about the teeth brushing (this is where 5 stars goes to 4) and the lady said that cats don't need their teeth brushed because the foam doesn't work the same way it would for dogs.  Now, this is the first time I've ever heard this.  I've even looked it up before and from most of my reading it says cats should get their teeth brushed (some even say as often as humans).  Maybe that's her opinion, and while I would've preferred her to just brush them anyway, she just gave her some breath-spray instead.  Which is fine.  The customer service I received was great, but it still is confusing to me how the guy on the phone allowed me to scheduled a teeth cleaning but when I go in there, this lady tells me they don't do that for cats.  Hmm.  Just a bit of some confusion there.  Anyway, it was 5 dollars to get the claws trimmed and I was in and out in 5 minutes as well, overall great experience!  All the grooming seems to be done out in the open, which is really good to see, they shouldn't have anything to hide.  Everyone else in there was friendly.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

My Husband and I stayed at the Westin after our wedding and it holds centimental value for us, so when we were in need of a spa day recently the Westin was our first choice.  We booked the Travelzoo massage in advance and were greeted promptly upon our arrival.  Everything seemed to go well with check-in and we were shown to our respective locker rooms.  I didn't find the actual facilities to be anything special.  It had all the basic things and seemed a-ok.  Honestly, I don't even remember it well and that was less than a month ago.\\n\\nNow, the massage.  I have to say this in one of, if not the worst, massages I have ever had.  I asked for \\\"\"medium\\\"\" pressure and got the massage of my nightmares.  She was so aggressive I thought I was going to be pushed right through the table.  It was awful, painful, and the complete opposite of relaxing. I spent most of the time wondering when it will be over.  I thought to myself this must be an annomoly, but NO, my Husband had the exact same experience.  He even asked his massuse to let up, but she didn't.  We both walked away more than disappointed.  Afterwards we hung out by the spa pool, which was nice and quiet compared to the main pool area.  Service was OK... honestly the best part of the whole day was the boneless buffalo wings and bannana smoothie.  Those were to die for.\\n\\nUpon reflection, I realized we never got our mimosa or foot massage as part of the Travelzoo package.  Just another disappointment, but I didn't even care to bring it to anyone's attention.  I really enjoy hitting up local spas during the summer and thanks to Travelzoo I usually get them at a good price for the quality.  This time, anything over $1 was too much for this spa experience.  To say we were disappointed is the understatement of the year.  We won't be back.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Told me I had to bring my bike in cold so they could do the adjustment.  So i loaded it up in my truck the night before drove it there and dropped it off. Day later I get a call bike is done but they tried starting it and it wouldn't  idle/run and was pouring out black smoke,  not exactly what you want to hear after you drop off your perfectly running bike.   They asked if they could look into the problem more I said yes so they disconnected my power commander and found out that was the cause of the problem.  $325 Being hard to believe seeing how its less than a year old and was working just fine the day before.   When I went into the shop to pick up the bike they said they would hook back up the power commander and show me the problem. They started it up for me and long behold it was running just fine just like before.   So I have no clue what were they trying to do if they were trying to scam me into buying a new power commander and also charging me for them to look or a problem that never was their.  I have a feeling they hooked something up wrong the first time and correctly the second but do you think they would knock off some money off my $550 dollar bill nope this shop was very unprofessional and I would advise you to stay away from this shop.  Lesson learned.   Also when I brought my bike back home I noticed an air box screw stripped as well as the case cover bolt.

I gave her my cc # and she said she would take care of it. 3 days later no refund, nor a peep from anyone at Ashley Furniture. Today after making multiple calls I find that it will now take 2-7 business days to process my refund, a very important tidbit of info the CSR neglected to tell me. I also needed to confirm the delivery date for my remaining item, but since the CSR only sent me a message through another rep and didn't call me herself, I wasn't able to confirm the delivery and had to call back yet a 3rd time. \\n\\nI work in sales and deal with customers every day. Though the sales experience was good, the follow up and lack of customer service negates the great service I received on the front end of the transaction. If a refund is due, the customer should be given a time line right then in which to expect the transaction completed and not have to hunt down the CSR for answers...3 days later. I won't be ordering anything else from Ashley Furniture again and though I'd like to put the rep on blast, I will refrain from doing so as that doesn't fix the situation. \\n\\nFinal thoughts...it's equally important to pay attention to your customers AFTER the sale as it is during...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I called them and was told they did not do unlimited water and I spent an hour on the phone with them and finally settled for 16 bottles of water a month for a similar cost.  Again after a while went by they began taking bottles and not replacing all the ones left out.  When I called them this time I was told the account manager had changed our water amount based on our usage.  I again reminded them that we were also using the water for water storage purposes (and by the way they did not reduce our monthly bill).  We went back and forth and finally I was told the account manager would call me back.  This never happened and I have been working on an alternate solution since.\\n\\nFunny thing although they didn't honor the orginal O Premium agreement nor their verbal contract with me they wanted to take back the water cooler (which is about 10 years old and was paid in full 5 years ago) and to charge me the $52 cancellation fee that O Premium had in their contract.

Although there were quite a few places to sit and a near empty bar, it took several minutes to be greeted by a hostess, two of them were too busy talking to each other to acknowledge us. We were eventually seated and the service was lackluster. We ordered our food and when it came one of the dishes was incorrect. OK, stuff happens, but when my friend told the waiter her order was wrong, he argued with her, saying he remembered distinctly what she ordered. But he was wrong. He hadn't written the order down and was simply wrong. He huffed and took the plate back, remarking once again that she had ordered it. The rest of us were served, and eventually she was brought her food by a different server. He said, \\\"\"Lucky for you we weren't too busy or you would have had to wait a lot longer.\\\"\" That did it. We won't be back, and it's too bad. The food and the drinks are good. I tipped 18% on the $84.00 bill, but I shouldn't have. There are too many fine choices in Old Town. I expect to be treated with some modicum of respect.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I love the dresses, but a hundy on a dress will have to wait til I get a raise (boo salary freeze/recession). However, the jackets were incredibly reasonably priced, around $100-150 and again, very cut.

Picked up a five-piece, simple silver toned ring for $6 - yeah, you heard me, $6 - and I get compliments on it all the time. Also picked up a nice little silver feather necklace for the sister for xmas and she loved it. The sis had seen one at U.O. or something for like $29, but I got her the one every girl at HH *won't* have for $18. AND, i can say about the men's selection is that I LOVE the hand-screen-printed (can you hand screen print? Does that makes sense) ties ($30)! In bright jewel tones like peacock blue, hot pink and lime green, with awesome prints like an octopus ... or a bicycle. Bought one for the BF for xmas and gave it to him early so he could wear it at his friend's xmas party and it was a hit! Very unique and incredibly stylish - and I'm a winner cause I'm the cool ass GF that got it for him. \\nEverybody wins!!!\\nI was going to give four stars, but how cool is shopping before hh at the Roosevelt?

In July someone slit my tire in front of my home and I had to take my car to this location from Buckeye to get a new tire bc this was where I purchased the tire originally. I had to bring it back 2x before they actually got the tire in. IT was a big ordeal to get my tire, which if you are a tire place and you sold me that tire, shouldnt you have stock??? My car has been vibrating since March (which is before July) and when I just took my car in to get this problem fixed, I was notified that I need to purchase all new tires... now wouldnt Fletchers have seen the tires in July and said something was not right and needed to be corrected. Now  5 months later I have to pay for 2 new tires because Fletchers did not look at my tires, which is odd because they balanced and rotated after they put on the new tires. After these warranties expire, I will never again purchase tires from Fletchers. I am so upset and irritated on the poor service.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

And I was definitely impressed. La Cave, known for their small plates, flatbreads and extensive wine list, was simply amazing! I dined with 2 colleagues and ordered 5 plates, which was more than enough to share. I will review in the order we received our food, starting with the mushroom grits which were to die for! I don't believe I had ever had grits before and my first experience eating them was amazing. The grits are served with the mushrooms, pecorino cheese and butter on top and after mixing everything in, each bite I took was absolutely delicious. Next up was the salt-roasted beets, topped with goat cheese and pistachios. Every beet salad I've had in the past is usually served cold, whereas the beets I enjoyed at La Cave were warm and fresh. Shortly thereafter came the bacon-wrapped dates which were also out of this world. Our chorizo & sausage flatbread came next which was a very generous serving. The flatbread was unlike any other with the unique toppings served here. Finally, we had ordered the stuffed chicken and that is the only dish I wouldn't highly recommend. While not bad, it was just chicken with no unique touches. All in all, I am so glad I was able to dine at La Cave and will definitely return upon my next trip to Vegas.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

A bit dark when you walk in. There was a guy sitting at a table to the left. When I walked in he got up and went behind the counter and turned on the lights above the food. Looked like they had a decent lunch rush so they must be pretty popular in the area (only know this because the trays were pretty empty and the register had a lot of receipts still attached to it. So I though I may have just stumbled upon something good. Ordered the bowl and he went into the back to fill up the to-go bowl with white rice. He came back out to front trays and topped off my rice with a bunch of teriyaki chicken. Not a bad portion for $3.50. The meat was actually pretty tender and juicy but lacked much flavor. Definately needed more teriyaki sauce. The rice was fine, no complaints.\\nNot a horrible spot, might give it another try and have a combo so I can try the other items they have. I wouldn't recommend going outside of prime hours as the food probably sits. I stopped in around 1:30pm. \\nI only give 2 stars because nothing stood out about the meal or the place and the guy was grumpy and looked almost pissed off he had to get up to help me. I even left a dollar tip and it looked like it killed him when he mustered up a half-hearted \\\"\"thank you\\\"\".\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

It opens at 5:00, and if you want to sit in the lounge, make sure you do so before 9:00 or so; at 10:00 it becomes a club with a cover charge, and after 9:15 they start setting up and it gets a little loud. The drink menu ranges from $12-18, with most drinks $12-14. Steep but for where you are not really that bad. I ordered the grapefruit rosemary mojito and unfortunately it wasn't well made; the rosemary was not muddled in the bottom of the glass, so it just floated around, got in the way, and didn't impart much flavor. The other drinks in our party were much better. \\n\\nService was fine but not much more than adequate.

At first impression, this place seems like a cool hangout for weekend get togethers, but upon further look, you can definitely tell this place is in serious need of a facelift. The columns are missing chunks of tile, the tables and barstools have seen better days and are falling apart, and one of the tvs we couldn't tell if it was just old or if there was some dried substance running down it. Overall the place just looks dark and dirty. On to the food....\\n\\nThe menu at this location is not the same updated menu from the Scottsdale location but still has similar dishes. We opted for \\\"\"tableside\\\"\" guac (our favorite), and the fundido. The appetizers came out lightening fast, which you would think is a good thing, but it was almost too fast. The guac was brought out to us rather than made tableside  and had brown oxidation and oil separated from the dip like it had been sitting out all day. You could tell from the taste as well it was not fresh. The fundido was similar, like congealed velveeta that had been sitting out too long. We also had to separate some chips out from our basket because they were soggy with oil. For entree we shared a 6 taco basket with chicken tinga, grilled steak, the mahi taco, and the breaded fish taco. My boyfriend described the tinga as \\\"\"alright\\\"\" and while the flavor of the steak was good, the pieces were minced so small that the texture was unappealing, almost like dog food. The chipotle crema saved the mahi taco but I think the taco was missing avocado slices, I couldnt remember from the menu if that was supposed to be included or not.

Usually I never review a restaurant after the \\\"\"first look\\\"\", my standard is 3 visits, but I felt since my two guests have both been here and were very positive I would give it a go. \\n\\nWe chose to go on a Friday at noon, hoping for fewer customers and perhaps better service. Our decision was correct as far as fewer customers, only 4 other tables, hopes were high and quickly dashed. Our less than enthusiastic server Mariela acted as if we were bothering her by our mere presence. When my dining companions ordered ice water only, you could see  the annoyance in the server's face, however when I ordered an over priced coffee drink she seemed to perk up.  Thus began our dining experience.\\n\\nMy friends and I ordered Eggs Benedict-Florentine with home fries, The Tammy breakfast sandwich with sweet potato tots and the Ham Steak with red eye gravy, two over hard hard hard eggs and hash browns, I duly emphasized \\\"\"hard on the over hard.\\n\\nThe wait for the food was adequate. \\nThe food arrived; the presentation on the Florentine and the Tammy was nicely done and my friend was very happy with the flavor of the hollandaise, many times hollandaise is not lemony enough, however I noticed the sauce did not stick to the eggs and dripped to the bottom of the plate leaving the english muffin bathed in a sea of sauce...ewww, obviously not properly prepared, probably did not cook eggs and reduction long enough before adding butter. The home fries did not look very appetizing and my friend did not touch them.\\n\\nNo comments on the Tammy sandwich, positive or negative, the sweet potato tots were fine.\\n\\nNow we come to the disaster. If you are familiar with Ham steak and red eye gravy  you know that it is generally a 3/4 inch slice of pan seared ham (preferably seared in a cast iron pan) with a sauce which consists of hot coffee added to the pan juices and emulsified with  cold butter.

We ordered a few appetizers, thank goodness, because our food did not come for another 30 minutes. Our server was kind of a jerk and did not come and check on us. The manager came over one time but all she did was take more drink orders, did not apologize for the long wait or the horrible service. We ordered chips and salsa but the salsa was way too spicy even for me to eat and I love spicy food. The next time we saw the server we had to ask for our bill, we paid with a couple of cards and the rest cash.

We had this special detail (a baby blanket) on top which cost an extra $20, but judging by the picture would be well worth it because it looked so cute.\\n\\nWhen I went to pick it up, I asked for a red velvet cupcake because I had read they had the best red velvet cupcakes anywhere. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because of that cupcake -- it wasn't fresh or moist. The icing was delicious, but I didn't love the cupcake. \\n\\nBut the cake for the shower -- O. M. G. People were going absolutely nuts over this cake. It was hands-down, the BEST cake I've ever eaten at ANY kind of party or celebration, EVER. Moist, fresh, tasty, gorgeous, delicious. Five stars for that cake, for sure. \\n\\nSo I would definitely custom-order a fresh cake and not pick a cupcake out of the case. :-) The people there were all VERY helpful and friendly - the guy even carried the cake out to my car.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

(I should have said only the EMPTY ones) ALL of our dishes from the garlic bread and wings sat on the table the ENTIRE time. we ordered the White pizza and realized when we got it there was no ricotta on it. I didnt want to complain I was tired of this place. The table behind us never had their pizza put in and they sat after us, and barely got their pizza as we were talking out the door.

We did the check in at the airport and  avoided the long lines at the mgm  lobby. I read as many reviews as I could in the 70 days  before our trip so I knew exactly what to expect. Some of the idiots on here shouldve done the same thing and maybe they wouldn't be bitching about stupid little things like \\\"\"omg  the TV in our room wasn't a flat screen!!, OMG we did not have  a coffee maker in our room!!! OMG the water pressure in the bathroom  was weak(turn the knob idiot)!! OMG  we were at the very edge of the strip.\\\"\"  Hey MORONS, that's what websites like this one and trip advisor are for.  Quit complaining because you were too stupid to research your trip...\\n The rooms were perfectly acceptable. Average size, comfy bed, great view of strip if you ask nicely. We  were lucky enough to  get a room on the 21st floor, next to our friends so no complaints about that.  Reception  on TV was sub par but who's watching TV in Vegas? Casino is really nice and you can hardly smell the smoke. AS previous reviews have stated, casino has a nice perfume to cover smell up. Dining options are a plenty, from $$$$-$. So if you lose tons of money like I did, there is always McDonald's :) \\nPool area is overrated.  A bunch of douche bag drunks when I was there and the pool had a disgusting layer of suntan lotion floating above it at all times(In directors pool at least).  Weather was nice but pool needed to be 100 times colder  then the nasty luke warm  temp it was on my one and only trip down there(nice little walk btw)...\\n You should def try to catch Ka if you are there(awesome awesome show) you will be amazed!!

We had the baby back rib dinner with coleslaw, cowboy beans and sweet potato pie.  i'll start with the pie.  If you are picturing a nice, normal size piece of pie you will be disappointed.  If you are familiar with the miniature, 3-inch BAMA pecan pies from gas station stores, this is exactly what you get -- a 3-inch disposable pie tin with a dark mixture in it resting on what looks like pressed brown sugar (not crust) but isn't sweet.  The filling itself was very mediocre.\\n\\nOnto the coleslaw.  Like so many other reviews I have now read about their food, it is the strangest tasting coleslaw we have ever tasted.  It had an overwhelming flavor of some spice that is just not compatible with barbeque.  It tastes like medicine.  We could not identify if it had mint, tarragon or cilantro in it--or all three but it was overwhelming.  (Imagine the taste of mint or licorice with barbeque--yuck!  No way is this \\\"\"Southern coleslaw.\\\"\"   I have lived all over the South and have never had this weird flavor, medicine tasting coleslaw.\\n\\nOnto the babyback ribs.  first,, I do want to say that they are very good quality, meaty babybacks.  The problem is that they are not being properly prepared.  First if all, any chef or good home grillmaster knows you should always strip the layer of sinew off the back of each rib bone before cooking.  This was not done.  When my husband grills them, they fall off the bone.  These were wet like they had just come out of a wet steamer pan or were just boiled but not baked or grilled thereafter.  When we bit into them, we had to tug hard to even pull the rib meat off the bone.  My husband, in utter frustration, created an aluminum foil tent over them, slathered them with the extra barbeque sauce we had ordered and baked them at 350 degrees for over an hour.  Then the rib  meat came right off the bone without the slightest chewiness.

The interior is simple and lovely. The staff are bilingual and super friendly. The fries and poutine are tasty, and the pints of beer are most welcome.

Every meat seemed to be styled from a different city (Kansas City brisket, Memphis pulled pork, St.louis ribs, etc.) so the place really didn't have it's own identity. The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example, the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy, basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it, so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising, but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor. The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate (pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side, not BBQ sauce on top). Honestly, I didn't finish it and as much as I hate to waste food I threw at least half of it away.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

All i can say is that I was really disappointed and ended up feeling a little sick for the rest of the night.  We called in advance to see if they could do something special for her birthday (like a dessert, etc. that said Happy Birthday) and they immediately told us that they didn't comp any desserts but that they could do something on a dessert we chose (which we agreed to).  \\n\\nThe service was a worse than what I had expected and the food was definitely worse than expected.  3 of us ordered the salmon and my other friend and I ordered the short rib.  I heard the salmon was a little undercooked and underwhelming.  The short rib was a huge disappointment - it was very dry and while it was tender, it didn't really go down very well.  I even had to ask for more sauce in hopes of ameliorating the situation, but the sauce didn't help that much.  The mac and cheese was delicious - maybe the best part of my meal.\\n\\nWe ordered two desserts to share all around and we even went to remind our waiter to do write happy birthday on at least one of the desserts and we were assured that they were taking care of it.  The two desserts came and none of them had any writing on it.  Then after we were eating for 5 minutes, a third dessert came out with a candle.  It was a pistachio souffle and we were all surprised at how nice it looked.  Until the bill came and they ended up charging us for it even though we didn't order it.\\n\\nThe bill ended up coming out late and after we wrote clear instructions on how to split the bill four ways, there was a lot of confusion and it was clear that they ran our cards a couple of times before figuring out exactly how to charge a specific amount.\\n\\nAll in all, I was really disappointed with the service and the quality of food -- definitely wouldn't come back here.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

It's funny, I'd expect Phoenix proper to have the best Chinese food out of at least the metro area. But no luck. Uhh well. \\n\\nAnyways, The Golden Phoenix looked like it was going to be a winner. Good decor and ambiance for a Chinese food restaurant, large menu, great reviews and located in a strip mall (that's where all the best ones are, I'm sure of it).  Sadly, it wasn't as big as a hit as I had hoped.\\n\\nAmbiance: Great for a chinese good spot\\nTake-Out Service: Eh. I called it in, they said it would take 15 minutes but it ended up taking about 25. When I walked in I was given a cold look by the waitress and pointed to the hostess stand. This could have been because I was wearing sweatpants and a baggy tee, but in my defense,  I had literally just gotten a root canal. Who dresses up after a root canal? \\nPrice: Pretty fair. $20 for an appetizer, soup and main dish. \\nFood: Crab puffs: DELICIOUS. Perfect texture.  Soup: Not what I expected, but pretty good. I got the egg drop soup. Main Dish: I am a vegetarian so I got the black mushroom and bean curd dish. I think my ordering skills may have been the problem because who orders a dish of all mushrooms? It tasted, well... really, really mushroomy.  And not in a good way. It was kinda gross. I couldn't finish it. I know this doesn't make sense b/c I ordered a mushroom dish so I should expect a mushroom taste,  but there was some kind of funk going on. And there were no other flavors in the dish, just mushroom funk. The tofu, however was cooked well. \\n\\nOverall, the meal was alright, but kind of a disappointment. I feel this may have been my fault for ordering such a weird dish, so to be fair, I will try it again and let you know what I think. \\n\\nJust learn from my mistakes, don't order anything mushroomy.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Our group was sitting at 3 four tops put together, and a long bench seat on one side.

After my visit this past weekend, I guess I'm calling it quits.  The bottom line is that it's not worth going to a place when the odds are the service and food will sorely disappoint.  \\n\\nWe had two people visiting from out of town, and forgot Dish was closed, so we figured \\\"\"hey, the Diamond wasn't too bad last time, let's go there.\\\"\"  Luckily, there was no wait, the four of us sat down, asked what the specials were and it turned out they were out of the specials.  Two of us then ordered the black bean burger.  They were out of that too.  We got some other stuff, and a starter of fried pickles, which were okay.  My friend asked the waiter if the tomatoes were fresh, because she was thinking about a BLT.  The waiter seemed offended and gave a dismissive,  \\\"\"yes.\\\"\"  Then we waited and waited for the food.  It took way too long to come out.\\n\\nWe finally got our dishes.  I was okay with mine, but everyone else was very disappointed.  It was as if Diamond shops for the absolute bottom-rung ingredients.    If you put a salad on a menu, it should be at least somewhat appetizing.  The small block burger was a sad, ugly  thing.  The tomatoes were hard and without much flavor.  One person at our table referred to the general quality of the food as \\\"\"disgusting.\\\"\"  I was embarrassed to have brought friends there.\\n\\nThe take-away lesson here is that it's great to be a local institution.  It's great to have cool decor and a loyal clientele.  But if you're a restaurant, it's still all about the food for most of your patrons.  You need to have quality food.  And don't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner.  Especially when you're charging $9 or more for some plates.  A lot of real diners serve superior food at half the price.\\n\\nSo the Diamond is still a great place to get a drink, but they've got to overhaul nearly everything...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Sadly, this one counts as a big loss.\\n\\nAside from the typical decor, it doesn't even feel like a restaurant. Plates and utensils are washed en masse, resulting in eating surfaces that look like they were simply sprayed with a hose and dipped in sanitation solution. In other words, everything looks dirty.\\n\\nThe food is awful. There's really no other way to put it. Looking at positive reviews, I can't for the life of me understand how anyone could eat this stuff with a smile. Maybe low prices are intoxicating their sense of judgment or they have the perfect combination of deadened taste buds and iron stomachs. The only other buffet I've been to that's worse than this one was at Sante Fe Station, and that one induced vomiting.\\n\\nOne can't help but shake the feeling this is the foods last chance at being served. Most of the options appear to be right at the borderline of expiration, or at least of the lowest quality. There are seven sections: BBQ, American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Dessert and the Salad Bar. Don't even think about seafood, because there isn't any. I did my best to try a bit of everything, but it was tough finding anything appetizing from the Asian or Mexican areas. They don't even look right.\\n\\nMeats are profoundly dry, akin to soft wood. Vegetables are fresher than anything, but the taste of the cooked ones manages to be awful as well. Fruit amounts to little more than watermelon. Meanwhile, you have a bountiful selection of breads. Great. And don't forget dessert. It rounds out the stomach cramps nicely. Though to be fair, they do have a gelato station that sticks out like a sore thumb in a place like this.\\n\\nI can handle a bad meal as much as anyone, but this stuck with me the rest of the day, assaulting my stomach with night terrors.

Nothing they serve is entirely challenging but for a lot of Pittsburghers, it probably appears that way.\\n\\nEither way, there's no way to argue about the quality of the food. The ingredients are seasonal and local and the cooking is inspired. Eleven is probably the most upscale of the Big Burrito restaurants but the stuffiness that comes with that atmosphere is wholly missing.\\n\\nI love being able to order food off a restaurant's menu and recognizing the name of the farms that supply their proteins.\\n\\nThe service at Eleven is exceptional and the food is great. A lot of people seem to have a problem with Big Burrito but I think they are wholly responsible for a lot of the fine dining scene in Pittsburgh. Mad Mex, as laid back and casual as it is, is a great way to introduce your palette to flavors that will lead you to bigger and much more challenging flavors. Eleven is Big Burrito's attempt at the prize at the end of that journey and I think for most people, it's sufficient.\\n\\nFor a more in-depth review you can read the article on my web site. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/02/eleven-brought-coma/\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Granted they were pretty packed, but there was about enough room for 20 seats on the patio and it was a beautiful day, so no reason not to use it. We asked the hostess if we could just go in for a drink while we wait, she said no. It was like Fort Knox trying to even go in. After over 1hr  (quoted 40 min) wait we finally got sat at the bar. The staff was rude, including the manager...he was fussing at the bartender in front if us, totally unprofessional. We asked if there was drink specials, and the response was \\\"\"uh-no don't you think free lunch is special enough\\\"\" Dirty glasses were set in the bar beside us and ignored for most if the time we sat there. The food was bad, lacked flavor and selection. A little salt and pepper makes a world of difference...that should be culinary 101. Most if the time we went up to the buffet it was empty.  They need to leave the shrimp and grits up to Charleston restaurants, it tasted like instant grits w/shrimp thrown in as an after though....I make better shrimp and grits. No way would I'd pay $10 for this. Either they weren't prepared for the crowd or they have no idea what good food taste like. Also, they were doing free lunch yesterday and several people behind us in line said they had come yesterday for the same... They got in faster than we did...didn't think that was right, they'd already taken advantage if the freebie. Would NOT recommend this place, there are too many other great restaurants close by to chose from...spend your money there.

Her kids are really into horseback riding, and it was blizzard conditions at their house, so they wanted to take advantage of our nice weather to get on some horses. She found a Groupon for this place and purchased them for the whole family. Now, she lived in Arizona until she was thirty, so I'm surprised she wanted to do a western trail ride. It seemed a little gimmicky. I was expecting the owners and trail guides to be hamming it up for the tourists, calling us greenhorns and such.\\n\\nWhen we got there we had to fill out the insurance waivers, and everything seemed really disorganized. We had indicated that we were all going to wear helmets on the ride (I'd rather look stupid than have some dumb horse put me in a wheelchair) and they seemed irritated that we were trying to find helmets that actually fit, especially for the kids. The helmets were all stored on shelves inside and were dusty as heck. I got the idea that they just threw them up there after the previous trail ride without doing anything to sanitize them. Luckily, my head hasn't been itchy, so no lice. They could have an air compressor and some Lysol, at least, to blow the dust off and disinfect them.\\n\\nWhen we got out to the stables, they gave us a curt speech about safety and following the trail guide. They told us to always follow the horse in front of us, too, and never stray off the path. They then assigned us horses, based on our riding skills (indicated on the waiver). There was an older gentleman that seemed like he actually might have cared about the customers, but the younger guys definitely didn't. I was told to go to a horse toward the end of the stable. When I got there he was tied up, so I proceeded to climb on. One of the employees yelled at me to stop and came over with the stairs. Fair enough...they want people to be safe, I guess. There's no reason to yell, though. When I was getting on the horse he told me I smelled like sunscreen. I told him I didn't want skin...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I usually get the same thing every time. Medium marinated 10 oz. flat Iron steak with potatoes and a salad. \\n\\nBest. Thing. Ever. \\n\\nMy first few times here, I tried a few other things, but after giving the steak a try... I can't pass it up. And, let me say, I hate steak. I never eat it anywhere else because I hate chewing on boot-leather, and have never been pleased with it. Here, though, it is amazing - and the price can't be beat! Some other things on the menu are pricey, but the 10 oz. flat iron is an amazing deal for a fantastic steak. If you haven't tried it, you need to. I love it that the kitchen is viewable from the main dining room, which not only makes you feel a bit more secure about who's handling your food, but you can also see the head Chef working and maintaining his line of cooks - such a professional kitchen! \\n\\nAnd, of course, if your food is ever not how you ordered it, they take it back and fix it for you, no questions or fuss.

Safe to say that I'm not alone in wondering where the overly generous 5-star reviews are coming from. Good yelpers aren't so easily impressed. 5-stars are rare, and usually hard-earned; saved for the highest level of culinary (and consumer) enjoyment.\\n\\nGood luck and continue with the improvements.

Very Victorian. It harkens back to the supper clubs of the olden days. I half expect to find gentlemen in top hats when I entered the door. Instead I only found a few mid-day drinkers playing video poker.  Being a sports bar, of course there are wide-screens all over the shop, which seem a bit anachronistic given that the place is swathed in late 19th-century red velvet drapery.\\n\\nInterestingly, the owners have placed a few old-fashioned items on the menu, such as baked brie, which are juxtaposed with more modern tasters, such as the deep-fried mashed potato bites. The menu is fairly enticing.  Sadly the food falls short. It feels like everything here is made to sound impressive, but, looks and tastes like it was cooked at Wendy's. I would have assumed it was all fresh-made, but it all tastes to me like it originated in the freezer.\\n\\nToday, I tried the Chicken Florentine Soup. It definitely came from a can.  No doubt about it. Then I got a California Turkey Burger.  The lettuce was limp, the avocado was almost non-existent, and the turkey patty was too salty.  However, there was a nice char on the patty, and I do love grill marks.\\n\\nMy main complaint is that this swanky restaurant has tremendous potential and no one here seems to know how to reach it.  The menu was promising. The descriptions of each item got me salivating.  Unfortunately, my dining experience turned out to be like a bad blind date:  your friend tells you how great this hamburger is, and then you finally meet it... and it is nothing compared to the burger you tasted in your dreams.\\n\\nMy advice to Elixir: if you're going to do gourmet pub food, actually do gourmet pub food.  It's just not right to titillate a person's tongue without bringing the taste buds to climax; wink, wink.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I loved what I had, but I felt like there was a bit of an identity crisis involved. The food was eclectic, but also kind of random. They are called \\\"\"meat and potatoes\\\"\" but didn't really have the menu that reflected that name. Maybe that's meant to be the irony, for which case, they did fine. For example, if you wanted just a steak (I'm not a steak person, btw), then you'd have to order the steak offering that is for 2 people. You'd think that a simple option, like steak, is what this place would own. Otherwise, the mussels for an appetizer were great and I also loved my entree (but to be honest, I don't remember what I got now).\\n\\nService: Pretty decent, although our server seemed to be in a bad mood and the others around us seemed to have a server that enjoyed what they were doing.

They do have a list of \\\"\"mantras\\\"\" or something on their menu and #4 encourages ordering the food specifically to your taste so if I do go back in (not going to happen) I would ask the English muffin to be toasted and crispy, the bacon to be crispy and the tomato to NOT be grilled. This would offset the avocado, egg and hollandaise sauce and likely make a fantastic breakfast, well aside from the giant loogie under the poached egg I would undoubtedly get for being so picky. \\n\\nSeriously! Does every breakfast place in AZ peak out at average? I have yet to be impressed, even by the ones with relatively good reviews. If I win the lottery I am starting a quality breakfast joint in the valley. \\n\\nMy server Paula was nice, the seats were classic beat down unconfortable seats.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

The food at King's Kitchen is amazing (though a tiny bit pricey) and the restaurant seems to have a really great purpose.  However, after the treatment we got on our anniversary I doubt I'd ever go back.  My husband and I went to the restaurant to celebrate eleven years of marriage.  We were expecting a special event, especially after reading all the glowing reviews.  What we got was a waitress who treated us like dirt, while treating her only other table at the time like old friends.  \\n\\nWe sat at our table, and when we saw a woman roll her eyes as she stared our way I whispered to my husband \\\"\"Oh man.  I hope she's not our waitress.  She looks like she hates us already!\\\"\"  Lucky us, here she came.  She said nothing about specials, gave us no suggestions, had to come back to hear our drink orders TWICE, and all we ordered was tea.  And ten minutes later, when a couple of women sat in her section across from us, we got the jealous privilege of watching her gush all over these ladies, telling them in detail the specials and what came with them, which dishes were good and even telling one of the women to try a dish she had told five minutes earlier me was SOLD OUT.  What?  And while our appetizer sat on the counter where we could see it, she held a ten-minute conversation with these ladies about the conference they were attending and oh my gosh, we're all from the same hometown?  What a coincidence!  Let's talk some more!  After that the loud PLUNK as our appetizer was carelessly thrown on our table was audible throughout the restaurant.  Before we could even request a refill on our tea, she was gone, back to finish the conversation our appie had so rudely interrupted.\\n\\nWe didn't get our food for forty minutes, during which time we got to watch our neighbors, who arrived fifteen minutes after us, dig into two plates of delicious-looking food.  By the time we got our tepid but delicious meals we had already been in the restaurant for an hour...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Sometimes it's something small, like the onion and pickle that are supposed to come with every platter but only show up about half the time. Sometimes it's something medium and annoying like a missing side. Sometimes it's something mission-critical, like the bacon on a baked potato. They did, however, make sure to include BBQ sauce! With my baked potato, so the bag had a smoked meat aroma that taunted me in the absence of the missing bacon. #fail\\n\\nIt's a shame too, because the food here is actually decent. At $4, those giant stuffed baked potatoes are a great deal. Their BBQ isn't the best I've ever had, but it's certainly good for a quick-service counter joint, and I'd sooner eat here than the flavorless Famous Dave's and the stupefyingly overrated Memphis Championship BBQ. And they get bonus points for serving smoked turkey year-round.\\n\\nOther good meats include the pulled pork and the hot link. The best sides here are the waffle fries, cole slaw, potato salad and baked potato casserole. The sweet tea is as it should be, and they offer complimentary pickles and soft-serve ice cream, which is a nice value-added touch.\\n\\nThe BBQ sauce is perfectly acceptable but nothing special. They have sweet and hot variants for a little spice of life. I prefer the hot, although I don't think it even has the slightest bit of heat to it.\\n\\nBottom line on this place? Decent BBQ, especially for the price, but be sure to audit your order, because the only thing you can depend on with their service is its complete lack of dependability.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

While the rest of my friends seemed rather happy with their choices, one was very happy the rest meh-ish happy, I received three falafel balls on shredded lettuce with a small cup of humus.\\n\\nIt was so disappointing, I don't even know where to start. The falafel were deep fried for so long that they were clearly burned on the outside, dark-dark brown almost blackened. There was no moisture, none, left in them. The shell of the falafel, what should have been a thin crispy crust, had turned into a half an inch thick uncrackable concrete-like substance. I had to hack away at it (really) with my knife to get at the inside, which was dry and tasted like sawdust with a tiny hint of chickpea.\\n\\nAND because I didn't want to ruin my friends birthday by complaining about my food, I ate it like a good little girl and suffered a massive stomach ache for the rest of the evening. No wonder, those balls were so hard they would have shattered like glass had I thrown them on the floor. And that's also what they felt like in my stomach, shards of glass.\\n\\nNow, the rest of the group was -let me reiterate- okay with their choices. No matter that the bread that came with it was kinda bland and the humus was ... well,... meh. \\n\\nMaybe I should give this place another chance, but I really don't want to suffer through another brick-induced 6-hour stomach ache again.

I've seen people start waiting for this place at 8:30pm when doors open at 10pm.  The second time I went was Labor Day weekend and the line was flowing- well because this place has a 6k person capacity too!  It helps that they have this huge outside area where the pool is.  I don't know if that's gonna be closed off for the winter.. but yeah just like any Vegas club they are trying to make money.  For Labor day weekend girls were 30 and guys were 100! People were still willing to pay that. \\n\\nThis place is dope because its huge, play a variety of music, decent dance floor, outside pool area so its pretty, and has a GAMBLING area.  The boyfriend won almost a thousand dollars at the craps table.  The Black Jack tables start pretty high at 25 and 50 tho. \\n\\nAnyways go here! You won't be disappointed.

So, we decided to try it out as we were both hungry for Mexican food. Ate here on a Friday night, waited about 10 minutes to be seated and had ordered off the gluten free menu shortly after. I choose the three ground beef tacos on soft corn torts. Most gluten free torts aren't soft, so I questioned that before ordering. Also, I wanted to substitute the meat for carne asada as I am not a fan of ground beef but the waiter said that they put MSG in their carne asada. Yuck, I thought and decided to stick with ground beef. They were okay, nothing special. They do have yummy green mild salsa though, which was better than my entire dinner. Service was great. I haven't heard that a Mexican restaurant uses MSG in their food before though. My friend order their chicken and steak fajitas, she said it was okay. I wondered though if her meat had MSG too.

Theres a pretty cool looking american flag made out of egg cartons on one of the walls, which I have to admit looked pretty awesome.\\n\\nI ordered the New York Omelet, which has chicken, spinach, tomatoes, and onions, I think, covered in your choice of hollandaise or cajun sauce. I knew i wanted the hollandaise, but I was kinda curious about what this cajun sauce was too, and I think the server could tell I was conflicted so she brought be both on the side! The cajun sauce really tasted more like a creamy chili, actually. It was good, just not what I wanted on the omelet, so I slathered on the hollandaise and got to eating. There is an english muffin and a side of hash browns as well.\\n\\nThe omelet was quite delicious, though I would say the chicken was a little on the dry side--not terribly so but enough to notice it. The hash browns were really well cooked and not at all greasy. I also ordered a tall glass of OJ, and was very glad to have fresh squeezed arrive at my table.\\n\\nThe servers are very friendly, willing to have a laugh, and kinda spunky considering the early hour; they help to get your morning started off right. And did I mention theyre good looking too? Ok, lets just be honest: theyre freakin hot. Ok? If you like good breakfast being served by hot, spunky, friendly waitresses, get it as US Egg.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Planet Fitness is just cardio machines, weight machines, and freeweights. They've also got tanning booths if you can't get enough sun in Arizona for some reason. )\\n\\nTheir machines are well kept and better than anything I've used at other gyms (LA Fitness, Pure Fitness). The gym is very clean. I can't vouch for the locker rooms because I prefer not to use public showers in general. \\n\\nThere are always machines available to use, the place is never uncomfortably crowded or loud. The staff will help you out with a particular machine if you need it, and they have a personal trainer on staff that you can set up appointments with (charged separately, since it's a separate company).\\n\\nThere's some debate among the management, apparently, as to whether or not they should ban talking on cell phones in the gym. I'm all for a ban, cause I really hate having to listen to people talk on their phones too loud (especially when they just sit on the machines to do it...and don't work out). \\n\\nAll in all, I like this gym more than any other I've been in. I feel comfortable there and can zone out like I want to.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

We both had steaks, one a filet and the other a ribeye, both of which were expertly cooked to order.

I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the skewer by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right.

We were patient for awhile but after over 15 minutes we were starting to get a little frustrated.  What added to the frustration was the fact that there were 4 employees (3 of which looked like managers) in a circle chatting it up and laughing.  My husband even took a picture on his cell phone of the employees, which I attached to my original email.  What we couldn't quite wrap our heads around was why wouldn't one of those employees jump behind the counter to at least ring up the orders?

Mix lounge is a great place to hangout. The view (top of the south end of the Strip looking north) is the best on or off the strip. I had assumed that the Luxor would block its view but that's totally not the case. There's an outdoor section divided up between general balcony and bottle service. I recommend the bottle service, not as pricey as a real club and more breathing room. And the waitresses are more attentive than other places.

Since I'd like to think I'm open to trying new things I walked on in. The deli is quite the interesting little place. Italian posters have taken over the store and it's kept dark. They seemed to have a vast array of authentic Italian foods for cooking at home. The menu offered variety of sandwiches as well as pizza (sold by the slice) and spaghetti. I settled on a salami sub. Wow, I have never realized a sub can taste SO good!! The salami with the cheese they used plus the condiments gave the sub a nice little kick. Everything tasted quite fresh. The tomatoes were smaller and shiny, bright red. The prices are great. What I could tell a sub runs 2.50- 4.00. Well worth it for its size. They also have the option of getting a side with your sub. While waiting for my sub to be prepared I did grab an orange Italian ice from the freezer. Once at work, I found it had no taste. It was just orange colored ice. All in all, great experience!

I asked for the Jen Red pork and Pollo Diablo with pork fried rice and black beans. I didn't get any pork... Neither the Jen Red nor in the fried rice.

There seemed to be twice as much white rice in my girlfriend's single bowl as I was given (on top of getting meatless pork fried rice).

It appears as if the ice cream machine was being clean, so no ice cream desert, one section of the dining room was closed off and blocked with chairs, which by the way was also blocking a fire exit, I told the manager but she just knodded her head, admited the exit was block and then went back to work, without moving the chairs.  I'm sure glad it didn't catch fire while we were eating.  \\n\\nIf you are wondering what kind of problem a couple of chairs could cause, just think something like Beverly Hills Supper Club Fire, in the 1970's.  \\n\\nAlthought the food tasted o.k., the side dishes were not with the proper sandwich, making things a little frustrating.  \\n\\nI've e-mail the corporate office about the whole blocking the exit thing, it will be interesting to hear what they have to say.  I'll update when I hear from them.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

The server, I believe his name was Jason, was nice while going over all the specials, advising his favorites, and the wine list.\\n\\nWhen he returned to take our order he became cold as ice towards us when we only ordered a salad and lasagna with no alcohol.  I guess he figured he wasn't going to get a big tip if we were not ordering an expensive meal.\\n\\nWhile we were eating, another waitress got us more bread and even refiled our water glasses. What he didn't know is that we always tip big no matter the cost of the meal, it is all about the service. Furthermore, the reason we ordered the lasagna was because I had to eat something soft due to jaw surgery the week before and could not drink alcohol due to this surgery.  He even had the nerve to say when he began to clean the table, \\\"\"I will try to carry these (plates) back without dropping them while making minimum wage.\\\"\"  What an insult to the customer!!!\\n\\nFor the first time ever we did NOT leave a tip.  Someone there needs to teach him what to say, or just shut up. What a rude ass he was.  We go to Vegas two or three times a year and always eat at Maggiono's.  I will be writing a personal letter to the manager and unless we receive an apology from them we will not be back there.

He's unable to master the language and talks like what as a kid we called \\\"\"Farmers\\\"\" (Turned out we were wrong as most are better educated than the urban folks) by using the basest Joual vulgarities. There's a difference between the word FOOD and the word MEAL, but this is lost on him. Plus his table etiquette is ridiculously missing from a man who everyone seems to consider a great chef. There's a way to holding a spoon my friends. Then there's his condescending behaviour with even his family and friends when he's on TV shows such as l'\\u00c9picerie on Radio-Canada.\\n\\nThe Restaurant: Hip and modern in tight quarters but it works.

Almost lost some points since the waiter asked if I wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). But whatevs. The martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. It was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in Vegas.  \\n\\nI had the most elegantly presented heirloom tomato soup in the entire world.  The waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. Stunning. And the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. Very very well done here.\\n\\nSince I was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a Flay joint), I got the kobe flat iron steak. It was also exceptional. The steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. It was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. I'm only sorry I was too full for dessert.  \\n\\nThey brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and I was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great.
