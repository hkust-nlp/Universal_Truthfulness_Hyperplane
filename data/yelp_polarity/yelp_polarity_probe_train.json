After waiting 20 minutes for my turn, the rep tells me that the internet reservation was for one day instead of the two I needed. Fine, it was probably my mistake when I was booking it online. He tells me that the second day will be an additional $11 because it is an extension. WTF???? Not so fine, but I suck it up. I try to add my wife as an aditional driver and he says there's an extra charge for that. WTF???? I tell him forget it. He asks if I want the insurance scam. I decline. He asks me if I am fully covered, and I said 'yes'. So what does he do? He begins to tell me what I am responsible for. WTF???? After a minute, I tell him I understand what it means when I decline their insurance. He gives me a stare and says something under his breath. WTF???? I just wanted to get my car and get to the hotel and casinos. After I finish with the man who is unhappy with his life and job, I thought I was home free. Not so fast.\\n\\nAfter you finish with the counter, you have to go to another line to pick up your car. That line took another 20 minutes away from my Vegas life.  There was only one old (albeit, sweet) lady working this line. WTF???? She had to get out of the little office and show people to their cars. In addition, there were people bringing their keys back due to issues with their cars (air conditioning, trunk not opening)  making our wait in line even longer. WTF???? While in line, I started talking to two other customers and they had the same complaint about their customer reps. They got pushy about buying the insurance and had a hissy fit after it was declined. An hour later, I was out of there with my mid-size. \\n\\nWTF???? This should be Thrifty's slogan...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Nice selection of options, except for my colleague, who prefers chicken over beef.  No chicken on this menu!  I'm fine with that.\\n\\nThe roasted barley water, was a nice refreshing palate cleanser.  The side dishes were wonderful.  I personally like my kimchi much spicier, but it was  good balance for those less masochistic eaters.  The bibimbap was awesome!  Lots of fresh veggies, and wonderfully tender marinated beef!  I was only slightly disappointed with the fried egg over medium.  I wonder if they would crack it raw into the pot, or do sunny side up.  I will definitely ask next time.  Cooking the yolk into my hot rice is my favorite part of the dish!\\n\\nI was a little surprised that there was only one other table occupied at lunch.  No complaints.  Was a very relaxing little lunch getaway.  The waitress was super friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is hip and the little touches like small tin bowls for your drink, and a trash canister on the table, set it apart just enough to make it a memorable experience.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to a happy hour or dinner time visit, with a larger party.

I have been wanting a new car with the thought of gifting my currently paid off car to my son, who is 18 years old and is the last of my 4 children that is left in  my household.  I have been downsizing everything and enjoying every minute of it, so I thought, why not downsize my wheels?  I have my heart set on a Mini Cooper since my wife of 26 years has one and absolutely loves it, so I thought I would start there.  We went to a place that shall remain unnamed and unreviewed, but it was typical \\\"\"don't want new?  forget you!\\\"\"  They literally walked away from us and didn't help us anymore.  Wow.  I spotted the Fiat lot.  Hmmm, Fiats are small.  They look kind of sporty, especially the Abarth series, so why the heck not?  Oh, and I see a Mini!  Anyway, we parked and got out and we were quickly approached by Ken, one of the sales associates at Towbin Fiat.  He was very professional, very low key and he immediately just asked us what we were looking for.  I believe in being blunt and to the point, so I gave him a price point and what I was looking at.  He showed us what he had and even allowed us to see a car that had just been turned in as a trade in.  It was still getting its safety check.  He also gave us some advice and some suggestions, once again, without any pressure and only in the spirit of trying to help us out.  He was great.  We intend to test drive said car another day when it is ready and we intend to go back and give some of the cars a second look.  I would definitely buy a car here and it looks like I probably will.  \\n\\nThe day after, I called the number on the card Ken provided to ask for some more information on the car I am interested in.

I find this is a view not shared by several of my friends and many trusted fellow reviewers.  \\n\\nFrom many comments I expected a Trader Hoe's type place where I would also have to stop at a Fry's to get everything else...your basics.  Well, it is that to a degree, just not as good in terms of price, quality or health as TJ's.\\n\\nI have never cared for pre-packaged fruit and vegetables -- which admittedly is a criticism I have of Trader Joe's also.  I love being able to select and decide which orange is to my liking at a place like Fry's.\\n\\nMy biggest criticism, however, would have to be its incredibly unhealthy take-and-go food selection.

Where's the social responsibility in that? \\n\\nSmall 8 ounce containers of chicken salad measured at 88 fat grams and 980 calories are more offensive than slightly higher prices or the absence of ecological gestures would have been.  I mean, seriously, is there any chicken product in that salad at all, or is it just a tub of lard with chicken seasoning?  Perhaps this is some sort of sick joke the Brits are making at their fat-ass American counterparts.\\n\\nI left the store with some fruit salad, organic lemonade and a spicy shrimp roll (which, btw was just as awful as TJ's sushi).

After all, up until sushi became a trendy delicacy in the late 20th century, it was actually japanese fast food.\\n\\nTo navigate through its menu, just think Chipotle.  You pick your wrap (seaweed or soy) and rice (brown or white).  Then pick up to three veggies, your protein, then sauces and toppings.  The prices change based on your selection, but for about $6 to $8, you'll walk away with a pretty generous sized roll.  If you don't know what combinations work best, there's a small selection of \\\"\"signature\\\"\" rolls they'll put together for you.  I made a spicy tuna roll with brown rice, jalape\\u00f1o, avocado and chili sauce.  Good and hot!\\n\\nThe food itself is decent.  I would rate the quality of How Do You Roll as a couple of steps above a high-end grocery store sushi bar (Whole Foods, AJ's, Fry's Signature, etc).  But, it's not even close to as good as any of the trendy sushi spots in the valley.\\n\\nIt's not cheap.  But considering it's fresh fish, it's not expensive.

They also have extensive monitoring equipment is in place during surgery, including EKG, pulse oximeters, respiratory rate, CO2 monitors and equipment to maintain core body temperature.

Many of the vet offices I spoke to scheduled as few as 10 minutes, or maybe 15, not enough time in my opinion to really get acquainted with me or my dog, or to ask any questions or share concerns. This may seem silly, but the amount of time the vet spends with each animal can make a big difference in their health. \\n\\nThe vet I saw , Dr. Temple, was flexible.

But instead they brought me Pico de gallo which was very good.  I ordered the chilie relleno which was very tasty.  One in our party had the steak fahitas and she was happy with them.  All in all we were all quite happy with the food as well as the service.\\n4 stars due to no red salsa and they also did not have mango for the mango margaritas and I could not understand why they just didn't go next door and buy them.

My companion and I both got the Divine Throwback. $10 for two eggs, two strips of bacon, home fries, and 2 pancakes. It's $1 extra to substitute red velvet pancakes or french toast. My friend got the red velvet pancakes. She liked them. I got french toast. I wanted regular french toast and got pecan caramel french toast. One piece of regular bread cut into two triangles. The food was good and the service was friendly. However, other than the red velvet pancakes, nothing I can't make at home. I thought the prices were quite high for what you get. There are other places nearby that have similar food with more choices for cheaper prices. We ended up spending $30 minus tax and tip. $15 a person for breakfast?

If you're trying to switch it up from the typical Oldtown Weekend and don't want to go as far as Mill It has a pretty decent night life - doubles up as a club / lounge late night on some weekdays & weekends - great DJ's & they even get some pretty decent live entertainment.\\n\\nDef worth a stop if you're in the area whether its just for a quick drink before a movie or you're having a full meal.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Having travelled to Italy - the type of gelati differs from even region to region. But the essential question remains... does it taste good?\\n\\nThis gelato doesn't taste like the gelati I remember growing up. No, the stuff I grew up with was lighter stuff that you could scarf down large amounts of (my sister said that the stuff we had back home is close to the types of gelati you find in Florence). \\n\\nNonetheless, even though this frozen dessert is not like the gelati I remember, it is still very good.  Being closer to ice cream consistency, this gelati has more a creamy and rich texture. They have an assortment of older favourites (like hazelnut, pistachio, chocolate) and some more innovative flavours (like green tea, kalua banana). Having gone many times, they do rotate flavours. \\n\\nSome people are upset because a small serving size isn't cheap. That is true. Back home (in Canada), a $5 gelati could easily serve 3 or 2 very hungry people. However, that being said, I find that I can't eat too much of Vivido's because it is richer. \\n\\nOne way to make it a little less painful on your wallet is to order a quart to go (which we normally do) and eat it at home.

        "data": "Review:\nBeing a white girl from Gilbert I never thought I would eat at a place that combines fried chicken with waffles.  The naive inner-workings of my brain caused by the culinary repression in the East Valley were so wrong.  So so wrong.  I will never forget the day I went to Lo-Lo's.\\n\\nSometimes when you combine two unexpected foods together you reach this special nirvana that you never thought possible.  For some people it is chocolate and bacon (tried that in a cupcake and did not like it) and for me, I reached the ultimate bliss with chicken and waffles.  May the clouds part and the gods sing hallelujah.\\n\\nWhen the husband and I went, we tried to keep it traditional and ordered some fried chicken, some waffles, some mac and cheese, and some cornbread.  Lo-Lo's clearly believes in the mantra that butter is better.  Everything is loaded with it, and I love it.  The mac and cheese was intensely buttery and creamy, with just the right amount of \\\"\"mush\\\"\" in the macaroni to make it down home and comforting.  The chicken is crispy, crunchy, greasy and flavorful... exactly as it should be.  The waffles are thin, soft and buttery with a hint of spice.  The thin and piping hot maple syrup was served along with the waffles.  I found the best way to combine everything is to shred your chicken as best as you can, sprinkle it on top of your super-buttered waffles, douse it in syrup, and then dive in.  One bite of this and you know what I am talking about.\\n\\nThere is nothing wrong with this place.  It's hectic and loud with the cooks and servers yelling at each other, but it's comforting and peaceful in it's own special way when your server smiles and hands you your mason jar full of soda.  You want authentic?  Go here, and you can't go wrong.\\n\\nLo-Lo's, I will love you forever, my body be damned.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Well, there's a few things wrong with this place.\\n\\nThe staff looked as though they were pissed off. No \\\"\"hello\\\"\" or \\\"\"welcome\\\"\" and no smiles from any of the girls working there. The cashier didn't say a word until we started to order.\\n\\nBeing that it was my roommates first time there, she didn't understand that you got to choose your own meat for whatever dish you'd like. What she said to the cashier was \\\"\"I'd like the teriyaki\\\"\" the cashier asked \\\"\"what kind\\\"\" three times until she finally told her she's supposed to choose her meat. What kind of idiot doesn't say that in the first place? Not to mention her being extremely unfriendly about it.\\n\\nWith my father owning a Japanese restaurant, I know exactly what teriyaki sauce is supposed to taste like. All three of us ordered some and it was completely flavorless! We had to pour soy sauce all over it to taste anything and even then it didn't help. I also had a side of plum sauce that helped a little bit, but why put plum sauce on the side when there's no sauce to begin with?\\n\\nThe spring rolls are too small, they taste decent, but nothing special. \\n\\nThe price was $25 for flavorless food and bad attitudes? I'd rather go to Panda Express and spend the same about for some flavor and happy workers, even if the food is worse for me.\\n\\nAnyways, the first time going there was quite enjoyable compared to this last time, but I will NOT be going back.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Because Ribeye has many happy customers, as well as fellow Yelpers who are fans, and who are marking Ribeye higher, I will try to describe Ribeye as well as I can as I relate my single dining experience. That way, you, the reader, will know what to expect if and when you go.\\n\\nAmbience and Decor:\\nLet me first describe the restaurant's ambience. The restaurant is a dark, windowless interior space. The decor is simple, something like wood or wood-like tables and chairs along with booths. When I was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy. TV's were visible from most seats of our table, so watching a TV show or event while eating is part of Ribeye's draw. I imagine drinks and dinner while watching a football game would be an example. There is a full bar in a space connected to the dining area. \\n\\n\\nFood:\\nThe food at Ribeye is not to my taste. \\n\\nThe ribeye steak is low quality meat. Eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience. Perhaps a hamburger or meatloaf type order would be safer. Ribs are on the menu but I just know that the barbecue sauce would not be better, and might be worse, than that offered by McDonalds.\\n\\nThe salad bar comes with most dinners. The salad bar has a mediocre selection of items, and the quality of each item is basic. Coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli. Freshness of the salad bar is variable by item, depending upon how it turns over. Overall, the salad bar is not worth ordering. It just is not very good.\\n\\nBread is a hot, fresh loaf, but mediocre nonetheless. Also, Ribeye does something to its butter. The butter is whipped up for sure, but they might add sugar or something to it. \\n\\nThe vegetables, and items like baked potato or mashed potatoes are edible, but mediocre. These don't appear to be prepared to order. Unfortunately, potatoes and vegetables lose much of their appeal if they are not eaten when freshly cooked to...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Sometimes there are crazy long lines, other times we walk right up.  Recently I finally signed up for Dollar Express and while the concept is nice, I've found it doesn't actually save any time as frequently there isn't anyone in the parking lot to help you.  This happened to me in Chicago recently.\\n\\nToday may be my last time I will ever patronize (or permit my employees to patronize) Dollar again.  I returned a car after refueling as always and didn't have my gas receipt \\\"\"to prove I filled it within 10 miles\\\"\".  Now while yes I'm aware of this \\\"\"policy\\\"\", I've not come across any receipt Nazis before today.\\n\\nThere have been times I didn't get a receipt, but the check-in people used their BRAINS and looked at the fuel gauge and saw it was full.  The guys at Dollar at the Phoenix airport however, weren't smart enough to see that the car was OVER the full line.  When looking at the mileage I drove, I OBVIOUSLY had to have refueled.  \\n\\nToday the receipt printer at the gas station wasn't working and I didn't have time to wait around for them to fetch someone to try and produce a receipt because I have a plane to catch.  No big deal right?  The car is CLEARLY full, right?  I've rented from Dollar for 10 years and it's never been an issue in the past, right?\\n\\nWRONG!\\n\\nThe large man checking my car in was quite rude about it and when I spoke to the supervisor Enriquez he clearly didn't give a flip either.  (The desk clerk who fetched Enriquez was polite and professional, but unfortunately he had no authority to make things right.)\\n\\nTo Dollar Corporate, I hope you enjoy the $10 you effectively stole from me.

Though it seemed okay when I left Ohana, after washing and styling on my own, I was left with a top layer that is not even on both sides (and I hate top layers altogether), and some uneven, fringy bangs that make my face look round and age me by about ten years. I was especially disappointed because I told her I like to curl it with a large barrel iron to get a nice wave and on lazy days, I like to put it in a ballerina/sock bun.  The bun will be out of the question for at least a month or two because of the way the top layer was cut, and the large barrel curls? It ends up looking like a bad soap opera from the 80s.  I know Ashley would be more than willing to fix the cut for free, but since I've spent the last 20 months growing out my bob, cutting more hair would be even more frustrating.\\n\\nSo, I feel really sad that I might be on the hunt yet again for a Phoenix area stylist that can internally slide cut Asian hair.

I understand if you're having a bad night, you may be off your game, but holy shit at least come by and let us know you're busy, if that's even the case. Oh and another thing- the manager took his time going to every table to ask how their meal was, except for us. Is it because we are a younger couple?

The rice was very good and the stuffed pastry was terrific. I thought lemonade at another restaurant was the absolute best. This was as good and probaly better.

When I first heard of the concept - Asian street market and lounge, I was pretty excited. I've been to Hawker Centers in Singapore and the international food courts of malls in Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Macau and the food there is always great with a fun, high energy environment. FAME was none of those things - it was just an over glorified, expensive lounge-y looking food court.  IMHO, they tried a little too hard on the decor - you really just needed some plastic folding tables, plastic chairs, fluorescent lighting and you'd have something more authentic. \\n\\nThe layout is confusing - some stalls had menus while others didn't. Boba was $9. Need I continue? Stalls included a Beard Papa-boba/dessert place, a Fuku burger, noodle stall, and some dim sum/Chinese BBQ stall. We dropped by around noon on Saturday to check the place out and it was dead. Walked by the Fuku burger and it peaked our interest. I eventually did come back around 1:50 am and ate at Fuku Burger and really liked my meal (got the #5 with jazz fries - good drunk food at reasonable prices). The one downside of Fuku is that it closes at 2 a.m. - it really should be open until at least 3 or 4 a.m. for the club crowd to sober up at. \\n\\nOverall, they need to totally rethink the execution of this place - bring in some high profile brands from LA's SGV and let them set up shop here. Boba can be from Half and Half, desserts from Bambu - it can still be overpriced  b/c as of right now, it's the only option for that kind of stuff on the Strip. At this point,  I'd recommend driving over to Chinatown if you want to get your asian grub on. Only go here if you are desperate for boba, or if you want some good fusion-y burgers.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

If I'm going to be somewhere loud I prefer to hear dance music. This time they played the images on the big screen and it was packed .

The stylist told me they could get the color almost exactly how I wanted it prior to getting it dyed.

Car # 2015 from Star Cabs pulls up and I jump in, my driver is Ruperto R. Jr. and his licences indicated YCS transportation.  So far so good.  \\n\\nI'm in a hurry, the flight leaves in 90 minutes, as he pulls out I see a handmade sign taped to the ceiling that says \\\"\"no credit or debit, cash only\\\"\".  Damn, I have no cash.  \\\"\"Are all cabs cash only?\\\"\" - I ask.  Ruperto says \\\"\"no\\\"\", he doesn't have the credit card machine installed.  I guess I can't count that against him, I made an assumption since it's 2012 and didn't read the sign before jumping in.  Lesson's learned:  ask before you jump in.  \\n\\nHe says he'll take me to US Bank, so he takes a left and soon pull into the bank.  There's an ATM at the door and an ATM in the parking lot for cars to drive up to.  I tell him to just pull in the exit since I am sitting in the back adjacent to him (and no one is there), he opts to pull all the way around instead.  I think there's a language barrier here, but while I'm quite rushed and looking to minimize time he's a bit more laid back.  He pulls up and I can't reach the ATM, and the sun is shining on the screen so I cannot read it, so I squeak out of the door and block the sun and eventually get my cash.  Yay.  \\n\\nRuperto drives me to the airport, when we arrive he pops the trunk and doesn't get out or offer to help.  The bill:   $17.50.  He didn't want to give me change back, when I placed it on the arm rest he just said \\\"\"thank you\\\"\", expecting the rest.  I should have asked for $1.50 back, but I was more concerned about making the flight so I just left it. \\n\\nThere seems to be a grave lack of customer service and due diligence here, I have yet have an exceptional experience with any of the transportation services offered in LV.

I ordered the Combo Flour Sheet (Banh Uot Bi Cha Thit Nuong) and at the time, it looked delicious and tasted even more delicious, but a few hours into my car ride home to California, I had a massive case of the upset tummy. My other 2 friends and I tried to think of other things I ate (I only had this and some croissant from Belle Pastry next door), but my 2 friends also had some croissants but were ok. So we could only deduce that it had to come from Hue Thai! I hope it's a one time fluke, but it's definitely scared me enough to never come back. On another note, despite the food poisoning, the service was real slow and was not friendly. Their saving grace was the one young guy who would come and ask us how we were doing. The only reason we came here was because Island Malaysian Food next door basically kicked us out by telling us our food would take a very long time to come out.

Like all new Scottsdale bars it is still in the \\\"\"identity crisis\\\"\" stage. The intent was for it to be modern/contemporary sports bar. However, right now they are getting the mix of Scottsdale. Girls in second skin mini dresses rockin 5 in stiletto's standing next to a guy in a t-shirt and a UFC cap. Scottsdale fakes talking about vacation homes, their latest investments, trips and expensive cars while dodging the bill collectors and IRS. All of this sprinkled with a few cougars and older men with their eyes glazed over and wishing someone would define the meaning of it all. Definitely a mid 30 to 50 crowd and most people were dressed up but I think that will change a little once the newness wears off. It's a place to be \\\"\"seen\\\"\" for right now. Prices were as expected. I had wine and it was $10/glass. I didn't try the food, maybe next time. TV's are positioned well if you watch an evening game. They don't open until 3 p.m. but bartender said that will change soon. Speaking of bartenders that is the one negative they don't have enough bartenders for Saturday nights.

Efran, who I normally deal with in the pharmacy, is a great guy- super friendly and always smiling. Monica, the manager, was very responsive and polite when I called her tonight. Hopefully, she will resolve the pharmacist's problem.\\n\\nHowever:\\n\\nI badly injured my finger and it became infected. It is swollen to triple size and a doctor had to slice it open today to drain the puss. The doctor used zero anesthetic, but he had good reason. That's another story.\\n\\nSo he gave me a prescription for 15 Vicodin and 20 antibiotics. I wasn't picking up 200 Oxycontin tablets or doing anything weird. It was a small amount of pain pills and antibiotics to match. My injury was also very visible on my right hand.\\n\\nI was asked for ID, which is understandable, because I was picking up a regulated narcotic. I get that.\\n\\nSo I hand the pharmacist a government issued photo ID. The government ID had a matching address to my prescription. In addition to that, I had an ASU student ID, a credit card (that I was paying for the prescriptions with), and my insurance card ...and I also had a visible injury. A visibly infected injury on my hand, and I was picking up the exact prescription that would match the physical evidence.\\n\\nWhat I'm trying to say is that it was crystal clear that I was who I claimed to be.\\n\\nHowever, the photo ID that I showed was unique.

Instead you get to pick either udon or mei fun (Chinese cellophane rice noodles; yes these were rice noodles but they're not the ones you find in your standard bowl of pho). The broth was either the dark broth (which honestly tasted like can beef broth; very salty) or the vegetable broth (which tasted funny). Definitely suggest you skip this station.\\n\\nHand Roll:\\nTo my excitement I saw sheets of seaweed next to the sushi bar. I asked if those were for hand rolls and the guy said yes. So I asked for a California hand roll...  Nope, only roll they make there is spicy tuna hand roll. Great for tuna lovers, not so great for me.\\n\\nCrab Legs:\\nThey had 2 separate areas where you can find the crab legs. (Good job! Crowd control.) Once you select your legs, you can ask one of the staff to heat it up for you. The legs were hit or miss.

Finally (after the second time of being locked out for nearly an hour) they completely replaced the door handle and lock. \\n\\nTheir receptionists in their VIP check in area were complete bimbos and screwed everything they possibly could up - and Bellagio calls the VIP check in a perk?

I believe there are also 2 more TV's outside behind the bar. \\n\\nAnd to those who feel the need to comment on the decor and refer to it as a dive, you need to hop in your car and head about 15 miles east. it's a place called Scottsdale... you can enjoy the company of your fellow douche bags there.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

After lunch today (a coworker insisted we go there), I think it's finally time to reduce this to one star.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell, in short, it's because they cut every corner they can find.  I've already mentioned the terrible side dishes.  The flavorless mashed potatoes, the garlic-less garlic toast, etc.  The buns they use are terrible; it's dry, spongy, and completely flavorless.  The scoop of ice cream they put on top of the cobbler (which they charge you about $1.50 for) is that yellow garbage you get in those five gallon buckets labeled \\\"\"frozen dairy dessert product.\\\"\"\\n\\nAnd perhaps most indicative of their overall cheapness, they replaced the Henry Weinhard's root beer with that plastic bottled A&W crap some time last year.  Yes, I can tell the difference, and yes, that move alone cost them my business.\\n\\nFor the record, my lunch today (a pulled pork sandwich, a cup of cobbler with a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of water) cost me almost $12.  With a drink, that would have been $14.  For low quality food, those prices are unacceptable.\\n\\nI guess people in Arizona like this garbage.  If someone tells you this place has good food, you can rest assured they either have no taste buds or actually like bad food.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

He tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money. Later I purchased an $800 Hugo Boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered. He made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered. A week later I came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit (good thing I checked). He didn't ask me to try the right one on so I asked if I could make sure it fit. Long story short, he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off. He tried to charge $200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam. He finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments. He didn't know how to work with the modern Hugo Boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs . WHAT A JOKE! I was going to seek legal advice but figured I would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work.

The asian pear and pine nuts was a nice contrast of flavors and textures.  \\n\\nThe world famous Lobster Pot Pie was not impressive to me.  Maybe I had a bad batch, but it was very underwhelming.

We decided we'd check out this Brazilian steakhouse, since we been to a few others and liked what they offered.\\n\\nThe first thing we noticed was that there was no salad bar. When you're seated, they give you the usual Brazilian cheese bread (not as good as the others, imo), which I just found out is called p\\u00e3o de queijo, and some other crackers; with them came chimichurri and pico de gallo. A busser came by with a bowl of salad a few moments later and plopped it down on our plates. Unlike what the menu says, it is not tossed tableside. I think it was prepared prior to our arrival, maybe extra salad that was prepared for some another table, because the greens were a little soggy with dressing. It wasn't terrible, but it looked like it wasn't made for us. Well, actually, the lettuce also looked a little old, so it just might've been wilted because of that rather than soggy. Either way, I wasn't impressed.\\n\\nNext, they came by with side dishes. We were given a bowl of rice and black beans with a dollop of pesto on top, creamed spinach, cooked carrots, and fried plantains. At Texas de Brazil and Via Brasil, they don't give you side dishes unless you order them. At Fogo de Chao, they gave them to us. We were confused at first and thought they accidentally mixed up tables, but I don't know for sure.

Took one bite and I almost cried. All it had was mayo And lettuce. Couldn't tell what I was eating if I closed my eyes.  Two slices of processed meat and one slice of cheese. I should have asked for a refund.  I was starving so I was forced to eat half. Gave the other half to a street dude who looked hungry.  I predict this place will be closed when I return for the spring show in March. With all of the restaurant closings on Mill Ave in the last two years, this place doesn't stand a chance.  I saw at least six new places from when I was here six months ago. No clue why this place is even open for business. I hate Subway and this place is worse.

Was disappointed at the brunch foods available and the service.\\n\\nFood - nothing really stands out, which I guess I should expect considering it is a brunch buffet.  That being said, the bar should not be set so low for any restaurant, and they should not be aiming for the status quo.  .  What's up with the tapa-style fish taco? Didn't know you could put canned tuna in a shell and call it a day.  Or what about their grits?  It was more like dried-out mashed potato looking at the viscosity of it.  Would really like them to step up their food quality, even if it is buffet-style.  Been to plenty of really great brunch buffet places, like the Castaways brunch in Burbank, CA.  \\n\\nService - Hostess was really awkward when we walked in and didn't immediately greet us or ask what we needed--maybe she was new.  The wait was beyond 30 minutes which is understandable.  The other hostess, who was bubblier, asked for our number bc we were going to wander around Phillips Place and told us that she would call when we could be seated.  We returned a little early and just sat outside waiting for a phone call.  She popped her head outside, \\\"\"Oh, didn't know you guys were going to just be waiting outside, you can come inside and I'll seat you.\\\"\"  The problem was that she was more surprised that we were there.  She should have DEFINITELY called us like she said she would.  To catch us on happenstance outside makes me think that we were not a priority, or that she was not going to call us.  Gotta follow up immediately when you extend extra service like that.\\n\\nDishes weren't cleared at a fast enough rate.  Seriously though, it's not like brunch is a new concept at Upstream.  I'm sure the service staff can identify plates that need to be cleared because guests are reloading.

There was food on the carpet, throw up in the toilet, party streamers still on the lamps, food around the refrigerator- that did not work.. Btw.. And this this damp moldy smell that overwhelmed us.. The towels and blankets were ripped and worn.. Just gross! We were moved to a new room but I left some clothes in the old room.. Called three times and asked them to check.. They told me over and over that nothing was left.. My husband met the housekeeping at our old room and he found them in the drawer that we had told them they were in.. Free happy hour appetizer at the pool!! Really- chips and salsa!!! The only choice! We checked our credit card online and there was a multiple of charges and authorizations for the total of 832.63.. Really? We had only stayed there at that time one night! We called and talked to the front desk.. They could not do anything about the charges for 2-4 days... But promised us breakfast discount  coupons that were never there at the front desk..Just truly not worth the all the aggravation .. Just unorganized and dirty!! The only upside flip is the location.. I could walk to trader joes and get much needed wine for dealing with this hotel!!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

        "data": "Review:\nAfter a very difficult summer with no vacation, I decided I had earned a stay-cation.  So, on a whim, I booked a room here.  The property is older, but extremely well- maintained.  The grounds are beautiful and the architectural details are great. The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable.  The bathrooms are covered in marble and everything was very clean. Every single staff member was kind and helpful.  I also had one of the best salads I've had in years at Sangria's Lounge (It's called the California Tomato--it's huge, fresh, and amazing! It's also pretty reasonable--$12.25). The Sunday brunch is expensive ($42 a person) but the food is amazing, the selection is fantastic, and there are bottomless mimosas. If you are staying at the hotel, they will give you a 'buy one, get one free' coupon, which makes the Sunday brunch much more reasonable. They also have a complimentary shuttle that will take you anywhere you want to go, within about 5 miles of the hotel.  It's pretty convenient if you want to go drinking in Old Town or you want to leave your car in shaded/covered hotel parking and walk around downtown.\\n\\nThere are a few minuses that actually would have made me give the property a 3.5 star rating, but as we all know, Yelp doesn't offer that option.  First of all, good luck trying to get consistent cell service.  If you are on vacation, this is a gift.  If you are here on business, it could be a nightmare.  I literally paced the balconies looking for a signal to make calls and send texts on my first night there.  By my third and final day, I embraced the lack of service and turned off my phone. It ended up being kind of nice. I also had a terrible time getting a consistently strong Wi-Fi connection for my laptop, so I gave up and used the business center.  The business center was a sad little room, but the computers worked and so did their Internet connection, so it wasn't a huge issue.\\n\\nThe $19 resort fee is excessive.

The screen and sound were good and so was the idea of having someone come when you needed them by a press of a service button. I'll tell you the truth: I rarely go to the movies these days and it's mostly because of the inconsiderate jerks who use their cell phones, held up as high and bright as possible, to text. Granted, I was literally the only other one in the theatre this time, but I was very prepared to press the button and get anyone kicked out who attempted to ruin yet another good time with their selfish texting.\\n\\nOk...and here's the 50% bad part: the plastic/barely rocking chairs were uncomfortable after awhile. I ran out of my soda 30 minutes into the showing and I pressed the button. Scotty had not returned. I thought maybe it was broken, so after 10 minutes, I turned it off and on again. Still no Scotty. Finally 30 minutes later he came back with the bill and sternly told me to turn off the button as if it was bothering him the whole time. Uh...#1 it wouldn't be bothering you if you came within, say those first 10 minutes and #2 isn't this the perk of being at this theatre?\\n\\nIn addition, he didn't give me a pen to sign the receipt. I wasn't about to use the useless button again, so I just left the merchant copy. Only, I thought it appropriate to tip my waiter and I was going to add it using my card on the little \\\"\"tip line.\\\"\" Finally, I just put a few dollars I had on me in with the bill. Obviously, he didn't come back to get the receipt, so when I left the theatre when the movie was over, I looked for him. He was gone, wherever....\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

I researched and interviewed quite a few places before settling on Animal Care Hospital. The fact that it is so close to me was definitely a factor, but I was impressed with this office regardless of location. I wanted to make sure the vet I chose would be a good fit for my Yorkshire Terrier, so I had plenty of questions to ask and Dr. Bishop graciously answered them all. \\n\\nAnimal Care Hospital has three practicing DVM's on staff, as well as 4 certified veterinary technicians. All 3 vets are members of the AVMA, AAHA, AzVMA and other organizations. Dr. Bishop is the Hospital Director who started the practice in 1973, Dr. Halver has been there since 1981 and Dr. Temple has been here since 2006. They use isofluorane gas anesthesia, which is the safest anesthesia, especially for toy breeds. They also have extensive monitoring equipment is in place during surgery, including EKG, pulse oximeters, respiratory rate, CO2 monitors and equipment to maintain core body temperature. Since almost every dog will be put under at least once to be fixed, it is good to know that they monitor vitals so closely. \\n\\nFor routine appointments, they schedule a full 30 minutes. Many of the vet offices I spoke to scheduled as few as 10 minutes, or maybe 15, not enough time in my opinion to really get acquainted with me or my dog, or to ask any questions or share concerns. This may seem silly, but the amount of time the vet spends with each animal can make a big difference in their health. \\n\\nThe vet I saw , Dr. Temple, was flexible.

I've passed this place so many times but never managed to make it in, as most of my stories start. I swear, when I say this, I mean it - it's been a good 10years. I am not entirely convinced it was worth it. \\n\\nI started with vegetable samosas - that looked like they came out of Costco - pretty forgettable. The boy's prawn puri looked much more (and tasted) much better than my option - it's normally my staple, so I was pretty envious as I looked at my sad samosas. For the main, the boy went for the Marco Polo chicken which he devoured happily, and I had the tandoori trout. Lovely seasoning on the trout, but cooked a little too dry. We also shared the Afghan chickpeas, which were pretty delicious as an accompaniment. Naan was too dry and toasted. \\n\\nNow, I've given it two stars... for why? Well, food-wise, while the main was pleasant, the starter I had was just... eh. I need to find a better word for eh, but at the moment, that's all I can come up with. The mains were pleasant, but in terms of comparing to another restaurant, it isn't food that stands out as memorable, or particular adept at handling the flavours that can be oh-so-amazing or delivered with a blunt hammer. So it would be a 3 star for that.  \\n\\ni drop down to two because I thought the service was pretty lame. Very disinterested, and when you are trying to call the waiter back because he's wandered off halfway through taking your order, that isn't a sign of good service (really, if you think that is, then we need to have a conversation) and doesn't inspire the whole tipping thang, y'know? I'm at a loss for all the praise, as I didn't really experience something that blew my mind, more something that was more mundane than we would have liked.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

Honestly the only reason it gets 2 stars is because hubby liked several of the dishes that I didn't try, like the kafta.

EVERY other restaurant I've ever been to in my life has either correctly assumed that I wanted a glass of water, or asked me to clarify whether I wanted bottled water or not. When the waitress turned up a few minutes later, we asked for glasses of water. After she conferred with someone in the back, we got glasses of lukewarm tap water- with no ice.\\n\\nAnd then, the food. Granted, at a Mediterranean buffet, I expect mostly Mediterranean food, but here even that was too much to ask. Of the four buffet tables full of food, maybe one and a half was food I would have considered Mediterranean, and even some of that was a stretch. Some of the dishes in the buffet included: lasagna (looked frozen), alfredo (gummy and bland), pasta with chicken (just strange), zucchini fries (obviously frozen), fried okra (?), spring rolls (frozen), orange Jell-o squares (huh?). The rice pilaf was too salty and had Jalapeno peppers in it(?). As for the actual Mediterranean food, the stuffed grape leaves were the best of the bunch. As I mentioned, hubby liked the kafta but it was a bit spicy for me. The hummus was bitter- too much tahini. The chicken schwarma tasted like someone tried to alter a recipe for chicken parmesan. Really, the best section overall was the salads. The tabbouleh was decent although it needed more salt to counteract all of the lemon juice.

The service was amazing and the waitress did a good job of explaining the dishes to us.  We decided on the Shrimp & Pork Siu Mai (Very good!) and the Crispy Ocean Noodle dish.  The waitress said the noodle dish was a very large dish, enough for two people.  She must have been talking about the size of the plate rather than the portion, because it was far from a 2-person plate of food.  It was delicious, but there were only three shrimp and they had the heads on.  Some people may like this, but we were grossed out by it.  The waitress was very apologetic about it and said that she should have mentioned that the shrimp came with the heads on.  However, it really should be mentioned on the menu.  Another thing not mentioned on the menu is that there are no free refills on tea.  I had a small glass of iced tea for $4 and since the menu didn't state \\\"\"no refills\\\"\", I asked for seconds assuming it would be free of charge.  I was not told that there would be another $4 charge for the additional tea, so I was very surprised to see the additional charge on our bill.\\n\\nThe food is good, but way overpriced.  The dining room has a casual vibe and the service is amazing, but with food prices this high, I expect a little more, like maybe not having servers in jeans and t-shirts.

On one such gustatory adventure four of us took over a table for six at Buon Gusto, and filled it to overflowing with various dishes.  I appreciated that shakers of grated Parmesan Cheese sat at both ends.  The owners and head chef were not even around, and yet the coordinated operation of the skilled culinary team on a very busy Thursday night still hummed along beautifully under its very able management.  Service was friendly and efficient, with our table checked on several times.  I just had to ask for one water refill twice.\\n\\nWe began with a loaf of excellent baked Italian bread that was both complimentary and warm.  It was so good with butter or vinegar and oil that my party polished off this and another 1-1/2 loaves by meal's end.  Next for me was a good but barely hot small bowl of Italian Wedding Soup with tasty but tiny meatballs and only bits of spinach.  This was really the only low point of my meal.\\n\\nA generous side Caesar Salad with excellent creamy Caesar Dressing, fresh chopped Romaine Lettuce, and crunchy croutons was presented next.  Crab-stuffed Mushrooms were simply excellent, and lightly floured Calamari served with a Sicilian Sauce that tasted like a slightly amped up mild Marinara was very good--one of the best I have experienced in the Vegas valley.\\n\\nA long interval separated appetizers, soup, and salad from the entrees.  But this was understandable, since by this time (about 7:30 p.m.) the place was packed with patrons.  Now we really put the table to the test.

Breads were done in house, flavors were paired well, and the plates were wonderful and felt as sharp and artistic as the restaurant itself.  \\n...Now for how this place lost 3 stars even with some of the better brunch I've experienced in the greater Montreal Metro.  How good is good food, though, when the service is abysmal?  This is not a philosophical experiment on human nature, state of nature, etc.  This was common sense (lack there of it), misapplied.   Honestly, after waiting 20 minutes at the door without even eye contact (no problem had the place been busy) but then the only apology we receive is from a staff member who wasn't working that day.  He was there to enjoy lunch himself. A big thank you to him too, for suggesting some truly wonderful meal ideas.  He knew the menu well.  Now why on Earth am I so thankful to someone who was off today and not my waitress?  It felt like my waitress had zero concern that customers were even about.  And then to find out the owner was in house and could care not?  Enough said.  Perhaps it was an off day, perhaps, we came at a time where they were inconvenienced, but with a smile here, or a simple \\\"\"sorry about this\\\"\" there, and all that weight on our consuming shoulders (and wallets) would have been alleviated.  \\nFood was good enough to want a return, but maybe the experience of this charmer is better kept as the home game.

I also remember that it was quite good, although I again cannot remember at all what I had.  I'm sure they were fairly typical dishes such as mushu or kung pao or something.  Recalling that they were good and being in the mood for Chinese, we made our way here for lunch.\\n\\nFirst of all, no lunch menu on weekends.  We got the menu of dozen pages or so that were just normal dinner dishes - fairly expensive dishes.  Fortunately we were not looking for a lunch menu and wanted the full gamut so it didn't faze us any, but be prepared that it will not be a cheap lunch.  The menu you do get is upscale in both the menu itself and the contents with right balances of seafood and non-seafood.  \\n\\nI was craving some Chinese seafood so we ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup ($10), marinated spicy clams ($14), and sweet & sour crispy rock cod fish ($14).  The soup had plenty of fat wontons and ample amount of seafood, and with the large size it's well worth the price.  Spicy clams were in deep red, spicy sauce, with a hint of mala tingliness.  Loved it.  The sweet & sour was not too sweet, not too sour, with perfectly fried fish that was as tender as can be.  As good as the first two were, this was even better.  With enough unusual items on the menu, this may very well be our go-to Chinese.\\n\\nOur meal came to $50 after all was said and done, but it was the best Chinese we've had in a long, long time.  Service was more pleasant than the typical Chinese restaurants, although it's all relative.  Food came fast, restaurant is clean, and traffic was brisk.  I'm torn between 4 & 5-stars, but let's leave it at 4 until I revisit.

I got in my car and started driving down the road and noticed that my temp guage was rising a bit and looked like the vehicle was running a little warm.

They called and said I needed a new radiator($750.00) and since they had the thing torn apart, they said I should also replace the thermostat($750.00, $1,500.00 total)!!!!!! This did not seem right with lower milage and I'm a price shopper, so I called a few friends for a referral and they sent me to Paul's Car Care in Chandler off of Arizona Avenue between Ray and Warner. They told me the radiator cap was loose and could have not been put on tightly from the oil change or it was malfunctioning. Either way, it was $73.00 and I was out the door!!!! Shame on those guys at Big O who had 2-3 flunkies working on my car and couldn't analyze the problem, except for replacing the whole DAMN cooling system!!!! Obviously it would run fine after that!!!!

It was late in the day so no time and waste - drove to nearest place - Big O tires on Rainbow & Warm Springs.\\n\\nUpon entering the store about 5 pm on a Tuesday, they were not busy at all.  One tech was at one register using his phone, the clerk was talking with 2-3 other friends that came in.  I waited patiently for about 10 minutes with no one responding to me.  Finally the clerk asked if I needed a tire for my boat, I responded yes just one trailer tire comprable to my existing tires.  I felt like I was bothering him, he clearly wasn't interested in working. He charged me about $100 for the tire out the door - mount and balance.  I was happy to be on the road again.\\n\\nThe next day I was looking at the rest of the tires and decied a set would be better as well as upgrading my rims.  After shopping around over the phone I found a good deal on 3 tires and was on my way to pickup.  Upon arriving at the other tire store, I was informed by them that the tire that was installed due to the blowout was not a trailer rated tire.  Needless to say I was shocked and suprised, I'm not a tire expert and trusted they would installl the correct tire.  \\n\\nI immediately called Big O and they told me to come down.  I returned with the tire and was shocked when the same clerk that helped me the day before told me that \\\"\"this tire was not sold and installed to me by their store\\\"\". So basically they were accusing me of buying a tire, mount and balance and the next day returning with a different mounted to the same rim and asking for a refund.  The clerk was rude and said \\\"\"it was impossible for me to have received that tire from them.\\\"\"\\n\\nI asked to speak with his manager who was at a different store, that individual asked me to bring the tire over to his summerlin store.  I did and he refunded me the cost of the tire but not the mount and balance.  He also had the audacity to make sure I came back to...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

From the outside the bright and vividly colored building might make you think that it's some tasty independently owned hole in the wall, but don't fall for the mirage... you're walking into a dungeon of greasy food and bad service. \\n\\nIt took about five minutes to completely be turned off by this place. We sat down and were greeted by what had to be one of the most disinterested waitresses I've ever had. She had this vibe going that made us feel like we were inconveniencing her just by being there... her non-descript facial expression and attitude were overshadowed only by her terrible service; which could best be described as 'going through the motions' (even that is giving her too much credit though). Opening the menu yielded even more dissatisfaction... the menu itself was drab and gimmicky and was full of unflattering pictures of the food; making it feel like a chore to even pick out something that looked appetizing. One thing I noticed immediately that should have been a red flag was that for all of their chicken dishes, they charged about three dollars extra for white meat... that's never a good sign. \\n\\nWe eventually settled on a chorizo breakfast quesadilla and their sampler platter which included one of just about everything on the menu. The breakfast quesadilla was massive... it must've weighed about three pounds, the taste was okay but it was dripping with grease and after just a few bites it was hard to stomach any more of it. Our other dish; the sampler platter could best be described as a plate of hot garbage. The assortment of food was thrown on the plate and absolutely smothered with cheese... way too much cheese; in fact the plate itself was literally swimming in cheese which almost seemed to be liquefied... more than likely just an artery clogging mixture of melted cheese and grease. The meal was such a grease bomb that we probably ate about 20 percent of it, yet we felt like our stomachs were...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

My companions were equally as weak and lightheaded, so we went for the closest place to eat that would accomodate our various criteria (veggie options, relatively cheap, and had to have roast beef sandwiches-as per one of our party's demands.)\\n\\nWe were seated immediately by 9:50 and given menus.  The waitress took 15 minutes to even make eye contact with our table (and it was NOT busy in this place, she was in the back room.)  When we went around the table and began to order, she informed us that it is now 10:05 and that they were no longer making the food on the menu she had offered us, and that we could only order from one of the three pages we were given.  \\n\\nWTF!\\n\\nWe complained vociferiously that it was not our fault she was taking a snooze in the back and wasn't on her game, and that they should honour us paying customers who arrived before their cut off time and who were provided with dinner menus-not the late night menus.  No go. We were stuck with appetizers only.\\n\\n40 minutes later, I had my greasy chicken tenders, 3 carrot sticks and 3 sticks of celery.  They did not bring the sauces (bbq and ranch) described with the item-and when I requested them the waitress looked at me as if I had just told her I wanted her to wash my car with her tongue. So I got treated like I was being the bitch, when really I just didn't want to eat the nasty ass chicken without the fake flavors that were described on the menu.\\n\\nOverall, my companions were disgusted with their meals as well, especially the nachos.

All the staff are willing to make weird concoctions I dream up of.

Marco the manager always talks to customers, asking for opinions, and looking for ways to make the place a little more comfortable.\\n\\nThe taste of the coffee here is a well balance of savory, bitter, and sweet. Desserts here are made in-house and very fresh. The sandwiches are always great. But what brings me here is the Tiramisu and Nutellamisu, both made in house. Perfect accompaniment to a hot drink in the twilight hours. \\n\\nI really love the environment here: lounge-ish, calm, hip hop, dance, trance music always playing in the background provides a mildly serene vibe for me. I'm usually here in the wee-hours of the night to study, normal hours are usually crowded so you might have to find your niche in time slots. 24/7 cafe and free wifi with purchase really make this place the perfect package.

The ambiance and table setup strike a nice mix of casual and refinement. you're going to be comfortable there whoever you are. The server Jessica was a pleasure and seemed to guess right that I was on a date, so she acted accordingly which was a nice touch...you know, adding a little more formality and checking in frequently with suggestions to the wine and drink list. She suggested the green thing and freaky squirrel for cocktails and they were both very good. We had the pork belly appetizer which was very tender and complimented the large bread basket well. We skipped getting a salad which was good idea because the entrees were surprisingly large cuts of meat. I had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin which was exceptional. I suggest when the server asks you how you want it cooked, to just let the chef decide at a place like this. It was perfect. The other entree was the double pork chops still on the bone and it was beyond tender and flavorful. Easily the best pork chop I've tasted and my date couldn't finish it all if that gives you an idea on the portion. Both were served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus was cooked properly but the mashed potatoes could probably have used some cream in them, not bad but i'm picky on simple sides like that. The biggest thumbs up I can give is that the steak arrived hot. If you get steaks/cuts of meat at restaurants, you know this to be one of the most anticipated moments and i'm usually very disappointed, but not this time. The food was promptly brought and it makes a difference. The biggest let down of the meal was the dessert, We ordered the doughnuts and they were more like flavorless hush puppies. A bit too dense and overcooked, these doughnuts just didn't do it for me but my date seemed to enjoy them.

If they are full (or beyond 98% full) they know they will have to upgrade a portion of the rooms anyways, so if you go early they might give you the upgrade.

From the outside the bright and vividly colored building might make you think that it's some tasty independently owned hole in the wall, but don't fall for the mirage... you're walking into a dungeon of greasy food and bad service. \\n\\nIt took about five minutes to completely be turned off by this place. We sat down and were greeted by what had to be one of the most disinterested waitresses I've ever had. She had this vibe going that made us feel like we were inconveniencing her just by being there... her non-descript facial expression and attitude were overshadowed only by her terrible service; which could best be described as 'going through the motions' (even that is giving her too much credit though). Opening the menu yielded even more dissatisfaction... the menu itself was drab and gimmicky and was full of unflattering pictures of the food; making it feel like a chore to even pick out something that looked appetizing. One thing I noticed immediately that should have been a red flag was that for all of their chicken dishes, they charged about three dollars extra for white meat... that's never a good sign. \\n\\nWe eventually settled on a chorizo breakfast quesadilla and their sampler platter which included one of just about everything on the menu. The breakfast quesadilla was massive... it must've weighed about three pounds, the taste was okay but it was dripping with grease and after just a few bites it was hard to stomach any more of it. Our other dish; the sampler platter could best be described as a plate of hot garbage. The assortment of food was thrown on the plate and absolutely smothered with cheese... way too much cheese; in fact the plate itself was literally swimming in cheese which almost seemed to be liquefied... more than likely just an artery clogging mixture of melted cheese and grease. The meal was such a grease bomb that we probably ate about 20 percent of it, yet we felt like our stomachs were...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I received a phone call at 3:00am and my flight was at 6:45am. When I called to inquire about this and to reschedule, I was told that my flight was cancelled for aircraft maintenance. Had I received more advanced notice, I would've adjusted my plans. The woman I spoke with over the telephone was completely unapologetic and offered no sympathy, she told me that I could get on a 5pm flight, or she could issue me a refund. As much as I would've loved to stay in LV, I had to get home that day, so I gritted my teeth and took the late flight. \\n\\nThe man who assisted me when I checked in was more helpful, he arranged several standby flights for me and after one failed attempt, I was able to get on a flight bound for Phoenix around 12pm. I was supposed to connect to Houston from Phoenix, but he didn't apparently forgot to arrange this part for me.\\n\\nThe only part of my experience that was pleasant was the assistance I received in the US Airways Club in Phoenix. The woman at the front counter was able to get me a 4pm flight to Houston, and it was relatively painless on my end. She apologized profusely for my experience, and she was very efficient and courteous. Hats off to her, she takes US Airways from 1 to 2 stars. Of course, the flight ended up being delayed, and we didn't depart from Phoenix until 6pm. Aircraft maintenance again, apparently.\\n\\nIt's ridiculous how many of their flights are overbooked. On my way to Las Vegas, they were asking for volunteers step down and fly a different day because the flight was so full. I heard one of their staff members say that a flight from Vegas to LAX was overbooked by 15 people. \\n\\nPick a different airline. Southwest, United, Continental...anything but US Airways.

One of the rooms was a handicap-accessible room, which is fine, but there was no counterspace in the bathroom and no closet, but instead a wardrobe that was REALLY small.

It was a Friday morning so it was not particularly crowded.  I would say it was about two-thirds full.  On a Saturday or a Sunday, I would imagine it would be a bit more crowded.  Our waitress was fine, although a bit slow when it came to keeping our water glasses full.  My wife and I are not coffee drinkers and so she had water and I had a hot tea.  There was always someone around with a coffee pot, but getting water was a little more tricky.  Other than that, no complaints.\\n\\nFood:  4/5\\n\\nI was trying to eat semi-healthy, so I ordered the oatmeal with a bran muffin.  The muffin was served warm and was excellent.  The oatmeal was a good consistency, something I am a bit picky about.  My wife ordered an omelet and was satisfied with the amount of filling in it.  We also shared an order of crepes.  Now I had never had crepes before so I can't compare them to anything I've had before, but they were good... crispy on the edges with fresh blackberries and whipped cream.  Overall, a satisfying, better than average meal.\\n\\nOverall Impressions:  4/5\\n\\nCrackers is a comfortable looking cafe.  I'm a little biased against restaurants that don't have booths right now as that is the easiest way for my wife and I to sit with our young son.  It's interesting the kinds of things you notice or care about when you have to account for a baby.  But other than that, the atmosphere at Crackers is very nice and hospitable.\\n\\nI would definitely say that Crackers is superior to our usual trip to the Waffle House when we are visiting Phoenix.

After missing the first delivery date of the clothes (both of the pants were the wrong length and width as well as the jacket), here we are after barely 3 wears of the clothes and the alterations are coming apart.  It is a worst tailor job that I've ever seen, the hemming haphazardly finished and many shortcuts in sewing taken.  I can pay about 5% as much and take them somewhere else to have a better job.\\n\\nGo to Stitched if you're buying something that they've bought from another place (like cufflinks or pocket handkerchiefs), if you don't mind paying more and already have your bottle of Scotch parked in their cabinet.  Don't let that designer fabric selection fool you, the in-house construction will be very inferior.

Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't impressed.\\n\\nFirst off, the kimchi is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the kimchi, but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre kimchi.  Not this kimchi.  You'll get this as an appetizer, so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it.  Our server (the owner?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the kimchi, being the kimchi fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The crust was kind of thick, but not greasy at all.  The meat was delicious, great spice and herb flavor.  A good sign of things to come...\\n\\nI ordered the Hot Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.  Quality beef, super fresh veggies, and really nice Kochujang(?) sauce.  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly flavored.  What set this dish apart for me was the high quality for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized rice grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of kimchi, I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last rice grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean dish!\\n\\nI also managed to taste my friend's bulgolgi.  I normally don't like bulgolgi because it is always tough and overly sauced.  Not this bulgolgi, which is the best I have ever had.  VERY tender, and expertly seasoned.  The sauce was light and of a homemade quality.  Just delicious!\\n\\nAgain, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean food, this is the place to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean food, this is the place to go when you do.  If you are a Korean food snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

I'm not buying it whatsoever, that this has ANY real lemon content. Ok, so now that final taco, the carne asada. I had high hopes since the other two were so bland I thought maybe it'd be harder to mess up carne asada, but I was wrong. It had absolutely no flavor, and had a horrid texture I don't know if the meat was overcooked or what but it tasted like a taco with beans and cardboard. I had to douse it in lime and hot sauce to make it edible, and still bearly was so, partly because the hot sauce they provide is not so tasty either. \\n\\nI didn't look for a restroom, but I imagine they have one, as they would never be allowed to build the restaurant without at least one public restroom.

He brought us extra fries, napkins, even checked on us to see how we were doing! We ended up tipping him and just left her a few dollars. I understand if you're having a bad night, you may be off your game, but holy shit at least come by and let us know you're busy, if that's even the case. Oh and another thing- the manager took his time going to every table to ask how their meal was, except for us. Is it because we are a younger couple? Honestly I have noticed since we are in our late 20's, we receive shit service. Regardless of age, we are respectful, easy going, tip generously, but I guess that's not enough.

I ordered my pizza and wings for pick up and I head that way check in on yelp and find out they have a 2 liter special, though I didn't qualify for it as I didn't order a 16-18' pizza but I saved it for next time, although the low carb pizza does not come that big I will have to figure something else out. Wings are great not as saucy as I like them as I usually dip my pizza in the sauce. The pizza I ordered 12' veggie with cheese low carb option they are usually on point but for some reason it tasted very salty like they over seasoned the veggies not so enjoyable. \\nThe bad \\nThe area can get crowded and the parking lot attendant will give you a dirty look to make sure you aren't using the lot for the Vig parking.\\nOverall\\nI will be back if I have coupon but with the customer service here I don't think this will be my go to place anymore.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

But comparing the two, this is worst although closer to the strip and normal traffic than the one by the LVCC.\\n\\nThis is my 2nd trip using this Residence Inn and I was satisfied because I have a dog and not too many places allow you to bring your dog in a hotel in Las Vegas.  Red Rock in Summerlin did (see the previous review of that place).  The trip was not planned at all, my father died unexpectedly and we drove down to Vegas immediately to see my mother (I never stay at the house because of the dog and my partner, Brian -he needs his space).  Since the last time we were in Vegas, and needed something close to my Parents, I used this place I did not search, I just booked it.\\n\\nSo nothing different than the last time, the suite (all of their rooms have a small furnished kitchen to cook if you stay longer than a day or two) is okay.  Furnishings are standard, appliances clean but old.  Breakfast on same time on a small eating area with basic stuff, rolls, cereal, eggs, bacon, coffee and juices.\\n\\nThis last stay however was not a happy occassion.  I only slept in the hotel room once because I had to stay with my mother the other two nights we were in Vegas arranging the funeral services for my father.  On the night I did stay, I noticed that several more people were in the lot on the building we were staying than normal.  Of course, Sat night - maybe someone is having a party - understandable. \\n\\nHowever, I didn't like that the guests of the guest were propping the door open so that they can go in and  out of the bldg.  Someone had stuck a hard gum on the edge so the door does not lock after them.  Instinct always tells me to just take the gum off but since I knew that the group saw us come in and knows that our room is just by the door, I didn't wan to give them a reason to be angry.  They also know where we parked our car.  I do want to say that at no time did the party ever bother us since it was several rooms farther than ours....\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Good.",

This place is a complete dive, though.  The owner/manager seems to not care about service or customer complaints at all.  \\n\\nI took my parents out to dinner for Father's Day.  We had a party of six when we came to The Pitts Again and it took us 30 minutes to get seated because there isn't a manager on the floor making sure that tables are being bused or that the customers are being taken care of in a timely manner.  The service is by far the worst that I have ever had dining out.  The servers are inattentive, uncaring, and speed isn't even in the vocabulary of this place.  It took us two hours from the time that we arrived until the time we left.  Plus to add insult to injury they stuck me with an 18% gratuity for service that was pitiful.  I went ahead and paid for it not to make a scene and ruin Father's Day for my Dad.  Later that evening I called asking for a manager and was told that he was currently busy at the moment so I left a message for him to call me back.  I never received a call back so I decided to email them to express my disappointment of having to pay 18% gratuity to a server who in my eyes didn't deserve it at all.  This is coming from a guy who was a server all through college so I know what it's like.  Let's just say that it is now the end of July and I still haven't received a call nor a response to my email which leads me to believe that the owner doesn't care a bit about the customers.  It makes me sad because I refuse to ever go back due to the way I was treated even though I have to say their BBQ is the best in Arizona.\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

If a burrito tears the really should re-wrap it instead of giving it to a customer and no one likes stale nachos. But the killing blow came when they got rid of the Mol\\u00e9 burrito. It really set them apart from the competition and their mol\\u00e9 sauce was amazingly tasty. Even the more \\\"\"authentic\\\"\" local restaurants in the area have not made a mol\\u00e9 that tasted as good. They replaced it with a rather disgusting BBQ burrito that pales in comparison.

Wow - Thank you so much for doing your job!  After being sat, we waited and waited....and waited until finally flagging down our server.  she was the only server working, but the restaurant was not even busy - she had maybe 3 or 4 other tables but seemed completely overwhelmed.  We placed our entire order (since we were only there during our lunch hour) - and also because we weren't sure when we'd see her again.  The hummus arrived, and I will admit: it was delicious.  HOWEVER, the portion size was absurd - It was barely more than 2 tablespoons of hummus on the plate.  Give me a break!  We got the lemongrass chicken wrap, which I would definitely go back for (for takeout only) - and we also ordered the italian sandwich, which was just OK.  \\nThe ambience in Elixir is awful - It's a nice-sized space with potential, but is decorated in a way that makes it look tacky, cold and unwelcoming.

It looked more like a Jell-O mold one would see sitting on a picnic table underneath a pavilion, during a 1980's family reunion versus a pricey lobster salad in a respectable restaurant.  Had the server not said what she was handing me I would have had no clue. \\n  \\nAfter I toppled over my cylinder of \\\"\"salad\\\"\", I discovered a base of shredded/chopped iceberg lettuce.  I can somewhat understand using only iceberg lettuce in a cobb salad, but must say I was a little surprised.  My surprise quickly turned into disillusionment with regards to the quality of the lettuce; it just might have been borrowed from the Subway sandwich shop next door.  Used as filler for a $5 Footlong fine, used as the base of a $19.95 salad, not fine. \\n  \\nThe entire production had clearly been premade and kept in a refrigerated area for some time.  The lettuce was soggy and extremely cold.  It wasn't cool, but cold to the point it felt as though it was pulled out just prior to freezing.  The salts from the bacon, blue cheese and dressing broke the lettuce completely down, giving it an watery leftover taste and consistency.  I could easily envision myself eating this straight out of a Tupperware container. \\n  \\nThe avocado was discolored and turning brown, another indication it had been premade and stored.  I understand avocado can quickly discolor, but this sure didn't give me the feeling I was eating anything freshly prepared or of anything of quality. \\n  \\nAt one point I bit into something that was inedible.  I thought perhaps it was a tiny piece of shell from the lobster, turns out it was a piece of bacon that must have been dislodged from the bottom of the fry pan with force as to not waste any product.  It was burnt and had the consistency of bone, not a pleasant bite to say...\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

Maybe I came in with incredibly high expectations but I found that the hype of this place far outweighs what you get. I was not particularly impressed with any dish I received, to be completely honest. While the restaurant is not \\\"\"bad\\\"\" by any means, it seems as though it's coasting on a name, rather than the quality of the food. The Witchery seems to do food that is very classic, which is great if that's what you're looking for. However, I was expecting the classic food to have something which set it apart from other restaurants like it. In short, I saw nothing like that and was served a few fancy looking dishes that were not nearly the calibre of food I would expect from a place this \\\"\"legendary\\\"\" or in such a price point. I have eaten at several world class restaurants and have experienced better dishes at a fraction of the price in more cosmopolitan hubs (Vegas, NYC, etc). \\n\\nNot only that, but I found the service to be dismal overall. The servers were very kind but not attentive enough. I recognize that there can be a cultural divide between American (which I find far too hands on) and British service but this didn't even begin to straddle the line. We were left to our own devices with only a check in every half hour (if that).

We had the chicken foot soup which was great. Then we ordered the oxtail with rice and peas and plantain and my daughter was talked into getting the fish. This is where it starts going down hill. The rice and peas tasted as if it was old and the oxtail was just ok and was missing the butter beans. Then my daughter's dish was $18 and I noticed that she got half of the fish while the server was eating the other half. I could be wrong but my daughter got the tail end of the fish and the server was eating the head portion of it in her dinner. Then after we finished our soda's we wanted some water and was given bottled water which ran $1.99 a piece, now I see in Vegas that you can go to the store and get a 24 pack of water for $2.99 or less so I felt a little ripped off.

This time, it was so hard to stay awake, and it's not because I was drinking and partying all day (well..). Anyway the way I see it, it's like Swan Lake on actual water with some cool circus tricks.

I don't think it portrays Cirque's unique talents, special effects, and overall production to its' highest potential. \\n\\nIf this show existed by itself, I would applaude them for everything they have accomplished creating this show. I still do think they deserve a lot of credit because none of it is easy. I just know that there are a lot of other Cirque productions that have seriously left me (O.O) walking out of the theatre, that I can't praise this one with such a high review. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this show to an older crowd looking for a romantic, elegant evening.

Since Happy Hour is like a religion to me, this was unacceptable and I would not be patronizing their establishment.  However, I have great news for everyone (including them): DEL FRISCO'S NOW HAS HAPPY HOUR.  And it's a good one!  SEVEN days a week and it lasts til SEVEN each day.  We're talking double sevens here people, they really impressed me with that!\\n\\nThe ever eloquent Lance S. and I went before a movie last weekend and it was damn good.  Just a side note: Lance has been mixing coconut water with rum and using it as a hangover cure for at least a year now.  Del Frisco actually legitimized it and turned it into a drink called \\\"\"The Morning After\\\"\" and it is delicious.  I had the Jalapeno Marg which was pretty standard for a drink that many have added to their drink menu, but still good.\\n\\nThe real food standout was the tomato basil flatbread.  For $6 it's about the size of a small pizza (6 square slices) and the tomatoes are so freaking fresh, I started reminiscing about that Seinfeld epsisode where George is pondering why the tomato \\\"\"never really took off as a hand fruit\\\"\".  I would probably eat Del Frisco's tomatoes like an apple if given the chance, that's how wonderful they were.\\n\\nAll in all, a great addition to Esplanade, especially with the AMC Theater being my new most favorite theater in the world.  We'll be moving right next door in a week and I'm really glad Del Frisco's decided to come back from the dark side and add itself into my rotation.  I'm a fan!\n\nOverall rating (Good or Bad): Bad.",

When he did bring our food order, the food must have been sitting for awhile. The fries with the burgers were cold, the bartender/waiter had mixed up two of the orders, and then there was the posole.

The first two weeks I attempted the 5 AM park workouts but mornings are not my thing and my allergies hated me and the evening classes were not available at a location near me.  They were nice enough to let me finish out my workouts at their indoor facility where for the remainder I tried to go 3-4x a week.  \\n\\nThe park workouts were challenging but doable at whatever your fitness level.  Richene always mixed it up and was encouraging.  And I loved Fun Fridays.  I had never played Frisbee football before. \\n\\nMy fave would have to be the indoor workouts with Corey and Will.  Because these were in the evenings it really kept me on track eating healthy during the day so I wouldn't feel like crap at boot camp.  And obviously no grass, no allergies.

The indoor facility is perfect for those that are fans of Tough Mudder, Spartan or any type of obstacle races as they have the course and equipment to help you prepare.  \\n\\nThe camaraderie is awesome and everyone is so encouraging from day one.  I'm only knocking a star due to cost.  I don't think $150 a month is unreasonable if boot camps are the majority of your workout because there are classes and locations all over town and the instruction alone is worth it.  They also have a $25 drop in or if you buy a punch card it breaks down to $20 a class.   But for me I'd want to incorporate bootcamp into my schedule once or twice a week because I also love my cycling and kettle bell classes and when I factor in the three gym memberships I have combined those set me back only $57 a month.  \\n\\nI had taken boot camp classes before in town and this month of classes made me realize how much I miss them.
